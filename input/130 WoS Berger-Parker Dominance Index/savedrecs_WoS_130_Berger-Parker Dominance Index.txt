Forest Fuel Bed Variation in Tropical Coastal Freshwater Forested Wetlands Disturbed by Fire								FORESTS				15	1					158	10.3390/f15010158			JAN 2024	2024	Tropical coastal freshwater forested wetlands in coastal regions are rapidly disappearing as a result of various disturbance agents, mainly wildfires caused by high accumulations of forest fuels. The objective of this study was to characterize the structure and composition of fuel beds in tropical coastal freshwater forested wetlands with three levels of disturbance at El Casta & ntilde;o, La Encrucijada Biosphere Reserve. Seventeen sampling units were used to describe the structure of the forest's fuel beds (canopy, sub-canopy, and understory). Fallen woody material and litter (surface and fermented) were characterized using the planar intersection technique. Diversity comprised eight species of trees, two shrubs, five lianas, and two herbaceous species. The vertical strata were dominated by trees between 2 and 22 m in height. The horizontal structure had a higher percentage of trees with normal diameter between 2.5 and 7.5 cm (61.4%) of the total. Sites with low disturbance had the highest arboreal density (2686 ind. ha(-1)). Diversity of species showed that the Fisher, Margalef, Shannon, and Simpson alpha indices were higher in the low disturbance sites. The Berger-Parker index exhibited greater dominance in the sites with high disturbance. Pachira aquatica Aubl. Showed the highest importance value index and was the largest contributor to fuel beds. Sites with the highest disturbance had the highest dead fuel load (222.18 +/- 33.62 Mg ha(-1)), with woody fuels of classes 1, 10, and 1000 h (rotten) being the most representative. This study contributes to defining areas prone to fire in these ecosystems and designing prevention strategies.

Antibiotic resistance, bacterial transmission and improved prediction of bacterial infection in patients with antibody deficiency								JAC-ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE				5	6					dlad135	10.1093/jacamr/dlad135			NOV 1 2023	2023	Background Antibody-deficient patients are at high risk of respiratory tract infections. Many therefore receive antibiotic prophylaxis and have access to antibiotics for self-administration in the event of breakthrough infections, which may increase antimicrobial resistance (AMR).Objectives To understand AMR in the respiratory tract of patients with antibody deficiency.Methods Sputum samples were collected from antibody-deficient patients in a cross-sectional and prospective study; bacteriology culture, 16S rRNA profiling and PCR detecting macrolide resistance genes were performed. Bacterial isolates were identified using MALDI-TOF, antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disc diffusion and WGS of selected isolates was done using Illumina NextSeq with analysis for resistome and potential cross-transmission. Neutrophil elastase was measured by a ProteaseTag immunoassay.Results Three hundred and forty-three bacterial isolates from sputum of 43 patients were tested. Macrolide and tetracycline resistance were common (82% and 35% of isolates). erm(B) and mef(A) were the most frequent determinants of macrolide resistance. WGS revealed viridans streptococci as the source of AMR genes, of which 23% also carried conjugative plasmids linked with AMR genes and other mobile genetic elements. Phylogenetic analysis of Haemophilus influenzae isolates suggested possible transmission between patients attending clinic. In the prospective study, a negative correlation between sputum neutrophil elastase concentration and Shannon entropy alpha-diversity (Spearman's rho = -0.306, P = 0.005) and a positive relationship with Berger-Parker dominance index (rho = 0.502, P < 0.001) were found. Similar relationships were noted for the change in elastase concentration between consecutive samples, increases in elastase associating with reduced alpha-diversity.Results Three hundred and forty-three bacterial isolates from sputum of 43 patients were tested.

Similar relationships were noted for the change in elastase concentration between consecutive samples, increases in elastase associating with reduced alpha-diversity.Conclusions Measures to limit antibiotic usage and spread of AMR should be implemented in immunodeficiency clinics. Sputum neutrophil elastase may be a useful marker to guide use of antibiotics for respiratory infection.

However, floristic studies on these mountains have not been conducted. In this study, human activities and their impacts on the species diversity and soil characteristics of these mountains were considered. The current study aims to investigate: plant species distribution, species richness, life forms of plant species and the impact of soil composition on these parameters across the scanned mountains. A total of 48 species belonging to 44 genera and 23 families are recorded. The largest represented families were Fabaceae and Asteraceae. The spectrum of life-form showed that the most frequent life form was Therophyte. The major chorotypes distribution in the two studied mountains was investigated. Using of A Two-Way Indicator Species (TWINSPAN) technique on the relative importance values (IV) of the recorded species in 20 sampled stands distinguished six vegetation groups: two were representing Thawr mountain communities and four were representing Eir mountain communities, which was visualized through Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA). A Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) was applied on the six TWINSPAN groups to explore the correlations between the generated vegetation groups and the different environmental parameters; stands of Eir mountain were highly correlated with elevation, longitude, latitude and pH while Thawr mountain stands showed a correlation with Ca++, TDS, EC, Carbonate, Nitrate and Mg++. It was found that Eir mountain gained the highest species richness and dominance according to the Berger-Parker formula while evenness, abundance and diversity reached their maximum values at Thawr mountain. It is concluded that human impacts may have a negative effect on species abundance, evenness and diversity at Eir mountain as compared with those of Thawr mountain. So authors recommend planning an ecological restoration strategy to maintain the diversity level at Eir mountain.

Species diversity and spatial distribution of mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) from La Isla Amazon Park, Napo Province, Ecuador								REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL				71						e55184	10.15517/rev.biol.trop..v71i1.55184			JAN-DEC 2023	2023	Introduction: Vector-borne diseases are prevalent in the Amazon and Coastal regions of Ecuador. However, there is a scarcity of mosquito ecology studies in these areas. The most recent list of species reported for the country comprises 8 tribes, 22 genera, and 200 species. Objectives: To document the Culicidae species found in La Isla Amazon Park, Napo, Ecuador, including those with epidemiological significance; and to analyze their composition, abundance, and diversity, focusing on larval habitats during the dry and rainy periods. Methods: We evaluated different larval habitats, considering collection duration as the primary criterion. We used CDC and Shannon traps to collect adult mosquitoes during both rainy and dry periods. To assess sampling effort, we used accumulation curves and non-parametric estimators of species richness, while we employed Hill numbers to determine diversity. Additionally, we used the Berger-Parker and Pielou indices to evaluate species dominance and evenness. We conducted cluster analysis and ANOSIM tests to assess the similarity between habitats and the differences in taxonomic composition between periods. Results: We collected a total of 802 individuals from 15 species and 4 taxonomic units, 5 genera, and 4 tribes. Notably, this may be the first records of Wyeomyia felicia Dyar & Nunez Tovar and Culex derivator Dyar & Knab from Ecuador. Additionally, the presence of Culex dunni Dyar and Psorophora ferox von Humboldt (both recog-nized as vectors) was correlated with increased rainfall. Conclusions: The abundance of mosquitoes, including potential vector species, increased during the rainy sea-son, indicating a higher risk of pathogen transmission. However, the relationship between rainfall amount and diversity patterns is not well-defined.

In Argentina, the application of pesticides in extensive and intensive crops for weed and insect control has increased by more than 400 % over the last 20 years. This study aimed to determine the effect of chlorantraniliprole applied under field conditions on predators and parasitoids associated with Rachiplusia nu (Guenee) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae). Phytophagous and predatory organisms were recorded in chlorantraniliprole-treated and untreated field plots during the 2014-2015 crop season. R. nu larvae were collected, individually placed in Petri dishes, and reared in a conditioned growth chamber until adult Lepidoptera or parasitoids appeared. Data were analyzed with the generalized linear mixed model. In untreated plots, the parasitoid Copidosoma sp. reduced the R. nu population growth curve below the economic injury level. In chlorantraniliprole-treated fields, differences before and after application were significant (p > 0.05), indicating that the insecticide affected predators (Araneidae, Syrphidae, Hemiptera) and parasitoids (Hymenoptera). Additionally, the Berger-Parker dominance index showed parasitoids were more sensitive to chlorantraniliprole than predators. Future research on selective insecticides with other action modes would be needed to evaluate sublethal effects on natural enemies.

There are few species records of this reserve. Hence, the main objective was to inventory the vascular flora of both hills; the specific objectives, to determine the diversity and richness of species in the Reserva Forestal Guanito, to document their biogeographic distribution, conservation status and life forms, and to register the floristic composition variation.Methods: Three plots of 10 x 10 m and two transects of 60 x 2 m were made on each hill, based on the species expression minimum area, and they were located in the areas with dense plant cover. The Shannon diversity index, Berger-Parker dominance index and Jaccard similarity coefficient were calculated.Key results: In the dry forest 81 species were recorded, distributed in 72 genera and 31 families; in the semi-deciduous forest, 110 species belonging to 96 genera and 50 families were registered. Fabaceae was the richest family in genera number on both hills (eight and nine, respectively), and Tillandsia the richest genus in species number (six and five, respectively). Tillandsia recurvata stands out with the highest abundance of individuals (173 individuals) in the dry forest, and Savia sessiliflora (39) in the semi-deciduous forest. The Shannon index showed that the semi-deciduous forest has more diversity than the dry forest, and the results of the Jaccard coefficient indicated that both hills have a highly differentiated floristic compo-sition.Conclusions: This study reaffirms the importance and floristic richness of the forests of the Domincan Republic and at the same time constitutes the first floristic inventory for the Reserva Forestal Guanito.

This pest is described as invasive, especially in the current climate change dispensation. It is important to investigate the population dynamics of C. partellus for better management practices. We studied the species abundance distribution (SAD) models and some biodiversity indices of three major stem bores, C. partellus, Ostrinia nubilalis and Sesamia nonagrioides as these are the most common and major stem borers of maize in the Mediterranean Region. With the help of light traps, weekly catches of the three major maize stem borers were collected during two maize growing seasons (first cropping and second cropping seasons) in 2018 and 2019. The results showed that C. partellus emerged earlier (April-May) and was very dominant throughout the first cropping season of maize. Ostrinia nubilalis and S. nonagrioides emerged late in June-July, and its population remained low throughout the first cropping season. The population structure of all three stem borers was similar throughout the second cropping season of maize. The relative abundance (RA) of C. partellus was significantly higher than that of O. nubilalis and S. nonagrioides in the first cropping (p <.0001) when compared to the second cropping season (p >.05) for both years. In the first cropping season for both years, no SAD model fitted the observed species distribution, although Fisher's log series was relatively similar. In the second cropping for both years, the geometric series distribution model fitted the observed SAD. The Berger-Parker dominance index was greater for the first cropping season than that of the second, whereas the opposite was true for the Simpson's evenness and evenness of Pielou. High RA of C. partellus and the geometric series distribution observed in the second cropping are indicative of a possible dominant status of the C. partellus in the Mediterranean Region of Turkey. Our findings indicated that seasonality is a fundamental driving factor influencing the distribution of the three major stem borers of maize in the Mediterranean Region. In addition, the long and warmer winters could be the reason for the dominance of C. partellus as indicated by the diversity indices.

Diversity of Benthic Macroinvertebrates in Sungai Jeriau, Bukit Fraser, Pahang, Malaysia								SAINS MALAYSIANA				51	8			2365	2375		10.17576/jsm-2022-5108-03			AUG 2022	2022	Sungai Jeriau is a pristine river and is not significantly affected by anthropogenic activities. This river is therefore predicted to have good water quality and support high aquatic diversity. A study was undertaken to determine the water quality status and benthic macroinvertebrate diversity as well as to identify potential benthic macroinvertebrates as biological indicators of highland ecosystems. Sampling was undertaken in April of 2020 and nine sampling stations were sampled to represent Sg. Jeriau and one of its tributaries. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled using a Surber sampler and in-situ measurements were undertaken for water conductivity, dissolved solids, pH, river velocity, river water temperature and dissolved oxygen using YSI 885 meter. In regard to the National Water Quality Standard (NWQS), Sg. Jeriau is in good shape and classified as Class I based on every parameter. A Kurskal-Wallis test demonstrated that the majority of water quality values between stations differ significantly (p<0.05, alpha=0.05) except water temperature, which was constant between stations. A total of 3085 benthic macroinvertebrates that consists of 1 phylum, 2 classes, 8 orders and 52 families were recorded. The studied river was dominated by Elmidae and Scirtidae (Order: Coleoptera), Baetidae and Heptangeniidae (order: Ephemeroptera), Hydropsychidae and Perlidae (order: Trichoptera) followed by Tipulidae, Chironomidae and Simulidae (order: Diptera). Shannon diversity index average was 2.56 +/- 0.17. Pielou evenness index (0.76 +/- 0.09), Margalef richness index (4.99 +/- 1.72) and reciprocal Berger-Parker index (4.54 +/- 1.51) indicated that the ecosystem was between fair to good quality. The Shannon diversity value was slightly low due to a high dominance by the above-mentioned families as well as calculations made at the family level. Benthic invertebrates exhibited high variation (70%) and CCA analysis demonstrated that conductivity, water temperature and dissolved oxygen had significant influence on Elmidae, Chironomidae and Baetidae. Monte Carlo tests exhibited significant variation in axis 1 of the CCA analysis (p.0.05) for conductivity and dissolved oxygen. These results demonstrates that Sg. Jeriau supports high Elmidae, Chironomidae and Baetidae and these families have high potential as good biological indicators for highland ecosystems.

Bacterial colony and cell morphology served as crude but statistically significant endpoints for detecting alteration in culturable gut bacteria following F. heteroclitus short-term captive housing. 16S rRNA sequence analyses of isolates from short-term captive-housed F. heteroclitus produced fewer families (68%), genera (69%), and species (63%) identities resulting in lower species richness (63%), 2.4-fold lower Margalef's Index, 1.7-fold lower Menhinick's Index, 28.6% lower Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index, 2.1-fold greater Simpson Dominance Index, 1.5-fold greater Berger-Parker Dominance, and 2.9-fold lower Fisher's Alpha Diversity Index. When comparing isolate populations from field and short-term captive-housed fish, Sorenson's Similarity Coefficient (CC) was 0.081, and Jaccard's Distance Coefficient (1-J) was 0.958. Based upon these observations, our study provides clear evidence for the substantial and negative impact of short-term captive housing on F. heteroclitus gut flora diversity.

Study of the helminth fauna in eagle owl (<i>Bubo bubo</i>) in the south of Spain								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PARASITOLOGY-PARASITES AND WILDLIFE				18				260	265		10.1016/j.ijppaw.2022.06.011			AUG 2022	2022	In this study we show the results of the eagle owls' (Bubo bubo) helminthfauna found in Andalusia. A total number of 50 specimens have been analysed in a period of 10 years (from 2011 to 2020). Prevalence (P-%), mean intensity (I-M) and mean abundance (A(M)) of parasitation have been obtained. The percentage of parasitation in the total sample was 80% (40 out of 50 eagle owls): 78% nematodes, 8% trematodes, 6% cestodes and 4% acantocephalans. 7 species of helminths were identified: 6 nematodes, and 1 trematode. In the case of cestodes and acantocephalans it was not possible to determine species and only the genus was identified. The intestinal nematode Capillaria tenuissima (P-% = 58% (44-71.2); I-M = 11,52 (5.83-28.9)) was the core species whereas Synhimantus laticeps (P% = 16 (7.5-28.8); I-M = 4 (1.75-7.25)) and Hartertia hispanica (P% = 16 (7.5-28.8); I-M = 1,5 (1-2)) were the secondary species. The remainder species were considered satellite species, with low prevalence and average abundance. Likewise, descriptive parameters of the helminth community were determined: species richness, 1.56 (1.29-1.94), total abundance, 12 (7.24-26.40), Brillouin's diversity index, 0.18 (0.10-0.29) and Berger-Parker dominance index, 0.88 (0.81-0.93). The data from this study show a non-diverse helminthic community, without species dominance with C. tenuissima as the central species, followed by S. laticeps and H. hispanica as secondary species. Worth mentioning is the presence of H. hispanica, which is considered an endemic species in Spain and specifically in Andalusia. To the authors' knowledge, this is the largest population sample taken in parasitological studies about helminths of this raptor in Europe and the first one carried out in the south of Spain (Andalusia).

Macrofungal diversity and distribution in Kishtwar High Altitude National Park, Jammu and Kashmir, India								CURRENT SCIENCE				122	12			1415	1425					JUN 25 2022	2022	The present study was conducted at 10 sites in Kishtwar High Altitude National Park (KHANP), Jammu and Kashmir, India, with the objective to analyse the diversity and distribution of macrofungal communities. A total of 40 permanent plots (four plots in each site) were established and macrofungal fruiting bodies were recorded monthly from each plot between July 2015 and October 2017. Diversity indices and canonical correspondence analysis were applied to determine the composition and environmental factors responsible for structuring the macrofungal communities in the study area. In total, 83 wild macrofungal species were identified belonging to 35 genera, 24 families and 9 orders. Humicolous fungi were the most dominant group of macrofungi contributing 71.8% of the total dominance, followed by lignicolous fungi (11.8%). The distribution of fruiting bodies of macrofungal species was mainly in groups, i.e. aggregated pattern (75.9%). The diversity indices varied from 20 to 37 (richness), 2.04 to 3.16 (Menhinick), 4.14 to 7.25 (Margalef), 0.03 to 0.06 (Simpson's dominance), 2.91 to 3.49 (Shannon-Wiener's diversity), 0.86 to 0.95 (evenness), 7.69 to 16.29 (Fisher's alpha) and 0.05 to 0.12 (Berger-Parker diversity). Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that Scleroderma verrucosum, Boletus granulatus and Ramaria formosa were the most important species, and that mean temperature and rainfall were the key environmental factors responsible for the diversity and distribution of macrofungi in the present study.

Community functional composition (i.e., functional diversity and functional identity of community plant functional traits) is critical for community stability; however, this topic has received less attention in large-scale studies. Here, we combined a field survey of biodiversity and plant functional traits in 22 alpine grassland sites throughout the northern Tibetan Plateau with 20 years of satellite-sensed proxy data (enhanced vegetation index) of community productivity to identify the factors influencing community stability. Our results showed that functional composition influenced community stability the most, explaining 61.71% of the variation in community stability (of which functional diversity explained 18.56% and functional identity explained 43.15%), which was a higher contribution than that of biodiversity (BergerParker index and species evenness; 35.04%). Structural equation modeling suggested that functional identity strongly affected community stability, whereas biodiversity had a minor impact. Furthermore, functional identity of leaf dry matter content regulated community stability by enhancing species dominance (Berger-Parker index). Our findings demonstrate that functional composition, specifically functional identity, plays a key role in community stability, highlighting the importance of functional identity in understanding and revealing the stabilizing mechanisms in these fragile alpine ecosystems which are subjected to increasing environmental fluctuations.

Understanding the effects of grazing intensity, aridity, and soil microbes is required for sustainable management. Here, we focused on arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in soils and roots and examined their relationship with ecosystem multifunctionality under livestock grazing of Mongolian grasslands with different aridity levels. Above-and below-ground plant biomass were used to measure ecosystem-service multifunctionality, excluding annual plants that are unfavorable for ecosystem function and rangeland management. In both mountain forest steppe (mean annual precipitation = 207.7 mm) and steppe-desert steppe transition zone (mean annual precipitation = 128.4 mm), ecosystem multifunctionality was decreased by livestock grazing, as indicated by palatable plant shoot biomass. In line with the multifunctionality, the dominant plant species, Stipa krylovii, and AM plant biomass were decreased by livestock grazing. The Berger-Parker dominance index of soil AM fungi and Simpson's diversity had a positive and negative relationship with multifunctionality, respectively, indicating that dominant AM fungi rather than AM fungal diversity in soil are key for maintaining multifunctionality. Root and soil AM fungal communities were significantly different with dominance of Rhizophagus operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in roots and Claroideoglomus OTUs in soil. However, the similarity between soil and root AM fungal communities increased with livestock grazing. Correlation analysis between palatable plant biomass and relative abundance of dominant AM fungal OTUs identified indicator virtual taxa that decreased (VTX00325 in roots, and VTX00165, VTX00214, and VTX00222 in soil) or increased (VTX00100, VTX00130, and VTX00295 in soil) with grazing intensity. The OTUs that were increased by grazing may be r-selected, grazing-tolerant AM fungi that accept a low C supply and supply few nutrients to plants. Our results suggest that grassland management focusing on ecosystem-service multi functionality via control of AM plants, including S. krylovii and their co-dominant dominant AM fungi, in ungrazed grasslands are key for sustainable rangeland management in Mongolia.

These parasites can cause disease in these birds, whether farmed or free-living. The aim of this study was to describe the morphology of parasitic worms in the partridge, native to Poland, and the introduced pheasant, and to determine the level of infection of these birds with intestinal parasitic worms. The study showed that partridges are infected with several helminth species that had not previously been recorded in this species in Poland. Pheasants are more often infected by intestinal nematodes than are partridges. These worms can negatively affect the condition of partridges and increase their risk of infection with pathogenic protozoa. The results of parasitological examination should be used to develop programmes for diagnosis and monitoring of parasitic infections in order to keep flocks free of parasites. The aim of this study was to describe the morphology and means of identification of helminths in native partridges (65) and introduced pheasants (32) in Poland and to determine the level of intestinal infection of these birds by helminths using parasitological and ecological indices. The birds were acquired during the hunting season in the years 2015-2017. Nematodes, Capillaria phasianina, cestodes, Railietina friedbergeri, and one trematode, Brachylaima sp. were recorded for the first time in partridges in Poland. Our findings indicate that parasites are more prevalent in pheasants (prevalence 70.4%) than in partridges (prevalence 50.0%). The component community and infracommunity of parasites of partridges are more diverse (Simpson's diversity index: 0.63 and mean Brillouin diversity index: 0.10 +/- 0.17) and less dominated by a single parasite species (Capillaria sp., Berger-Parker dominance index: 0.53) than the pheasant parasite community (Simpson's diversity index: 0.07, mean Brillouin diversity index: 0.005 +/- 0.02, dominant species Heterakis gallinarum, Berger-Parker dominance index: 0.96). There were statistically significant differences between partridges and pheasants in the Brillouin diversity index and in the prevalence of Heterakis gallinarum (55.6% in pheasants vs. 19.0 in partridges). There were significant differences between wild and farmed partridges in the prevalence of infection by Capillaria sp. (4.3% vs. 37.5%) and H. gallinarum (39.1 vs. 6.2%). In conclusion, the pheasant was shown to be a reservoir, carrier, and shedder of nematodes, which may increase the risk of infection in partridges.

Diversity and composition of the spider fauna in a semideciduous Atlantic forest area in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil								STUDIES ON NEOTROPICAL FAUNA AND ENVIRONMENT				58	3			500	521		10.1080/01650521.2021.1993674			SEP 2 2023	2023	This spider survey of a semidecidual forest area in the city of Mendes, in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, aims to increase the scant knowledge about spider communities in this Brazilian ecosystem. Samples were taken over a year, once every three months, in four different sites with seven sampling methods. An overall of 457 species/morphoespecies were recorded in 47 families, corresponding to 10,541 individuals sampled. Families with highest number of species were Theridiidae (91), Araneidae (72), and Salticidae (55). Families with highest abundance were Theridiidae (2,829 specimens), Pholcidae (2,328), and Araneidae (1,263). Most abundant species were Mesabolivar togatus(534), Carapoia lutea(499 individuals), and Cryptachaea digitus (387). Species accumulation curves indicate a minimum of 513 (Bootstrap) and a maximum of 653 species (Jackknife2) for sampled areas. Total Berger-Parker dominance index was low, 0.051, varying from 0.042 to 0.076, while total Pielou equitability Index was high, 0.805, ranging from 0.744 to 0.800. Total Shannon-Wiener diversity index was relatively high, 4.931, ranging from 4.559 to 4.899. The complex, very diverse and relatively well-structured spider community found in Mendes is remarkable, especially in an area with predominantly secondary forests and high anthropic influence.

J	Wale, Melaku; Yesuf, Sofia								Abundance and diversity of soil arthropods in disturbed and undisturbed ecosystem in Western Amhara, Ethiopia								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE				42	1			767	781		10.1007/s42690-021-00600-w			FEB 2022	2022	Arthropods are indispensable because of their role in the food chain and in the recycling of ecosystem resources. The objective of the study was to assess the diversity and abundance of soil arthropods in selected habitats in northwestern Ethiopia. Soil arthropod taxa richness and abundance were estimated using transect sampling from January 2019 to May 2020. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, diversity indices, detrended correspondence analysis, and cluster analysis. A total of 5512 arthropods were found, i.e., 2585 macro- and 2927 micro-arthropods. Fifty-seven percent (3054) were found in the forest, 29% (1670) in the grassland and 14% (788) in the cultivated area. According to the Shannon-Weaver index, species diversity of soil macro-arthropods was higher in the forest and grassland (H ' > 2) habitats than the cultivated ((H ' < 2); Pielou's evenness showed that micro-arthropods were found to be more evenly distributed (J > 0.9) than macro-arthropods (J < 0.9). Macro-arthropods showed more Menhinick species richness (range: 0.37 to 0.63) than micro-arthropods (range: 0.13 to 0.24); Margalef index showed similar pattern. Berger-Parker dominance was higher on micro- (> 0.37) than macroarthropods (< 0.33). Macro-arthropods had higher Chao 1 index (12 to 14) than micro-arthropods (5). Number of soil arthropods varied significantly between habitats and between sampling dates (macro-arthropods: F = 16.5, df = 153,224, P < .0001; micro-arthropods: F = 15.7, df = 54, 80, P < .0001). The detrended correspondence analysis showed relationships between habitats and soil arthropods (e.g., wasps were relatively more associated with the forest habitat), and the cluster analysis grouped the different soil arthropods based on their degree of similarity in abundance (e.g., ants and termites stood out clearly separated). Biomass and soil moisture content was relatively less in March. The present study confirmed that soil arthropods thrived generally more abundantly in undisturbed habitats (forests) than in cultivated and grasslands. This implies the need to step up conservation schemes in more representative sites in this ecosystem.

J	Kide, Saikou Oumar; Mante, Claude; Demarcq, Herve; Merigot, Bastien								Groundfish assemblages diversity in upwelling ecosystems: insights from the Mauritanian Exclusive Economic Zone								BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				30	8-9			2279	2304		10.1007/s10531-021-02189-5			JUL 2021	2021	Upwelling ecosystems exhibit strong spatio-temporal variations of environmental conditions that drive the dynamics of marine diversity and ressources. Yet little is known in these ecosystems concerning the diversity of groundfishes. We studied the effects of environment (sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration and bathymetric strata) and fishing pressure on this variability in the Mauritanian Exclusive Economic Zone (MEEZ), based on abundance data collected from 2158 hauls from scientific surveys performed on the continental shelf (15-200 m) between 1997 and 2010. First, for each haul (i.e. alpha-diversity), Species richness S and Berger Parker dominance D-bp were used as proxies of two complementary groups of nine indices, belonging to three main components of diversity (species number, evenness and taxonomic diversity), identified by a principal component analysis based on Spearman correlation coefficient. Thus the set of diversity indices used in this work suggests that a single component of diversity cannot represent the biodiversity of MEEZ groundfish. Second, generalized linear models (GLM) highlighted the stability of both indices for environmental variables, fishing effort and time, while, as shown by a previous study in the MEEZ, these variables influence species composition (i.e. beta-diversity). A longitudinal gradient of S and D-bp was highlighted, with coastal strata being richer in species and abundances more evenly distributed among species than offshore strata. Overall, this study provides a baseline of groundfish diversity in the MEEZ, that is also useful for comparison to other upwelling ecosystems, and essential for monitoring its potential shifts faced to climate change.

It is a relatively rare fish species; therefore, published data on the parasite communities of P. charcoti are limited. The present study was performed on the Ukrainian Antarctic Station "Akademik Vernadsky", Argentine Islands, West Antarctica and the purpose was to examine the species diversity of the parasites of P. charcoti and to identify the parameters of helminth infection and helminth component community. Methods Fifteen specimens of P. charcoti were caught at a depth of 10-30 m and examined using standard parasitological techniques. All helminths (6251 specimens) were collected manually, fixed in 70% ethanol and identified based on their morphology. Results All examined specimens of P. charcoti were found to be infected with helminths; each fish harboured 10-20 helminth species (mean 13.2; median 13) and 237-804 helminth specimens (mean 417; median 401). Twenty-seven helminth species were found, including nine species of trematodes, 4 of cestodes, 4 of nematodes and 10 of acanthocephalans. P. charcoti is the definitive host for 11 out of 27 helminth species recorded. In the helminth component community, the diversity indices were 2.03 (Shannon's index) and 0.79 (Simpson's index); Pielou evenness index was 0.61, and Berger-Parker dominance index was 0.38. Conclusions Our results indicate a high species diversity and complex structure of the helminth community in Antarctic dragonfish P. charcoti in the Argentine Islands.

A case study of insect visitors and pollen vectors in sponge gourd (<i>Luffa cylindrica</i> (Linn.)) during summer and rainy seasons in India								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE				42	1			215	225		10.1007/s42690-021-00535-2			FEB 2022	2022	Insect crop visitations do not necessarily always translate to transfer or carriage of pollen. To determine the potential of the various insects visiting summer and rainy seasons sponge gourd (Luffa cylindrica (Linn.)) flowers to facilitate the pollen transfer, the present study examines the diversity of visiting insects to sponge gourd seed crops in relation to the time of day and season, diversity and abundance to its flowers, fruits and seed yield. These visiting insects taxonomically belonged to 8 different insect orders viz. Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, Neuroptera, Lepidoptera, Odonata and Orthoptera/Dictyoptera. Rainy season sponge gourd crops had higher numbers of insect visitors and higher diversity (0.80 of Simpson's Diversity Index and 1.71 of Shannon-Weaver Index of diversity as compared to summer season crop (0.72 and 1.51, respectively). The summer crop had the highest number of visiting insects belonged to the order Coleoptera followed by Hemiptera and Hymenoptera and their reciprocal form of Berger Parker's dominance indices were 2.21, 5.05 and 6.17, respectively. In summer crop, honeybees were the main pollinators comprising 57.69% of total pollinators in sponge gourds. All the four honeybee species viz., Apis cerana indica, A. dorsata, A. florea and A. mellifera were found to visit in sponge gourd. However, the dominant species was A. florea with 39% of total honeybee share. In rainy season crop, in contrary, honeybees comprised only 16.32% share on total visiting pollinators in sponge gourd. Rice skipper, Pelopidas mathias (46.84% share) was found almost thorough out the day with higher visitation during evening hours. Other pollinators were stingless bees (11.58% share), butterflies and moths. Consequently, we suggest optimizing pollinators' management including honeybees and thereby improving the attraction of sponge gourd lines to these pollinators to improve pollination rates for sponge gourd seed crops.

J	Feng, Guang; Huang, Jihong; Xu, Yue; Li, Junqing; Zang, Runguo								Disentangling Environmental Effects on the Tree Species Abundance Distribution and Richness in a Subtropical Forest								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				12						622043	10.3389/fpls.2021.622043			MAR 22 2021	2021	As a transitional vegetation type between evergreen broadleaved forest and deciduous broadleaved forest, evergreen-deciduous broadleaved mixed forest is composed of diverse plant species. This distinctive forest is generally distributed in mountainous areas with complex landforms and heterogeneous microenvironments. However, little is known about the roles of environmental conditions in driving the species diversity patterns of this forest. Here, based on a 15-ha plot in central China, we aimed to understand how and to what extent topographical characteristics and soil nutrients regulate the number and relative abundance of tree species in this forest. We measured environmental factors (terrain convexity, slope, soil total nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations) and species diversity (species abundance distribution and species richness) in 20 m x 20 m subplots. Species abundance distribution was characterized by skewness, Berger-Parker index, and the proportion of singletons. The generalized additive model was used to examine the variations in diversity patterns caused by environmental factors. The structural equation model was used to assess whether and how topographical characteristics regulate species diversity via soil nutrients. We found that soil nutrients had significant negative effects on species richness and positive effects on all metrics of species abundance distribution. Convexity had significant positive effects on species richness and negative effects on all metrics of species abundance distribution, but these effects were mostly mediated by soil nutrients. Slope had significant negative effects on skewness and the Berger-Parker index, and these effects were almost independent of soil nutrients. Soil nutrients and topographical characteristics together accounted for 9.5-17.1% of variations in diversity patterns and, respectively, accounted for 8.9-13.9% and 3.3-10.7% of the variations. We concluded that soil nutrients were more important than topographical factors in regulating species diversity. Increased soil nutrient concentration led to decreased taxonomic diversity and increased species dominance and rarity. Convexity could be a better proxy for soil nutrients than slope. Moreover, these abiotic factors played limited roles in regulating diversity patterns, and it is possible that the observed patterns are also driven by some biotic and abiotic factors not considered here.

In the current study, we compare and evaluate performance of different diversity measures, i.e., commonly used simple diversity indices vs. novel complex measures incorporating ecological information of species (feeding behavior and stream zonation preferences). As a target group, we chose caddisflies, a species-rich, aquatic insect order, in different habitats of an anthropogenically unimpacted, connected karst barrage lake/riverine system. In line with our hypothesis, the complex diversity measures were more efficient in ranking and distinguishing different habitats, particularly the ones with similar communities. We also constructed a novel measure to rank the habitats by sensitivity to climate change, based on diversity of caddisfly communities and vulnerability of species inhabiting them. As expected, the springs were ranked as most vulnerable habitats. Our study further underlines the importance of integrating ecological information into biodiversity and vulnerability assessment of freshwater communities. Freshwater biodiversity is facing a severe crisis due to many human impacts, yet the diversity dynamics of freshwater communities and possibilities of assessing these are vastly unexplored. We aimed at emphasizing different aspects of portraying diversity of a species-rich, aquatic insect group (caddisflies; Trichoptera) across four different habitats in an anthropogenically unimpacted, connected karst barrage lake/riverine system. To define diversity, we used common indices with pre-set sensitivity to species abundance/dominance; i.e., sensitivity parameter (species richness, Shannon, Simpson, Berger-Parker) and diversity profiles based on continuous gradients of this sensitivity parameter: the naive and non-naive diversity profiles developed by Leinster and Cobbold. The non-naive diversity profiles show diversity profiles with regard to the similarity among species in terms of ecological traits and preferences, whereas the naive diversity profile is called mathematically "naive" as it assumes absolute dissimilarity between species that is almost never true. The commonly used indices and the naive diversity profile both ranked the springs as least diverse and tufa barriers as most diverse. The non-naive diversity profiles based on similarity matrices (using feeding behavior and stream zonation preferences of species), showed even greater differences between these habitats, while ranking stream habitats close together, regardless of their longitudinal position. We constructed the Climate Score index (CSI) in order to assess how diversity and species' vulnerability project the community's resistance and/or resilience to climate change. The CSI ranked the springs as most vulnerable, followed by all habitats longitudinally placed below them. We highlight the importance of integrating ecological information into biodiversity and vulnerability assessment of freshwater communities.

The sputum microbiome, airway inflammation, and mortality in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease								JOURNAL OF ALLERGY AND CLINICAL IMMUNOLOGY				147	1			158	167		10.1016/j.jaci.2020.02.040			JAN 2021	2021	Background: The sputum microbiome has a potential role in disease phenotyping and risk stratification in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), but few large longitudinal cohort studies exist. Objective: Our aim was to investigate the COPD sputum microbiome and its association with inflammatory phenotypes and mortality. Methods: 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing was performed on sputum from 253 clinically stable COPD patients (4-year median follow-up). Samples were classified as Proteobacteria or Firmicutes (phylum level) and Haemophilus or Streptococcus (genus level) dominant. Alpha diversity was measured by using Shannon-Wiener diversity and Berger-Parker dominance indices. Survival was modeled by using Cox proportional hazards regression. A subset of 78 patients had label-free liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry performed, with partial least square discriminant analysis integrating clinical, microbiome, and proteomics data. Results: Proteobacteria dominance and lower diversity was associated with more severe COPD according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease classification system (P = .0015), more frequent exacerbations (P = .0042), blood eosinophil level less than or equal to 100 cells/ILL (P < .0001), and lower FEV1 (P = .026). Blood eosinophil counts showed a positive relationship with percent of Firmicutes and Streptococcus and a negative association with percent Proteobacteria and Haemophilus. Proteobacteria dominance was associated with increased mortality compared with Firmicutes-dominated or balanced microbiome profiles (hazard ratio = 2.58; 95% CI = 1.43-4.66; P = .0017 and hazard ratio = 7.47; 95% CI = 1.02-54.86; P = .048, respectively). Integrated omics analysis showed significant associations between Proteobacteria dominance and the neutrophil activation pathway in sputum. Conclusion: The sputum microbiome is associated with clinical and inflammatory phenotypes in COPD. Reduced microbiome diversity, associated with Proteobacteria (predominantly Haemophilus) dominance, is associated with neutrophilassociated protein profiles and an increased risk of mortality.

Assessment of woody species diversity and composition along a disturbance gradient in Behali Reserve Forest of Biswanath district, Assam, India								ECOLOGICAL QUESTIONS				32	1						10.12775/EQ.2021.009			2021	2021	The present study was carried out in Behali Reserve Forest, a semi-evergreen forest of Assam, India to record and analyze the woody species diversity and community characteristics using random sampling. Altogether, 35 quadrats (20 m x 20 m) were randomly established and studied from August 2018 to April 2019 spreading across nine study sites. A total of 128 (118 identified and 10 unidentified) woody species from 83 genera and 43 families were found in the sampled area of 1.4 ha. Lauraceae with 19 species was the richest family by species followed by Euphorbiaceae and Phyllanthaceae (eight species each). Altogether, 787 individuals were recorded from the sampled plots and the stand density ranged between 250 individuals x ha(-1) to 725 individuals x ha(-1) with mean stand density of 543 individuals x ha(-1). Species-wise density analysis revealed that Magnolia hodgsonii (96.43 individuals x ha(-1)) has the maximum tree density. Plot wise analysis showed that Dikal (58.32 m(2) x ha(-1)) recorded the maximum basal area as well as the equitability index of 0.95. In Serelia, we recorded the highest Simpson index (0.92), Shannon H index (2.76), Brillouin index (2.11), Menhinick (3.49), Margalef (5.29) and Fisher alpha index (26.59). In Radhasu, we recorded maximum evenness (0.90), dominance (0.58) and Berger-Parker index (0.65). The maximal values of Chao index (38.53) was recorded in Hatimara. Our study also revealed that diversity was maximal for the community under medium level of disturbance in the reserve, while communities under the lowest and highest disturbance pressure had minimal diversity. The Behali Reserve Forest exhibited a great species richness (118 species), mean basal area (44.42 m(2) x ha(-1)) and stand density (in total, 788 individuals per study area of 1.4 ha) compared to the other forests of the northeastern region of India.

Fourteen species of helminths were found in 6 rodent assemblages. Five new hosts and 12 new geographical reports from Humid Chaco ecoregion are provided. The higher prevalence values corresponded to Stilestrongylus stilesi, Hassalstrongylus mazzai, H. argentinus and Mazzanema fortuita, and the higher mean abundance and mean intensity values corresponded to S. stilesi from Necromys lasiurus. Nippostrongylinae was the dominant group within each host species. The ecological descriptors of component communities are given. The highest value of richness index was observed for N. lasiurus (S = 6). The diversity index reached values between the range 1.11 in Holochilus chacarius and 0.16 in Akodon azarae. The equitability index shows the highest values for Oligoryzomys flavescens (0.96) and H. chacarius (0.81). The highest value index of dominance of Berger-Parker was observed for A. azarae (0.96) followed by N. lasiurus (0.86). This study contributes to the taxonomic and ecological of the parasite-host relationships, providing substantial information to one of the ecoregions most affected by anthropic actions in Argentina.

Soil microbes play important roles in soil fertility. Microbes are sensitive to changes in agricultural activities occurring in the soil, thus they can be used as an indicator for soil quality. This study was conducted to analyse soil microbial biodiversity at logged over forest on mineral soil before development to oil palm plantation, by using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis combined with 16S rDNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR-DGGE). The average number of bands from PCR-DGGE profiles indicated strip 2 was significantly less diversified than the rest of the sites at alpha=0.05. Shannon-Weaver biodiversity index and Berger-Parker Dominance Index, showed highest diversity in area cultivable for oil palm, followed by the biodiversity strip areas. Bacterial communities were dominated by unclassified bacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria and alpha-Proteobacteria groups in all types of forest soils. Acidobacteria group was absent in strip 3 where the soil pH was least acidic. Common species found for all sites were, uncultured Acidobacteria bacterium (Acidobacteria), uncultured Actinobacterium clones (Actinobacteria) and uncultured Rhodoplanes sp. (alpha-Proteobacteria).

We determined the trematode fauna of juvenile and adult Mallards from Poland in 2010-16 (n=79 Mallards) and from the Czech Republic in 1964-2001 (n=296). Infracommunity diversity of trematodes from juvenile Mallards, defined by the Brillouin index and mean number of species, was significantly greater in Poland than it was in the Czech Republic. There were more species and greater biodiversity in the trematode communities of Mallards from Poland, where the environment is more natural and less altered by human activity than it is in the Czech Republic. In the trematode community of juvenile Mallards, the Simpson's index of biodiversity was higher in the Czech Republic than it was in Poland. The Berger-Parker dominance index was comparable in both countries. In terms of prevalence, the structure of the trematode fauna was hierarchic, and trematode species had different positions in this hierarchy in the two countries. Statistically significant differences in the epidemiologic indices between infection of juvenile Mallards from Poland and the Czech Republic were noted for Bilharziella polonica, Echinostoma miyagawai, Echinostoma revolutum, Prosthogonimus cuneatus, Prostlwgonimus ovatus, Notocotylus attenuatus, Echinoparyphium recurvatum, Australapatemon minor, Apatemon gracihs, Cyathocotyle prussica, Hypoderaeum conoideum, Metorchis xanthosomus, Psilochasmus oxyurus, and Cotylurus cornutus.

Development and structure of phytoplankton in the middle part of Kremenchug reservoir								UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				10	4			132	136		10.15421/2020_180			2020	2020	An analysis of quantitative and qualitative composition of phytoplankton in the middle part of the Kremenchug reservoir in the water area near the village of Chervona Sloboda, the village of Lesky and the village of Khudyaki in August 2016 is presented. The peculiarities of its formation in this period are established, and the changes that took place in the structure of its grouping are determined. The phytoplankton values of the Kremenchug reservoir were at the level of the total number of 16.8-54.0 million cells/dm(3), the total biomass of 2.3-4.9 mg/dm(3) and tended to develop in previous years. The basis of phytoplankton was formed by three groups of algae: Chlorophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cyanophyta. Green algae (class Chlorophyta) developed the least: their share was 3.1-28.8% of the total. The most represented species were Volvox aureus Ehr., Micractinium pusillum Fresen., Pandorina morum (O. Mull.) Bory and Chlamydomonas reinchardtii Dang. Diatoms algae (class Bacillariophyta) accounted for 19.2-62.4% of the total biomass, which was quite important in the formation of phytoplankton. Our data shows that Melosira granulata (Ehr.) Ralfs, M. angustissima Neizvestnova-Zhadina, Nitzschia acicularis (Kutz.) W. SmITH. prevailed among diatoms in all three studied areas. Blue-green algae (class Cyanophyta) predominated at all sampling stations No 1, 2, and 3, amounting to 26.0-93.7% and formed the basis of the phytoplankton community. In this group of algae the most represented species were: Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (L.) Ralfs ex Bornet & Flahault, Anabaena flos-aquae (L.) Bory, Microcystis aeruginosa Kutzing, (station No 1 and 2), An. flos-aquae, M. aeruginosa (station No 3). Calculation of the Berger-Parker dominance index showed that at all sampling stations the highest rates had only alga M. aeruginosa. Its dominant role gradually decreased along the Dnieper: D-BP = 0.83, 0.53, and 0.41 at sampling stations No 1, 2, and 3, respectively. As a result of intensive development of colonial alga M. aeruginosa, it acquired the status of absolute dominant and subdominant species in the structure of this phytoplankto.enosis. Thus, cyanobacteria have become the dominant group of photosynthetic organisms of this phytoplanktocenosis. In such a way occurs the succession of diffuse nature of regressive type towards the monodominance of the community, which threatens the balance of this hydroecosystem in general.

The article presents, for the first time, the results of a study of necrophilous beetles on the territory of the natural monument "The confluence of the Biya and Katun rivers (Ikonnikov Island)". The collection of the material was carried out using soil baited pitfall traps. There were discovered 64 species from 7 families of Coleoptera. The most abundant in species was Staphylinidae (43.77% of the total number of species). Families Silphidae and Histeridae have significantly less number of species (20.31% and 12.5% respectively), as well as other families (Scarabaeidae, Leiodidae, Dermestidae, Hydrophilidae), which were represented by 3-5 species each. The most abundant in the number of specimens was Silphidae (Nicrophorus vespillo, N. vespilloides, Oiceoptoma thoracicum). Common and numerous were Anoplotrupes stercorosus, Aphodius rectus (Scarabaeidae), Sciodrepoides watsoni (Leiodidae), Hister unicolor, Saprinus semistriatus (Histeridae), Creophylus maxilosus (Staphylinidae). The estimation of the species richness, degree of dominance and evenness of species in the community of necrophilous Coleoptera showed medium values of Shannon index (H=2.6), Berger-Parker index (D=0.26) and Pielou's evenness index (E=0.44).

In the protected wetlands of Humedales de Santa Lucia in the Montevideo Department, we made monthly surveys from December 2012 to March 2013. Sampling was conducted with entomological nets and by hand. We collected 1216 individuals of 26 different species belonging to seven subfamilies. Gomphocerinae and Melanoplinae were the most abundant, accounting for 71% and 16% of the individuals respectively. The Shannon index showed a medium diversity, but the Berger-Parker dominance index and Pielou equitativity index indicate a slight dominance of the acridomorph community studied. This is probably because five species accounted for 87% of the individuals collected. Although our results are similar to previous studies of acridomorph communities in grasslands of the region, our study, the first of this kind for this ecosystem in Uruguay, will be important for the conservation of this protected area.

A total of 8,774 parasites representing 9 species and 22,765 parasites representing 12 species was collected in 2011 and 2016 respectively, but only 42.8% of the species were common to both study years. In both years, there was a dominance of Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and the component community was 51% dissimilar. The species richness of parasites and the Berger-Parker dominance were higher in 2016, while the evenness and Brillouin diversity were higher in 2011. The prevalence and abundance of I. multifiliis and P. pillulare, as well as the prevalence of Contracaecum sp. were higher in the rainy season. The abundance of Anacanthorus strongylophalus, Urocleidoides sp., Dadayus pacupeva and Dadaytrema oxycephala was higher in the dry season. Infection with Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus was not influenced by the season, while by Trichodina sp. occurred only in the dry season and Ergasilus xinguensis only in the rainy season. The species richness of parasites, Brillouin diversity index and evenness were higher in the dry season, while the Berger-Parker index was higher in the rainy season. Temporal variation of communities and infracommunities of parasites was influenced by the body size of host populations and increase in anthropogenic impacts. Effect of seasons on environmental quality, host size and availability of infective stages of parasites were the determining factors in structuring the component communities and infracommunities of parasites.

Methods: The reported HFMD cases were collected in Changsha from 2009 to 2017. The traditional descriptive method and a new method (index system) including six indices (richness index N, Simpson diversity index D, Shannon diversity index H, Berger-Parker dominance index d, Shannon evenness index E, and Morisita?Horn similarity index C) were used to describe the epidemiological characteristics of HFMD in Changsha. Results: There were 214155 HFMD reported in Changsha during the study period. The incidence of the disease was higher in even-numbered years (2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016) than in uneven-numbered years (2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017), with two peaks in May to June and October to November every year. The age of onset was mainly from 0 to 5?years old, and the death was mainly from 0 to 2?years old. According to occupational classification, districts and counties (cities) had a high degree of similarity of the composition of HFMD, and there was no regional difference. Conclusions: Changsha had a yearly increasing trend of HFMD from 2009 to 2017, and the key population for prevention and control was children aged in 0?5?years old.

J	Zhou, Yi; Su, Yuqiao; Zhong, Yonglin; Xie, Peiyun; Xu, Mingfeng; Su, Zhiyao								Community Attributes Predict the Relationship between Habitat Invasibility and Land Use Types in an Agricultural and Forest Landscape								FORESTS				10	10					867	10.3390/f10100867			OCT 2019	2019	Finding ecosystem or community level indicators for habitat invasibility may provide natural resource managers with environmentally friendly measures to control alien plant invasion; yet, ecosystem invasibility remains understudied. Here, we investigated alien plant invasion into various ecosystems representing different land use types in a subtropical peri-urban area of south China. Four invasive alien species were found from five out of the six ecosystems. Lower plant diversity in both the overstory and understory was consistently associated with more severe alien plant invasion to the ecosystems. The highest total abundance and plot occurrence of the invasive plants were found in the agroforestry ecosystem representing the highest disturbance. At plot scale, an increase in invasion severity was associated with a significant decrease in overstory stem density, species richness, and diversity, but with a significant increase in overstory plant dominance. The understory community attributes in response to the increase in invasion severity followed similar patterns, except that the stem density increased with invasion severity. Higher canopy openness and thus lower leaf area index and greater understory radiation were associated with higher invasion severity of invasive plants to the understory habitat. For predicting total abundance of the invasive species, the most important variable is land use type, while for the abundance of Lantana camara and Mikania micrantha, the most important predictor variable is overstory Berger-Parker index and canopy openness, respectively. Canopy structure and understory gap light regimes were among the most important factors determining the abundance of the worst invasive plant Mikania micrantha. Our results demonstrate that land use types with varying disturbance regimes determine the spatial heterogeneity in plant diversity and community structure, which predicts alien plant invasion and habitat invasibility; and that the severity of alien plant invasion in turn is a good indicator of habitat disturbance across the ecosystems.

We investigated the influence of interannual variation and seasonality on the community structure and infracommunities of parasites in Hemibrycon surinamensis in a tributary of the Amazon River, in northern Brazil. Materials and methods The fish were examined for the presence of ectoparasites and endoparasites. Results In 2011, 9 parasite species were found (2 Protozoa, 2 Monogenea, 1 Digenea, 2 Nematoda and 2 Crustacea), and in 2016, 10 parasite species (3 Protozoa, 2 Monogenea, 1 Digenea, 3 Nematoda and 1 Pentastomida). No qualitative or quantitative dissimilarity in the component communities of parasites was observed between 2011 and 2016, but Brillouin Diversity Index, species richness and evenness were higher in 2016, while Berger-Parker dominance was higher in 2011. In both years, Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and Piscinoodinium pillulare were predominated. Some few species of parasites had interannual (P. pillulare and Genarchella genarchella) and seasonal (Trichodina sp., I. multifiliis, P. pillulare and J. hexops) variation patterns. Species richness of parasites was higher in the dry season, but Brillouin diversity, evenness and Berger-Parker dominance were similar between the seasons. Such seasonal variations were due to the host's the availability of infectious stages of parasites with direct life cycle. Conclusions Variations due to seasonal dry/rainy cycle, which influenced the availability of infective stages of parasites, and host size are the factors causing the changes interannual.

Methods 16S amplicon sequencing was used to analyse a total of 56 patients; 19 samples of carious dentin (pooled from at least three teeth) and 37 supragingival samples (pooled from three healthy tooth surfaces). Oral and periodontal status and socio-demographic parameters were recorded. Group assignment, smoking and further socio-demographic parameters were used as explanatory variables in the microbiome composition analysis. Results Overall, a total of 4,110,020 DNA high-quality sequences were yielded. Using a threshold of similarity >97% for assigning operational taxonomic units (OTU), a total of 1,537 OTUs were identified. PERMANOVA showed significant differences in microbiome composition between the groups caries/healthy (p = 0.001), smoking/non-smoking (p = 0.007) and fluoride intake during childhood yes/no (tablets p = 0.003, salt p = 0.023). The healthy microbiome had a significantly higher diversity (alpha diversity, p < 0.001) and a lower dominance (Berger-Parker index, p< 0.001). It was dominated by Fusobacteria. A linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) yielded a set of 39 OTUs being more abundant in carious dentin samples, including Atopobium spp. (14.9 log2FoldChange), Lactobacillus casei (11.6), Acinetobacter spp. (10.8), Lactobacillus gasseri (10.6), Parascardovia denticolens (10.5), Olsenella profusa (10.4), and others. Also Propionibacterium acidifaciens (7.2) and Streptococcus mutans (5.2) were overabundant in caries lesions. Conclusions The healthy microbiome was highly diverse. The advanced caries microbiome was dominated by a set of carious associated bacteria where S. mutans played only a minor role. Smoking and fluoride intake during childhood influenced the microbiome composition significantly. Clinical significance The presented investigation adds knowledge to the still not fully comprehended patterns of oral microbiomes in caries compared with oral health. By analysing the genetics of biofilm samples from oral health and severe tooth decay we found distinct discriminating species which could be targets for future therapeutic approaches.

Once the farms were selected, the fruit species were classified and floristic lists were prepared and used to determine the composition. Diversity alpha (alpha) was evaluated the Species Richness (S), Dominance of Berger-Parker (d) and General Diversity (Shannon H') while diversity of beta (beta) Sorenson similarity index (Iss) was taken into account. For the distribution, a bibliographic analysis was carried out identifying the main ranges of distribution in relation to Cuba. The composition of the fruit species had a fairly stable behavior from one period to the other always with a slight tendency to decrease although, by farms, an increase was experienced. Only the Anacardiaceous family has good representativeness in both periods with at least one species sampled and present in 100 % of the farms. The diversity a showed an increase with the arrival of the rain, however, the species classified as scarce predominated. The diversity beta showed a predominant of law similitude among the compared samples. The fruit trees of these farms are mostly exotic species and grown in Cuba that have a high invasive potential and in more than 60 % are considered low-fruity.

Interactive influence of rainfall manipulation and livestock grazing on species diversity of the herbaceous layer community in a humid savannah in Kenya								PLANT DIVERSITY				41	3			198	205		10.1016/j.pld.2019.04.005			JUN 2019	2019	Changes in rainfall regime and grazing pressure affect vegetation composition and diversity with ecological implications for savannahs. The savannah in East Africa has experienced increased livestock grazing and rainfall variability but the impacts associated with those changes on the herbaceous layer have rarely been documented. We investigated the effect of livestock grazing, rainfall manipulation and their interaction on the composition and diversity of the herbaceous community in the savannah for two years in Lambwe, Kenya. Rainfall manipulation plots were set up for vegetation sampling; these plots received either 50% more or 50% less rainfall than control plots. Simpson's diversity and Berger-Parker indices were used to determine diversity changes and dominance respectively. The frequency of species was used to compute their abundance and their life forms as determined from the literature. Grazing significantly increased species diversity through suppression of dominant species. Rainfall manipulation had no significant impact on plant diversity in fenced plots, but rainfall reduction significantly reduced diversity in grazed plots. In contrast, rainfall manipulation had no impact on dominance in either fenced or grazed plots. The interaction of grazing and rainfall manipulation is complex and will require additional survey campaigns to create a complete picture of the implications for savannah structure and composition.

They participate in all the categories of services provided by ecosystems. In agricultural areas, the conventional intensive farming practices have led to a significant decline in the biological diversity of soils including earthworms. In this study, we attempted to characterize the community structure of earthworms in permanent grassland and amble land of the Didactic & Experimental Station of Rzeszow University in Krasne near Rzeszow. Similar densities of earthworms were observed in the grassland and in the amble land (101.01 +/- 18.03 ind. . m(-)(2) and 82.12 +/- 18.26 ind. . m(-2), respectively) (p > 0.05) as well as a similar biomass of Lumbricidae (77.72 +/- 15.30 g . m(-2) and 54.34 +/- 11.72 g . m(-2)) (p > 0.05). In the research, 7 species of earthworms were found in the permanent grassland and 6 representatives of Lumbricidac were identified in the arable land. The identified earthworms represented all three main morpho-ecological groups. The density and biomass of epi-endogeic earthworm L. rubellus and the anecic species of L. terrestris were shown to be higher (p < 0.05) in the grassland as compared to the amble land. In order to protect Lumbricidae and to sustain the beneficial role of earthworms in an ecosystem, it is necessary to monitor the negative changes in populations of earthworm species attributed to various farming practices.

We investigated how tenebrionid community structure varied along a vegetational gradient in the Ulan Buh Desert (Gobi Desert). Sampling was done with pitfall traps in three sites with different vegetation cover. Species abundance distributions were fitted by the geometric series model, which expresses the "niche pre-emption" hypothesis. Community structure was investigated using different measures of diversity (number of species, Margaleff richness and Shannon-Weaner index), dominance (Simpson and Berger-Parker indexes) and evenness (Pielou's index). The observed tenebrionid species richness was similar to that known from other Gobi Desert sites. The three investigated sites have similar species-abundance patterns, but the most dominant species varied among them. This suggests that the local environment operates a filtering action on the same basic fauna, allowing different species to dominate under different conditions. Overall, the highest total abundance was observed in the true desert site, however this site had a community structure similar to that observed in the site with more vegetation. By contrast, the investigated site with intermediate conditions showed a higher diversity and evenness, and a lower dominance. Thus, intermediate conditions of plant cover favour tenebrionid diversity, whereas a dense cover or a very sparse cover increases the dominance.

In January 2017, 31 specimens of A. tetramerus were collected and they were necropsied using usual methodologies for parasitology of fish. A total of 1,181 parasites were collect and 100% of hosts were parasitized by Gussevia disparoides, Gussevia alioides, Posthodiplostomum sp., Clinostomum sp., Dolops longicauda and Acarina gen. sp. The dominance was of G. disparoides and there was aggregated dispersion of G. disparoides, Posthodiplostomum sp. and Clinostomum sp., while the dispersion of G. alioides, D. longicauda and Acarina gen. sp was random. There were low species richness of parasites (2.45 +/- 0.68), low Brillouin diversity index (0.52 +/- 0.22), evenness (0.37 +/- 0.15) and high Berger-Parker dominance (0.70 +/- 0.15). The parasites community was characterized by low richness of species with high prevalence and low parasitic abundance. Host length had little influence on the abundance of parasites, but host behavior and availability of infective stages of parasites were the factors structuring the parasite community in A. tetramerus. This was the first study on parasites of A. tetramerus from the Jari River basin.

Specimens were collected from eight EUNIS (European Nature Information System) habitats, using pitfall and bait traps. In addition, bottoms of rocks or tree logs that were partially or completely decayed as well as underneath the barks and inner or underneath of cattle dung were searched. A total of 1733 specimens of the three subfamilies were collected and a total of 85 species were identified. These were 12 species of the Steninae, 50 species of the Staphylininae and 23 species of the Paederinae. Based on the present results, it was possible to add new habitat data for some species. The highest number of species (67) was found in C3.6 (Unvegetated or sparsely vegetated shores with soft or mobile sediments), followed by G1.7 (Thermophilous deciduous woodland, 40 species). In contrast, 11.1 (Intensive unmixed crops) habitat had the lowest number of species (ten). The diversity and richness of species components were analysed using Shannon's, Berger-Parker's and Simpson's indices, k-dominance and rarefaction curve. Based on these analyses, C3.6 habitat had the highest diversity values. Considering similarity percentages, G1.7 and G3.5 (Pinus nigra woodland) had the highest similarity percentage (50.76%). These are the first data on richness, abundance and diversity of the Staphylinidae (Steninae, Staphylininae and Paederinae) in Turkey. The present results have established the baseline for further analyses of the richness and diversity of the Staphylinidae in the region.

Altogether 3,328 individuals were observed. Out of 35 Families, Sturnidae and Sylviidae had the highest number of species (5 species each). Six simple dietary guilds were observed during the present study; the maximum number of species belonged to insectivore group and minimum to nectarivore. Analysis of data revealed that the average of species diversity index of the avian community (H') during the study period was 3.88. Using the Berger-Parker dominance value, we found the most abundant species was House sparrow (Passer domesticus), followed by Oriental turtle dove (Streptopelia orientalis), Peaceful Dove (Geopelia striata), Common Myna (Acridotheres tristis) and Red collared dove (Streptopelia tranquebarica). The threatened status of birds given in the checklist is as per IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2017. The presence of Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria) in the study, listed under the category 'Near Threatened' in the IUCN Red List, is a matter of concern. The findings of the present study would provide the baseline information about the composition of the avian community and its distribution in the Suranaree University of Technology, which is an important ecosystem for the conservation of avian biodiversity. Many other areas adjacent to the campus also require attention for the inventory of avian communities. Therefore, a long-term database on exhaustive and intensive study of the North East Thailand is required.

We collected a total of 4966 parasites from 34 fishes, including monogeneans (Anacanthorus spatbulatus, Mymarothecium boegeri, Notozothecium janauachensis and Linguadactyloides brinkmanni), nematodes (Spectatus spectatus larvae, Contracaecum sp. larvae and Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus), digeneans (Cladorchiidae metacercariae), acanthocephalans (Neoechinorhynchus buttnerae), crustaceans (Ergasilus turucuyus, Argulus multicolor, Perulernaea gamitanae and Bragapatagonica), mites and leeches. The dominance was of monogenean species, found in the gills of the hosts. The parasites exhibited high aggregate dispersion, except Contracaecum. sp. and P. (S.) inopinatus, that showed uniform and random dispersion, respectively. The species richness of parasites varied from 1 to 9, the Brillouin diversity index from 0 to 1.52, evenness from 0 to 0.63 and the Berger-Parker dominance index from 0.39 to 1.00. Abundance of parasites was not influenced by host length, but there was significant correlation with host body weight in some cases. The parasite community was characterized by low species richness and moderate diversity, with a predominance of ectoparasites with high prevalence and abundance, as well as the presence of endoparasites in the larval stage.

Metrics derived from fish assemblages as indicators of environmental degradation in Cerrado streams								ZOOLOGIA				35						e12895	10.3897/zoologia.35.e12895			2018	2018	The development of effective monitoring tools depends on finding sensitive metrics that are capable of detecting the most important environmental impacts at a given region. We assessed if metrics derived from stream fish assemblages reflect physical habitat degradation and changes in land cover. We sampled the ichthyofauna and environmental characteristics of 16 stream sites of first and second order in the Upper Tocantins River basin. The streams were classified according to their environmental characteristics into reference (n = 5), intermediate (n = 4), and impacted (n = 7). A total of 4,079 individuals in five orders, 12 families, and 30 species were collected. Of the 20 metrics tested, eight were non-collinear and were tested for their performance in discriminating among groups of streams. Three metrics were sensitive to the gradient of degradation: Berger-Parker dominance index, percentage of characiform fish, and percentage of rheophilic individuals. Some commonly used metrics did not reflect the disturbances and many others were redundant with those that did. These results indicate that the metrics derived from fish assemblages may be informative for identifying the conservation status of streams, with the potential to be used in biomonitoring.

Effect of trapping methods on the estimation of alpha diversity of a phlebotomine sandfly assemblage in southern Mexico								MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY				31	4			392	401		10.1111/mve.12253			DEC 2017	2017	The aims of the study were to (a) investigate the effect of trapping methods on alpha diversity; and (b) enhance the knowledge of the sandfly assemblage in the state of Quintana Roo. Field work was undertaken in a tropical forest of southern Mexico from August 2013 to July 2014. Sampling was conducted monthly during three consecutive nights. For each trapping night, 12 different types of trap were operated from 18.00 to 24.00 hours in four transects. Measures of alpha community diversity were based on the quantification of the number of species (Chao 2, Jackknife 2, Clench's equation, Margalef's index) and the community structure, as well as the dominance (Simpson and Berger-Parker indexes) and evenness (Shannon's entropy index, true diversity of the Jost and Pielou index). With a total sampling effort of 1728 night-traps, 16 101 phlebotomine sandflies were collected; they represented two genera and 13 species. Diversity estimates of 100% (Chao 2 and Clench's equation) and 85% (Jackknife 2) of potential species in the study area were calculated. Shannon traps and CDC light traps indicated the largest number of species, but only Shannon traps showed the greatest abundance. This inventory of sandflies is an important activity to enhance our knowledge of sandfly assemblages and guilds. The ultimate goal of studying alpha diversity in sandflies would be to have a better understanding of the population dynamics and all complex networks of interactions that may, in turn, be associated with the epidemiology of the disease.

Sensitivity of phytoplankton metrics to sample-size: A case study on a large transitional water dataset (WISER)								ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				82				558	573		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.07.022			NOV 2017	2017	Phytoplankton is a key element for the assessment of ecological and environmental status of aquatic ecosystems, also in the frame of the MSFD. The methods used to analyse phytoplankton communities are mainly based on time consuming cell counts, dictating a trade-off between the number of cells counted and the number of phytoplankton samples in a monitoring plan, whenever the financial budget, the available personnel or the response time are limited. We investigated the optimal sample size effort, intended as number of phytoplankton cells enumerated per sampling station, of many commonly used metrics. To this aim, precision and uncertainty of the metrics as a function of the sample size have been addressed using a case study carried out in the Lesina lagoon (Apulia, Italy), where 12000 cells per sample have been enumerated within five sampling stations. Overall, we show that some of the commonly used indices/metrics for the description of phytoplankton communities are strongly dependent upon the sampling effort (as number of enumerated individuals per sample), while other metrics are relatively independent. Metrics based on the number of taxa only (e.g. Taxonomic richness), on the ratio between number of taxa and number of individuals (e.g. Margalers diversity index) or on the species evenness (e.g. Pielou's evenness index) strongly depend on the sample size and their uncertainty (in term of sampling variance) is usually large. On the other hand, metrics of taxonomic diversity accounting for the proportional abundance of each taxa (e.g. Shannon-Wiener's diversity index), metrics accounting for the dominance of the most abundant taxa (e.g. Berger-Parker's dominance index) and metrics derived from the individual size distribution (e.g. Index of Size spectra Sensitivity, ISS Phyto) are able to achieve high precision and low uncertainty already at small sample sizes (virtually less than 200 enumerated cells) and thus they minimize the allocated effort vs. the gained information. Accordingly to our observations, we provide recommendations about the metric selection and the optimal effort per sample to be allocated in phytoplankton monitoring plans.

The following species Akodon montensis, Brucepatter-sonius sp. and Thaptomys nigrita (Tribe Akodontini), as well as, Euryoryzomys russatus, Nectomys squamipes, Oligoryzomys nigripes, and Sooretamys angouya (Tribe Oryzomyini) are analyzed. A complete taxonomic list with a total of 25 species of helminths, including Digenea (Dicrocoeliidae), Cestoda (Hymenolepididae) and Nematoda (Trichuridae, Capillariidae, Cooperidae, Helligmonellidae, Oxyuridae, and Onchocercidae) is provided. Twenty new host and locality records for Misiones, Argentina, are reported and the results of the ecological descriptors of component communities are given. The highest value of richness was observed for A. montensis (S=8) and E. russatus (S= 7). The diversity index (H') reached values between 1.03 and 1.39 in all rodents, with the exception of N. squamipes that reached 0.75. The equitability indeces with highest value were observed for T. nigrita and E. russatus. The Berger-Parker index of dominance was similar for all host species. The highest prevalence, mean abundance and mean intensity values corresponded to Nippostrongylinae, followed by Syphacinii. This survey constitutes the report with the most diverse parasitic assemblage of rodents described for the Atlantic Forest ecoregion and for Argentina.

We used fourteen digital camera traps equipped with infrared triggers to sample the medium-sized and large mammal communities for ca. 34 (+/- 1.64) days per site. Diversity was measured as both Shannon entropy and Fager's number of moves (NMS), and dominance was quantified using the Berger-Parker index. We used Kruskall-Wallis tests to investigate if there were statistically significant differences in richness, diversity and dominance among the sites. At an overall sampling effort of 1,946 trap days we recorded 216 independent observations of a total of 20 species belonging to 17 genera and 15 families. Richness and diversity appeared to be determined by forest structure, since, independent of the level of human impact, the richest areas were those closest to the ombrophilous forests of southern Guyana shield, closest to central Amazonia, whereas the poorest were at those sites closest to the vegetation mosaics of central Guyana shield. The disappearance of Tayassu pecari from the impacted areas as well as higher relative abundances in the protected areas, albeit not significant, foresees a possible bleak future for the mammalian assemblages in the near future.

Grasslands cover large areas of many countries, provide high levels of provisioning ecosystem services and are an important habitat for many species. While grasslands are often anthropogenic in nature, human-induced environmental perturbations are acknowledged threats to their biodiversity and functioning. Using a repeat survey of grassland plots in Scotland, UK we identified long-term changes in community composition and species indices over a 40 year period (1973-2013). Scottish grasslands were found to have changed significantly over this time. Species richness increased, while diversity declined as dominant species increased in cover. Nitrogen-demanding and moisture-requiring species increased, possibly reflecting increases in atmospheric nitrogen deposition and rainfall over this time. In Acid and Nardus grasslands species with low tolerance to very acidic soils increased, possibly reflecting a decrease in sulphur deposition. Overall beta-diversity showed no change, indicating that contrary to trends in other habitats, homogenisation has not occurred. In general bryophytes and low-growing forb and grass species declined while taller species increased. This may reflect either the decline in grazing in recent years or the increase in atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Species richness increased but the majority of species declined in cover while a few dominant species increased suggesting that an extinction debt may be establishing. The trade-offs between increased management to reduce the extinction debt and abandonment with increased shrub cover which might be beneficial to other wildlife is discussed.

We found remarkably higher taxonomic richness in the tiankeng habitats than in the outside-tiankeng habitats at the species, generic, and familial levels. The inside-tiankeng habitats had higher floristic diversity but lower dominance. The remarkably higher uniqueness at all taxonomic levels and the much larger tree size in the two tiankeng habitats than in the outside-tiankeng habitats demonstrated the old-growth and isolated nature of the tiankeng flora. Plot-scale species richness, ShannonWiener index, Pielou's evenness, and Berger-Parker dominance significantly differed across habitats. Heterogeneity in floristic composition at the species, generic, and familial levels was extremely significant across habitats. In pairwise comparisons, except for the Chuandong Tiankeng-Shenmu Tiankeng pair, all the pairs showed significant between-habitat heterogeneity in floristic composition. Our results suggest that as oases amidst the degraded karst landscape, tiankengs serve as modern refugia that preserve old-growth forest communities with their rich floristic diversity, and can provide a model for habitat conservation and forest restoration in that area.

Fifty adult specimens caught by professional fishermen in March 2015 were necropsied. The fish presented an average standard length of 25.2 +/- 2.2 cm and average weight of 328.82 +/- 89.03 g. A total of 5,227 specimens of metazoan parasites were collected: 2,880 (55.1%) adult Diplectanum piscinarius (Monogenoidea: Diplectanidae) and 2,347 (44.9%) Austrodiplostomum compactum metacercariae (Digenea, Diplostomidae), both with 100% prevalence and mean abundance of 57.6 and 46.9, respectively. Parasite diversity was low (species richness = 2), with a Simpson index (D) equal to 0.505, and low values of Brillouin (HB = 0.687) and Margalef diversity (I = 0.117) indices. Berger-Parker's index of dominance (p = 0.551) indicated a slight dominance of the monogenean parasite D. piscinarius. There was a positive correlation, assessed by Pearson coefficient between parasite abundance of D. piscinarius and standard length (r = 0.43) and weight (r = 0.51) of hosts.

The gills of 100% of the hosts were parasitized by Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Protozoa), Sciadicleithrum juruparii (Monogenoidea) Genarchella genarchella, Posthodiplostomum sp. (Digenea) Ergasilus coatiarus and Argulus multicolor (Crustacea), and a total of 27,043 parasites were collected. However, the dominance was of I. multifiliis and there was aggregated dispersion of parasites with greater discrepancy for S. juruparii and A. multicolor. Low species richness of parasites (3.1 +/- 1.1), low Brillouin diversity index (0.27 +/- 0.23), low evenness (0.16 +/- 0.13) and high dominance of Berger-Parker (0.88 +/- 0.15) were found. The community of parasites in S. jurupari was characterized by low species richness, low diversity and low evenness, with high prevalence and low abundance. The size of host did not have any influence on the parasites community, but the host behavior and availability of infective stages of the parasites were factors structuring the community of ectoparasites found here.

The occurrence of sandy sections, determined from well-log signatures and illustrated on the reconstructed surface, can be used as an aid in locating potential hydrocarbon reservoirs within the Golconda Marl Member. Micropaleontology is used to infer (a) paleodepth and (b) changing paleoenvironmental conditions throughout the Cipero Formation. Foraminiferal investigation of 21 Cipero Formation samples collected at the La Fortune Anticline (LFA) places the Golconda Marl Member of the Cipero Formation at this site in the Globorotalia fohsi peripheroronda planktonic foraminiferal Zone (N9/M6). Planulina wuellerstodi, recovered in abundance, places the LFA section and remaining Golconda Member at water depths >700 m. The statistical similarity of the benthic foraminiferal assemblages in the >63 mu m and >106 mu m fractions suggests winnowing of the LFA section, which is thus hypothesized to comprise a contourite. The statistical similarity of previously published data from Zones N6/M3 and N12/M9 (Shannon's H, the Berger-Parker Dominance Index, Evenness E, a Nutrient Flux Index [NFI = sum of proportional abundances of Bolivina + Bulimina + Uvigerina], and the Benthic Foraminiferal Dissolved-Oxygen Index [BFOI]) suggests that these were deposited in comparable paleoenvironments with, in contrast to Zone N9/M6 at the LFA, relatively little bottom current action.

All the fish collected (100%) in a tributary from the Amazon River system were infected by one or more parasite species. The mean species richness of parasites was 4.9 +/- 0.9, the Brillouin index was 0.39 +/- 0.16, the evenness was 0.24 +/- 0.09 and the Berger-Parker dominance was 0.81 +/- 0.13. A total of 1316 metazoan parasites were collected, including Anacanthorus pithophallus, Anacanthorus furculus, Ancistrohaptor sp.

(Diplostomidae), Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus (Camallanidae), Echinorhynchus paranensis (Echinorhynchidae) and Ergasilus sp. (Ergasilidae), but monogenoideans were the dominant parasites. These parasites presented an aggregate dispersion pattern, except for P.(S.) inopinatus, which showed a random dispersion pattern. The body conditions of the hosts were not affected by the parasitism levels. This first report of these parasites for T. rotundatus indicates that the presence of ectoparasites and endoparasites was due to hosts behavior and availability of infective stages in the environment, and this was discussed.

Until now, no comprehensive analysis of the occurrence of morphological groups in the biofilm of wastewater treatment devices has been performed. Wanting to fill this gap, the aim of the present article was to determine the structure of the biofilm in the technological system of a WWTP in Lublin (Poland). Abundance of individuals from the following morphological groups was assessed: fungi, flagellates, algae, testate amoebae, ciliates, rotifers, and nematodes. Additionally, values of three biocoenotic indices were determined, that is, the Shannon Diversity, McIntosh Evenness, and Berger-Parker (dominance). Results have demonstrated differences in the structure of the biofilm between the devices. Flagellates and fungi dominated in the mechanical part, whereas the biological elements were dominated by ciliates, amoebae, and rotifers and the treated wastewater by algae and ciliates. Indices indicated the simplest biofilm structure (the lowest biodiversity) at the mechanical stage and at site of discharge of treated wastewater to the receiver. Knowledge of the biofilm structure may be useful for assessment of conditions prevailing in wastewater treatment devices. Moreover, it can be a starting point to develop a quick and low-cost bioindication method applicable in all devices, which can be complementary to standard physicochemical methods.

The objectives were to describe the aquatic Coleoptera and Hemiptera from the stream,. seasonal variation in their abundance and dominance, and also examine to their relationship with the environmental variables of the water. A total of 7 species (2 Coleoptera and 5 Hemiptera) were recorded from the system. Three Hemipteran species (Ptilomera assamensis, Metrocoris nigrofashioides, Rhagovelia sumatrensis) and one Coleopteran species (Orectogyrus sp.) occurred throughout the year. Shannon Weiner diversity index values in different seasons ranged from 0.36 in post monsoon to 0.52 in pre monsoon, while Berger Parker Index of Dominance ranged from 0.46 in pre-monsoon to 0.72 in post monsoon. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) showed that the species-environment correlations of axis 1 and 2 were high, and the majority of species responded negatively to total alkalinity. The study on the aquatic insects of a lotic system is a pioneer study in the Sanctuary as no work has been done so far on this and the study add data of the faunal diversity of the Sanctuary. This study suggested that species richness and density of aquatic insects may indicate the conservation value of the habitats because of their significant responses to environmental factors.

The anuran fauna of the northern portion of the NC is still poorly known if compared to the southern portion. The Restinga is one of the predominant environments of the coastal plains of the NC and it is characterized essentially by presenting sandy soil covered by herbaceous and shrubby vegetation. The objective of this study was to determine the anuran species composition and diversity for the Restinga of the Conde municipality. Sampling was carried out at night by active search over four periods of five consecutive days each, two over the 'main rainy season' and two in a 'lesser rainy season', using 14 sample units (SUs) and five extra sample plots (EPs). We calculated dominance and species diversity using the Berger-Parker and Shannon-Wiener H' indices, respectively. We used accumulation curves and the Jackknife 1 estimator to estimate anuran species richness, considering only the data obtained from the SUs. We recorded 713 anuran specimens distributed within 33 species, 13 genera and five families (Bufonidae, Craugastoridae, Hylidae, Leptodactylidae and Microhylidae). The Hylidae and Leptodactylidae families had the highest species richness. Considering only the SUs (Jackknife 1 estimator in brackets), we recorded 28 species in the study area (33.9 +/- 2.3), 13 in Shrubby Vegetation Zones - SVZ (20.8 +/- 2.9) and 25 in Freshwater Wetland Zones - FWZ (28.9 +/- 1.9). The abundance and species diversity of the FWZ (n = 638 specimens; H' = 2.4) were higher than those recorded for the SVZ (n = 52 specimens; H' = 1.9). The SVZ and FWZ showed distinct dominant species, wherein Pristimantis paulodutrai was the dominant species in SVZ and Scinax fuscomarginatus in FWZ. The Restinga of the Conde municipality stands out as the one with the highest anuran species richness already recorded considering only SVZ and FWZ. Moreover, its anuran species composition represented 55% of the anuran species known for the NC and included taxa common to three different morphoclimatic domains (Tropical Atlantic, Cerrado and Caatinga).

The floodplain forest in Tabasco, Mexico, a threatened plant community								ACTA BOTANICA MEXICANA				115				75	101					2016	2016	The structure, composition and diversity of the floodplain forest (SMPC) of Bravaisia integerrima were studied in the two largest forest stands in Tabasco, Mexico: the Ecological Reserve Yu-Balcah (YCAH) with 271 ha, and State Park La Chontalpa (PECH) with 191 ha. In each forest stand 10 plots of 1000 m(2) were sampled. Tree individuals sampled were identified to species, and evaluated in three age categories, seedlings, saplings, and adults. The relationship between species richness and sampling effort was analyzed using Chao 2, ICE, Jacknife 1, Jacknife 2 and Bootstrap. The structural analysis was based on the importance value index. The diversity of species was evaluated, using the Margalef index (D-Mg), alpha de Fisher, Shannon-Wiener (H') and equity of Pielou J. The dominance indices of Berger-Parker (d) and Simpson (D) were also used. The total number of species was 76, belonging to 64 genera and 33 botanical families. The richest family was Leguminosae with 15 species. The basal area of the sites YCAH and PECH was 37.2 and 29.5 m(2)ha(-1), respectively. Bravaisia integerrima was the most important tree species in all stands, with an Importance Index of 277. The value of the Shannon index was 2.0 in both sites. YCAH showed the best ecological condition. Six species present in the stands are considered as threatened in Mexico (NOM-059-SEMARNAT-2010). The current extent of the floodplain forest of Bravaisia in Tabasco State is 490 ha. The results suggest that the structure and composition of this forest has been affected by human activity. As a consequence, to guarantee the conservation of these remnants of SMPC in Tabasco, it is important to verify their legal situation and the application of management plans, designed to improve the productive activities of the rural communities that live around the stands. To succeed in this endeavor, it is necessary that governmental actors, academics, non-governmental organizations, and civil society work together.

J	Dias, M. K. R.; Tavares-Dias, M.								Seasonality affects the parasitism levels in two fish species in the eastern Amazon region								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY				31	6			1049	1055		10.1111/jai.12865			DEC 2015	2015	Fish parasite communities have strong interactions with the environment, the host fish, and the aquatic invertebrate communities. Thus, factors directly involving their different life cycles, such as different host populations and environments, as well as seasonal fluctuations in water levels can cause different responses. The main factors structuring parasite communities may be the hydrodynamic variations, together with seasonal variations in the availability of infectious stages of parasites in the environment. The purpose of this study was therefore to investigate the influence of the rainy and dry seasons on parasite infracommunities in fish species in the Amazon River System of Brazil. Between October 2009 and April 2011, specimens of Colossoma macropomum and Colossoma macropomum x Piaractus brachypomus hybrids (tambatinga) were examined for the presence of parasites. The parasite communities were similar in these two species that both showed aggregate dispersion, although the hybrid specimens were less parasitized. For both hosts, the Brillouin diversity, species richness, evenness and Berger-Parker dominance indices were similar in the rainy season and dry season, except that the Berger-Parker dominance index for the C. macropomum x P. brachypomus hybrid was higher during the dry season. Ichthyophthirius multifiliis was the dominant parasite, followed by Piscinoodinium pillulare, in both hosts. However, C. macropomum had a higher prevalence and abundance in the dry season, while in the C. macropomum x P. brachypomus hybrid, only the I. multifiliis prevalence increased. The abundance of monogenean species (Anacanthorus spathulatus, Linguadactyloides brinkmanni, Mymarothecium and Notozothecium janauachensis) was higher during the dry season in the gills of C. macropomum. Despite overdispersion of the lernaeid Perulernaea gamitanae, a seasonal pattern was seen only in the C. macropomum x P. brachypomus hybrid, with higher prevalence in the rainy season. The low prevalence and abundance of the ectoparasites Tetrahymena sp., Trichodina sp. and Braga patagonica, as well as of the endoparasites Procamallalus (Spirocamallanus) inopinatus and Neoechinorhynchus buttnerae, were not affected by seasonality. This information is applicable in farming practice for these economically important fish, as it indicates the best time for prophylactic management and treatment against parasites, in order to prevent economic losses in fish farms.

Batillaria zonalis Bruguiere was the dominant species in the majority study sites during all seasons. Statistical analysis of the sampled data was performed, which covered the community composition, distribution of the number, diversity index, the principal component analysis (PCA), Spielmann rank correlation matrix analysis, Kulczynski comparative analysis of species richness, Mine-Laying-Curtis clustering of several areas in four seasons. The results showed that the Shannon-Wiener diversity index was higher in January and lower in August. The Simpson diversity indices in the different study sites were quite variable, with the highest being at H-1 site in April, and lowest at H-3 site in August. The Berger-Parker dominance index for the animal is much different in all the sampling sites, which could be either relatively large, or high to low. The role of PCA had the same or opposite direction of the three components. The Spielmann rank correlation matrix analysis showed a positive and high degree of linear correlation among some groups. The Kulczynski comparative analysis demonstrated that the correlation coefficient between G-point and H-3-point in January and April was bigger, and it was smaller between H-2 site and other sites in October. Species richness displayed a regular distribution. The Mine-Fields-Curtis clustering analysis showed that the similarity in different seasons was good, with the highest similarity reaching 87.1302 at H-3 site between January and October, and the lowest similarity only reaching 3.1693 at the H-2 site between August and October.

Culture dependent diversity and phylogeny of thermophilic bacilli from a natural hot spring reservoir in the Gir Forest, Gujarat (India)								MICROBIOLOGY				84	5			687	700		10.1134/S0026261715050124			SEP 2015	2015	The thermophilic bacteria, isolated from a natural hot spring reservoir, Tulsi Shyam (Gir Forest, Gujarat, India) were characterized and diversified using the conventional approaches; Gram reaction, cell morphology, growth patterns, biochemical properties and antibiotic sensitivity. The bacteria were Gram positive, rod shaped and catalase positive. Majority of them produced amylase, indicating their ecological and biotechnological significance. The bacteria were further categorized on the basis of the amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) patterns, generated by a tetracutter RE, HaeIII. As a polyphasic taxonomy approach, the isolates were clustered into 9 different groups, based on the conventional approaches and the ARDRA patterns. The further analysis was based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The trend suggested that the phenotypic and phylogenetic diversity data considerably coincided. Overall, the part of Tulsi Shyam hot spring bacterial community represented by cultivated aerobic organotrophs can be clustered into 3 Genera, Anoxybacillus, Geobacillus/Aeribacillus and Bacillus. They can further be grouped into sub-clusters at the species level to establish phylogenetic and phenotypic relationship. Further, the diversity indices; Simpson's index, Dominance index and Shannon index indicated the species diversity, species richness and distribution evenness, respectively. A lower Simpson's index (0.1905) and higher Dominance index (0.8095) revealed significant bacterial diversity. While a higher Shannon index (2.987) suggested evenness in the bacterial distribution in different soil and water samples. The lower values of Berger-Parker Dominance index and Ginni coefficient supported the trends of the Shannon index. As the studied habitat was not earlier explored for the bacterial diversity, the findings would significantly add to the knowledge of the cultivation based microbial diversity.		[Kikani, B.

J	da Conceiao, Eltamara Souza; Charles Delabie, Jacques Hubert; Castro Della Lucia, Terezinha Maria; Costa-Neto, Antonio de Oliveira; Majer, Jonathan David								Structural changes in arboreal ant assemblages (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) in an age sequence of cocoa plantations in the south-east of Bahia, Brazil								AUSTRAL ENTOMOLOGY				54	3			315	324		10.1111/aen.12128			AUG 2015	2015	A study of succession of ant species in plantations of different ages and development may assist with our understanding of the dynamics of their assemblages. The aim of this study was to characterise the relationship between development of Brazilian cocoa plantations and the nature of their dominant ant assemblages. A chronosequence of cocoa plantations aged 1, 3, 4, 8, 15 and 33 years was sampled by several methodologies. Data were analysed in terms behavioural dominance and Berger-Parker's dominance index (here based on frequency data), and also by principal component analysis and analysis of co-occurrence. Apart from lower numbers of species being found in the 1-year-old plantation, there was no consistent trend in ant richness with plantation age. According to the criteria we adopted, only one species reached behavioural dominance in most age classes of plantation, although this increased to three in the 8-year-old one, before declining to zero in the oldest plantation. No species reached Berger-Parker's dominance in the youngest plantation, whereas all other age classes contained one to three dominants. Particular species showed non-age-related variations in their degree of Berger-Parker's dominance and this could in part be related to which species initially colonised the plantation. Principal component analysis axis 1 was partly related to plantation age, indicating an age-related change in assemblage composition. Ant species co-occurrence could only be effectively detected in cocoa plantations from 3 to 15 years of age. The arboreal ant assemblage is dynamic in nature, with the competitive hierarchy among species oscillating along the cocoa development chronosequence. The assemblage structure could be influenced by the initial founding ants, as well as by the invasive Monomorium floricola.

Richness, breeding environments and calling activity of the anurofauna of the lower moa river forest, state of Acre, Brazil								ZOOLOGIA				32	2			93	108		10.1590/S1984-46702015000200001			APR 2015	2015	In state of Acre, most anuran research has been carried out in areas of terra firme, whereas alluvial forests remain relatively unexplored. We document the richness, breeding environments and calling season of the anurans of the Lower Moa River in the Alto Jurua (state of Acre), a region considered to harbor high biodiversity. Sampling was conducted in two main areas with different forest typologies (Terra firme forest and Alluvial forest), totaling 256 ha. The diversity of anurans was analyzed using the Shannon-Wiener index, evenness and Berger Parker dominance. The anurans were sampled from October 2008 to September 2009, using the following sampling methods: sampling at breeding sites, pitfall traps, time constrained visual search during the day (TCVSD); at night (NVTCS) and active search (AS). Fifty anuran species, belonging to eight families, were recorded: Aromobatidae (2), Bufonidae (5), Hemiphractidae (1), Hylidae (25), Leptodactylidae (9), Microhylidae (4), Ranidae (1) and Craugastoridae (3). Pitfall traps totaling 1440 day-buckets in the year. DVTCS had a total sampling effort 72 hours/person/year; NVTCS 72 hours/person/year and AS 24 hours/person/year. Greater richness (35 species) was recorded in the alluvial forest, low diversity index and high dominance (H' = 1.69, J' = 0.51, d = 0.62). Most likely, these values were influenced by the high relative abundance of Rhinella margaritifera in this area. The richness of the alluvial forest may be associated with environmental heterogeneity according with the theory of intermediate disturbances. The breeding activity of most species occurred in lentic environments (lakes and temporary ponds) and during the rainy season. When sampling anurans in the Amazon it is important to use two or more sampling method and to consider the different forest typologies of this biome for a better characterization of its richness.

Here we analyze the prevalence, intensity and diversity of the helminth component communities associated with the white stork Ciconia ciconia and black stork Ciconia nigra, and notice the findings of helminths on Eurasian spoonbill Platalea leucorodia and glossy ibis Plegadis falcinellus obtained in the Czech Republic in years 1962-2013. Comparison with datasets from multiple European countries supports the existence of well-defined local helminth component communities, which are subject to strong geographic variation. The estimated diversity of the helminth component communities reached 11.0 +/- 1.6 (C. ciconia) and 12.5 +/- 5.4 (C. nigra) species, with the Berger-Parker dominance index reaching only 0.24 and 0.21, respectively. Typically, the dominant species (Chaunocephalus ferox, Tylodelphys excavata and Dictymetra discoidea in C. ciconia, and Cathaemasia hians and Dicheilonema ciconiae in C. nigra) were considered as local, with intermediate host species available onsite. Altogether 10 of the 11 species with known life cycle were capable to complete their life cycle locally, which is in strong contrast with the situation in Czech egrets and herons. In C. ciconia and C. nigra, the highest helminth load was in juveniles, whereas Echinostoma sudanense, absent in the juveniles, was associated with intermediate hosts absent in the study area. Relative prevalence and frequency of helminths associated with male and female C. ciconia was similar to each other. The first systematically collected evidence of the intra-annual changes of the helminth assemblages in storks is provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The evaluation of the impact of different management strategies on soil quality is increasingly sought, and the determination of community structures of edaphic fauna can represent an efficient tool. In the area of Langhe (Piedmont, Italy), eight vineyards characterized for physical and chemical properties (soil texture, soil pH, total organic carbon, total nitrogen, calcium carbonate) were selected. We evaluated the effect of two types of crop management, organic and integrated pest management (IPM), on abundance and biodiversity of microarthropods living at the soil surface. Soil sampling was carried out in winter 2011 and spring 2012. All specimens were counted and determined up to the order level. The biodiversity analysis was performed using ecological indexes (taxa richness, dominance, Shannon-Wiener, Buzas and Gibson's evenness, Margalef, equitability, Berger-Parker), and the biological soil quality was assessed with the BSQ-ar index. The mesofauna abundance was affected by both the type of management and sampling time. On the whole, a higher abundance was in organic vineyards (N = 1981) than in IPM ones (N = 1062). The analysis performed by ecological indexes showed quite a high level of biodiversity in this environment, particularly in May 2012. Furthermore, the BSQ-ar values registered were similar to those obtained in preserved soils.

It is concluded that over-collection has caused vegetation and soil degradation. However, most descriptions of the ecological impact of collection were qualitative and the impact on plant communities has not been quantified precisely. Collection plots and control plots were established in three counties on the Tibetan Plateau in order to measure impacts of collection on plant community composition. The results showed that due to Chinese cordyceps collection, species diversity expressed as the Shannon-Wiener indices significantly decreased by 10-13%, community dominance expressed as the Berger-Parker indices significantly increased by 17-32%, vegetation cover significantly decreased by 11-19% and aboveground biomass significantly decreased by 21-46%. However, root biomass did not change significantly, and only a few soil physical and chemical indicators in some plots changed significantly. Although Chinese cordyceps collection caused ecological degradation, the undisturbed plant roots and soil guarantee vegetation recovery. Aboveground biomass was the most sensitive variable to Chinese cordyceps collection, and could be used as the evaluation indicator in efforts of ecological protection and recovery.

Vascular species were surveyed along trails in different Cerrado physiognomies, with special regard to shrub and tree species. Additionally, in the areas of cerrado sensu stricto 30 plots of 10x3 m were installed, wherein only woody individuals > 1 m tall were sampled. Overall, 220 species, 150 genera and 65 families of different life forms were surveyed, including species considered as rare in the Brazilian Cerrado and possible new records for the Cerrado of Mato Grosso do Sul. Shrub and tree species richness in the cerrado sensu stricto was high (79-101 species per site). There was a low floristic similarity among sites: only 50 species were common to all of them. The study of the woody vegetation by plots (total of 651 individuals of 105 species) revealed a difference in average richness, diversity (Shannon index) and dominance (Berger-Parker) among the studied sites. In addition, species relative densities and floristic composition were quite variable among sites (similarity from 0.42 to 0.53). These results place the studied sites among the richest areas of cerrado sensu stricto in Brazil, showing that marginal areas of Cerrado can be as rich as their core areas, even by the contribution of floristic elements of other forest formations. The results also reinforce the existence of a high floristic heterogeneity in the Cerrado, even at relatively short distances (<= 60 km), which can be triggered by differences between fragments in respect to soil characteristics, disturbance history and proximity to other forest formations.

Diet specialization in <i>Octopus vulgaris</i> at San Salvador, Bahamas								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				516				229	237		10.3354/meps11070			DEC 3 2014	2014	Populations of resource generalists are often made up of individuals specializing on a narrower range of resources; such individual specialization can have important ecological and evolutionary significance. We quantified individual diet variation in Octopus vulgaris, the common octopus, at 3 locations around San Salvador, Bahamas, using repeated collections of midden contents. We quantified the degree of individual specialization using the proportional similarity index and individual diet breadth using the Berger-Parker index of dominance and the number of prey types per den. As in other populations, the San Salvador O. vulgaris population has a broad diet, consuming at least 49 prey types; however, most individuals (59%) had significantly specialized diets. The amount of specialization varied significantly among locations. At one location, all octopuses were generalists and consumed relatively uniform proportions of prey types (lower dominance) compared to the other 2 locations, where about 70% of individuals were specialists with diets dominated by 1 or a few prey types. Individual specialization has been documented in numerous species but mostly vertebrates; this is only the second quantified example from the cephalopods.

J	Baranova, D. V.; Kabanov, P. B.; Alekseev, A. S.								Fusulinids (Foraminifera), Lithofacies and Biofacies of the Upper Moscovian (Carboniferous) of the Southern Moscow Basin and Oka-Tsna Swell								PALEONTOLOGICAL JOURNAL				48	7			701	849		10.1134/S0031030114070016			DEC 2014	2014	Twenty-nine fusulinid species of 14 genera are determined in the Podolskian and Myachkovian substages (Pennsylvanian) of the southern Moscow Basin. All test sections are determined to genus level, except for the genera Schubertella and Fusiella. Since it is impossible to distinguish between these two genera in oblique test sections, they are identified to the family Schubertellidae. The stratigraphic distribution of fusulinid species put on a new sequence-stratigraphic framework (succession of cyclothems) reveals nonsimultaneous appearance of zonal assemblages in different localities. Sporadical occurrence of index species below and above their designated zones attest for shortage of reliable biostratigraphic markers within the Upper Moscovian interval. The legacy acmezones Fusulinella bocki and Fusulina cylindrica appear to be the most robust divisions in the regional fusulinid zonation. The Podolskian-Myachkovian stratigraphic interval is characterized by progressive decline of Neostaffella, whereas representatives of Fusulina show inverse development. The genus Fusulina changes its facies preference from normal marine subtidal facies in the Podolskian to shoal peloidal-bioclastic grainstones in the upper half of the Myachkovian. Fusulinid genera tend to be distributed patchy and within a broad facies range. It is confirmed that the staffellid genera Reitlingerina and Parastaffelloides are good indicators of shallow-water normal marine euphotic conditions. The genus Hemifusuina occasionally masses in mud-dominated tempestitic limestones of shallowing-upward (regressive) parts of cyclothems. Schubertellids were the most tolerant group as seen from their steady presence in the entire spectrum of marine facies of the studied basin. Five fusulinid biofacies are recognized in the Upper Moscovian: (1) Fusulinella-Ozawainella, (2) Staffellida, (3) Staffellida-Fusulina, (4) impoverished Schubertellidae, and (5) Hemifusulina. These paleo-biofacies are based on mean densities of fusulinids in thin sections (tests per cm(2)), data departure criteria of these mean densities, the Shannon diversity index H, and Berger-Parker index of dominance d. Degree of differentiation of fusulinid biofacies is notably low, which is explained by unsteady benthic environments affected by frequent storm dispersals of benthic organisms and geologically rapid eustatic sea level changes. The relation of fusulinid, conodont, and general biofacies is discussed. Three general biofacies are recognized: staffellid-syphonean (photozoan and transitional hetero-photozoan), bryonoderm extended (heterozoan), and Meekella-Ortonella (assemblages of stressed shallow-lagoon to tidal-flat habitats).

J	Orlowski, Grzegorz; Czarnecka, Joanna; Golawski, Artur								Winter diet of Yellowhammers <i>Emberiza citrinella</i> on contemporary farmland: the different contribution of forbs, wild grasses and cereals in semi-natural and agricultural habitats								BIRD STUDY				61	4			484	495		10.1080/00063657.2014.954984			OCT 2 2014	2014	Capsule Composition of Yellowhammer diet differed significantly between two major habitat categories: semi-natural (fallow lands, abandoned grassland and road verges) and agricultural habitats (managed fields, stubble fields and manure heaps). Semi-natural habitats and winter stubble fields were important sources of non-cereal plant food and plant parts of cereals were the staple diet in fallow lands, managed fields and manure heaps. Aims To determine the composition of the winter diet and food niche of Yellowhammers feeding on various farmland habitat types characteristic of lowland agricultural areas in Central Europe. Methods Diet was determined on the basis of faecal sample analysis. Multivariate analysis of variance, principal component analysis and two measures of diversity (Shannon Diversity Index and Berger-Parker Index of Dominance) were used to assess the variation in contribution of various plant parts of dicotyledons (henceforth referred to as forbs), wild grasses and cereals in the diet. Results Dietary composition differed significantly between six types of farmland habitats, as well as between these habitats pooled into two major habitat categories: semi-natural and agricultural ones. Plant parts of cereals (grain fragments and husks) were the staple diet in fallow lands, managed fields and manure heaps and were the sole items consumed in crop fields. Plant parts of dicotyledon weeds were eaten almost exclusively in semi-natural habitats. The contribution of wild grasses was highest in stubble fields. The most diverse diet was in fallow lands (road verges > manure heaps > abandoned grasslands > stubble fields) and the most simple in managed fields. Overall diet diversity was positively correlated with the proportion of parts of forbs (dicotyledonous weeds) and negatively correlated with the proportion of pooled fragments of wild grasses and cereals. Conclusion Semi-natural habitats and winter stubble fields are important sources of non-cereal plant food for Yellowhammers. In particular, unpaved roads and fallow land support dicotyledonous weed seeds (Polygonum spp.), and manure heaps contain cereal plant food (probably both husks and seeds from the faeces of farm animals and straw used as litter in their bedding). Contemporary changes in weed communities as a consequence of intensification of agriculture that has reduced this flora to certain abundant nitrophilous species (e.g. Polygonum spp., Chenopodium album, Echinochloa crus-galli and Setaria spp.), the seeds of which are often consumed by Yellowhammers, can therefore increase the food resources of granivorous birds. A mosaic landscape with crop-free plots and microhabitats (with patches of permanent vegetation like road verges), stubble fields (with natural regeneration of annual weeds) and manure heaps enables Yellowhammers to find local feeding grounds, especially during periods of thick snow cover, when feeding sites or resources in open farmland are inaccessible.

Floristic diversity of valonia oak silvopastoral woodlands in Greece								AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS				88	5			877	893		10.1007/s10457-014-9733-2			OCT 2014	2014	Valonia oak (Quercus ithaburensis subsp. macrolepis (Kotschy) Hedge and Yaltirik), a deciduous species grown in the xerothermic conditions of the east Mediterranean zone of Europe, forms woodlands of open canopy that permits adequate light to reach the ground thus sustaining an exceptionally rich flora. In Greece, these woodlands are mainly used for livestock grazing and considered important silvopastoral systems. Nowadays, most of them are abandoned and degraded as a result of inappropriate management. For the effective evaluation and sustainable management of these woodlands and the establishment of reliable monitoring systems, a detailed analysis of their plant diversity characteristics across Greece is needed. This paper aims at determining and comparing floristic diversity measures as well as at assessing the impact of human activities on vegetation and floristic diversity of the most characteristic valonia oak silvopastoral woodlands of Greece. It was found that the truncated log-normal model adequately predicts the species abundance data for eleven out of the twelve woodlands. From the statistical comparison of the diversity indices Q-statistic, Berger-Parker dominance index and Shannon-Wiener measure of equitability, three groups of these woodlands can be distinguished (a) the high-richness group of Pentalofos, Lesvos, Lakonia and Thesprotia, (b) the medium-richness group of Kriti Island, Alexandroupoli, Strofylia and Galaxidi, and (c) the low-richness group of Kea Island, Amfilohia, Almyros and Lilaia. However, the R,nyi's diversity ordering diagram showed that, generally, in low levels of entropy inconsistency is the rule and no clear pattern of diversity is extracted reflecting the impact of complex factors. Among them, those related to management seem to mostly determine plant diversity of valonia oak silvopastoral woodlands, with abiotic factors having an occasionally supporting role. Changes of species richness and evenness due to livestock grazing as well as acorn and wood harvesting are further discussed.

Choosing and using diversity indices: insights for ecological applications from the German Biodiversity Exploratories								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				4	18			3514	3524		10.1002/ece3.1155			SEP 2014	2014	Biodiversity, a multidimensional property of natural systems, is difficult to quantify partly because of the multitude of indices proposed for this purpose. Indices aim to describe general properties of communities that allow us to compare different regions, taxa, and trophic levels. Therefore, they are of fundamental importance for environmental monitoring and conservation, although there is no consensus about which indices are more appropriate and informative. We tested several common diversity indices in a range of simple to complex statistical analyses in order to determine whether some were better suited for certain analyses than others. We used data collected around the focal plant Plantago lanceolata on 60 temperate grassland plots embedded in an agricultural landscape to explore relationships between the common diversity indices of species richness (S), Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's diversity (D-1), Simpson's dominance (D-2), Simpson's evenness (E), and Berger-Parker dominance (BP). We calculated each of these indices for herbaceous plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aboveground arthropods, belowground insect larvae, and P.lanceolata molecular and chemical diversity. Including these trait-based measures of diversity allowed us to test whether or not they behaved similarly to the better studied species diversity. We used path analysis to determine whether compound indices detected more relationships between diversities of different organisms and traits than more basic indices. In the path models, more paths were significant when using H', even though all models except that with E were equally reliable. This demonstrates that while common diversity indices may appear interchangeable in simple analyses, when considering complex interactions, the choice of index can profoundly alter the interpretation of results. Data mining in order to identify the index producing the most significant results should be avoided, but simultaneously considering analyses using multiple indices can provide greater insight into the interactions in a system.

The execution of this research was based on 119 host specimens collected between March 2011 and September 2012, and the results were compared to studies performed on periods before the reservoir's construction, when 110 fishes were collected between March 1992 and February 1993. Five parasite species still remain on the environment, despite the environmental modifications: Choanoscolex abscissus, Spasskyelina spinulifera, Nomimoscolex pertierrae, Harriscolex kaparari and Contracaecum sp 2. The Berger-Parker dominance index, calculated to the parasite fauna of 1992, did not show the dominance of any species, while, on the present days, this same index accused the dominance of Nomimoscolex pertierrae (49%) and Choanoscolex abscissus (50%). The present study reports the disappearance of Megathylacus travassosi, Contracaecum sp. 1, Contracaecum sp. 3, Procamallanus (Spirocamallanus) sp. and Cucullanus pseudoplatystomae, suggesting the possibility of a local extinction or a host switch of these species. It has also been registered an Acanthocephala specimen, a genus not observed on this host yet. The results here presented show that the antropic influences on natural systems alter the environmental conditions, what is reflected on the richness and diversity parasite levels.

The study revealed the presence of three orders, nine families, twelve genera and eighteen species of aquatic insects in the lower reach of the river. The orders were Hemiptera, Odonata and Coleoptera. There was total absence of sensitive groups of aquatic insects like Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera. According to Engelmann's scale, Diplonychus rusticus (Fabricius) was found eudominant followed by five subdominant and six recedent species. No species was found in the dominant range. Species diversity and evenness indices fluctuated throughout the year and Shannon H'< 1 in all the months indicated a stressed and disturbed environment. This is confirmed by the record of low dissolved oxygen (DO), high biological oxygen demand (BOD) and high phosphate in the water of the river. Among the heavy metals, the ranges of both lead and mercury were found to exceed the WHO maximum permissible limit. Significant positive correlation of rainfall with pH, DO, BOD, nitrate, phosphate, Berger Parker dominance index (d) and significant negative correlation with diversity index (Shannon H') indicated that rainfall is one of the important parameters in the ecology of the system. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) revealed that the important physico-chemical attributes of the ecosystem were air temperature, water temperature, depth, rainfall, BOD, DO, salinity, sodium, total alkalinity, iron and lead.

Differences in composition and diversity of diet and food niche overlap were assessed through multivariate analysis of variance (manova), Shannon Diversity Index and the Pianka index. Diet specialization was measured by application of the Berger-Parker index of dominance.Results manova indicated significant differences in diet composition among all three species. House Martins showed the most diverse diet, Swallows were intermediate and Swifts least diverse. Average body mass of all prey found in the diet of Swifts was nearly three times smaller than in Swallows and two times smaller than in House Martins.Conclusion Our findings show that these three species consume the same types of insect prey, but they take different proportions, and hence biomass, of the major prey groups. House Martins had the widest niche and greatest overlap.

The moths were captured at every new moon phase, two nights per phase, from December 2008 to November 2010. We evaluated the following parameters: richness, abundance, dominance, constancy, diversity indexes and evenness (Shannon H' and E'; Brillouin H and E), and Berger-Parker dominance (BP). Richness estimates were made by nonparametric procedures: Bootstrap, Chaol, Chao2, Jackknife 1, Jackknife2 and Michaelis-Mentem. We captured a total of 910 specimens belonging to 85 species of Arctiinae. Values of parameters for the total period were: H' = 2.58, E' = 0.581, H = 2.45, E = 0.576 and BP = 0.433. Both richness and abundance were higher in 2009-2010, while diversity and Shannon and Brillouin evenness were higher for the year 2008-2009.

We examined different indices that are frequently used in literature as for their sensitivity and ability in tracing vegetation changes during a post-fire succession. Field data from a forest in Sithonia peninsula, northern Greece, during a period of 10 years after a fire event were used as a case study. In order to detect the best model fit of diversity and evenness indices we used pseudovalues generated with the jackknife method. The index of evenness and diversity with the lowest coefficient of variation scores were selected as the ones with the best model fit. In order to select the abundance model with the best model fit we compared the difference of the observed abundances data from the jackknife-predicted ones using the Akaike information criterion. According to our results, in rich and medium soil types, the best diversity ecosystem index from the ones examined was the (inverse) Berger-Parker one, while in poor soil types the Simpson or Brillouin diversity index. According to our results, in rich and medium soil type Mediterranean ecosystems, a good biodiversity ecosystem descriptor is based on how abundant is the most abundant species. In poor soil types where there are fewer species, and the percentage of cover is lower, indices that account for the relative representation of species within the community structure are better biodiversity ecosystem descriptors. All evenness indices examined but the Smith-Wilson were good ecosystem descriptors. The abundance model that showed the best model fit was the log series one. The poor fit of the Smith-Wilson's index suggests that in species poor ecosystems the number of species is more important than species variance.

In this paper, phytoplankton investigation and environmental assessment for the dredged area in Daqing Estuary Section of Dianchi lake in Kunming city was reported. After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

Nine mussel ropes were sampled at random in each quarter, and 1,208 organisms were identified, comprising five families and 28 species. The most numerous species was the porcellanid Pachycheles laevidactylus (18.5%), followed by the xanthids Acantholobulus schmitti (16.6%), Hexapanopeus paulensis (11.3%), Panopeus americanus (10.2%), and Menippe nodifrons (8.4%). The exotic crab Charybdis hellerii was recorded throughout the study period. The ecological descriptors, except Pielou evenness index, varied significantly over the time. The highest abundance and diversity of the species were recorded during November and February. This pattern was reversed for Berger-Parker dominance, with the lowest values recorded in February. The development of epifauna was correlated with the different stages of the mussel farms, since the mean size of mussels and consequently the abundance of epibiotic organisms and the structural complexity on the mussel ropes increased from May (seeding) until February (harvest). Despite this, the temporal population variations in recruitment patterns of the different epibionts should not be overlooked. The results indicated that the mussel farms provided favorable conditions for the development of these crustacean groups, which could be used in environmental monitoring programs and / or be exploited for the aquarium trade.

This study analyzed the species constancy and the structure of the polistine wasp community associated with fragments of riparian forest in the municipality of Bataypora, state of Mato Grosso do Sul. Eighteen species of social wasps were collected, by the methods of active searching and traps baited with honey and sardine. Eight species were classified as infrequent, five as very frequent, and five as of intermediate frequency. The community structure, as represented by species richness, showed a significant negative correlation with the Berger-Parker dominance index, and no significant correlation with the width of the fragments and with the structural complexity of the vegetation, suggesting that the community, in this case, must be structured by the tolerance of the species and not by the vegetation characteristics, which did not limit the dispersal of the social wasps.

Farnon								Macrobenthic assemblage structure in a cool-temperate intertidal dwarf eelgrass bed in comparison with those from lower latitudes								BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY				104	3			527	540		10.1111/j.1095-8312.2011.01738.x			NOV 2011	2011	The evolution and ecology of latitudinal patterns in marine macrofaunal biodiversity and assemblage structure are contentious. With the aim of investigating the occurrence of such patterns in intertidal dwarf eelgrass beds (Nanozostera spp.), those at cool-temperate Scolt Head Island, UK (latitude 52 degrees N), were examined and compared with equivalent systems in warm-temperate Knysna, South Africa (34 degrees S), and subtropical Moreton Bay, Australia (27 degrees S): systems that had earlier been examined using an identical methodology. The Scolt Head bed supported the highest faunal density (mean 6568 0.1 m(-2)), lowest observed and estimated species richness (32 and 33 spp., respectively), lowest species diversity (Simpson's index of diversity 0.34), highest mean constancy index (23.0), lowest proportion of total numbers contributed by singletons or doubletons (0.06%), largest Berger-Parker dominance index (0.81), and least degree of variability between component samples. The beds at Knysna were intermediate between those at Scolt Head and at Moreton Bay in all those respects, as well as in nature and composition of the fauna. Similar dwarf eelgrass beds at Arcachon, France, likewise appear intermediate between those of Scolt Head and Knysna. Community variance in all three regions was greatest at the smallest spatial scale of < 1 m, at which scale two of the three sites also displayed randomly organized faunal assemblages, although this changed to non-random at larger spatial scales. Assemblages were deterministically structured at all spatial scales at Knysna. A consistent series of changes in structural characteristics of macrofaunal dwarf-eelgrass assemblages therefore occurred along the latitudinal sequence of Scolt Head (53 degrees), Arcachon (45 degrees), Knysna (34 degrees), and Moreton Bay (27 degrees). Community assembly patterns did not change with latitude, however, but did so with spatial scale in two of the three regions.

Eleven samples were taken between February 2007 and February 2008 in Santa Maria La Reforma lagoon (northwestern coast of Mexico). In total, 337 fish was examined; 5 parasitic copepod species were observed, including Acantholochus zairae, Caligus serratus, Lepeophtheirus simplex, Pseudochondracanthus diceraus, and Parabrachiella sp. The most common species were L. simplex, P. diceraus, and C. serratus (overall prevalence, 59, 53, and 35%, respectively), which significantly varied in prevalence and mean intensity between sampling months. A seasonal pattern was only observed for L. simplex, with higher infection levels in the warmest month than in the coldest month. Statistical analyses indicated that the intensity of L. simplex was positively correlated with water temperature. There were no significant differences in prevalence and intensity of infection among female and male hosts. At the component community level, species richness ranged between 4 and 5 during most of the study period, and no seasonality was observed in the number of individuals, Shannon diversity index, evenness index, or the Berger Parker dominance index. At the infracommunity level, 4 descriptors used (mean species richness, mean number of individuals, mean Brillouin's diversity index, and mean Berger Parker index) varied significantly between sampling months, but no seasonality was observed, except for a slight increase in the number of individuals during the warmest month. A significant positive association was detected between number of individuals and water temperature and between host size and both species richness and number of individuals. This is the first account of the ecology of these 5 parasitic copepods. Although no significant association was detected between fish condition factor and the burden of parasitic copepods, given the high occurrence of the caligid copepod L. simplex, we suggest that this copepod could represent a threat for the culture of S. annulatus.

Spatiotemporal variations of the ichthyofaunal structure accompanying the seabob shrimp, <i>Xiphopenaeus kroyeri</i> (Crustacea: Penaeidae), fishery in important fishery areas of the Santa Catarina shore, Brazil								ZOOLOGIA				28	2			151	164		10.1590/S1984-46702011000200002			APR 2011	2011	The present study analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively the temporal and spatial changes in the fish assemblages present in seabob shrimp distribution sites in two important fishing areas of the Santa Catarina coast. Monthly bottom trawls, conducted between March 2007 and February 2008 in Balneario Barra do Sul and Penha, yielded a total of 38,608 specimens belonging to 54 species, of which 35 occurred in both regions. The Sciaenidae was the most represented family in both number of species and abundance of individuals. The dominant species were Stellifer rastrifer (Jordan, 1889), S. brasiliensis (Schultz, 1945), Paralonchurus brasiliensis (Steindachner, 1875), Isopisthus parvipinnis (Cuvier, 1830), Trichiurus lepturus (Linnaeus, 1758), and Pellona harroweri (Fowler, 1917). The ichthyofaunal structure showed a spatiotemporal dependence with significant differences in March 2007 and January and February 2008 between Balneario Barra do Sul and Penha. The main differences were attributed to dominant species, which were responsible for significantly altering the abundance of the assemblages. The species richness was similar in both sites, whereas the diversity and equitability indices showed monthly fluctuation patterns that differed between Balneario Barra do Sul and Penha. The Shannon index differed in August, September and November 2007 and January and February 2008, with an H' ranging from 0.74 to 1.98 influenced by dominant species, whereas significant variations were observed for the Pielou index in November 2007 and February 2008. The Berger-Parker index demonstrated a clear dominance pattern where the monthly numeric contribution of a single species ranged from approximately 30 to 80%. Although the results showed differences between fishing grounds 25% of the time, we conclude that fish assemblies captured as accompanying fauna in artisanal seabob shrimp fisheries showed statistically similar characteristics for most of the year, although Balneario Barra do Sul and Penha are 35 km away from each other.

Adaptability and vulnerability of high flying Neotropical aerial insectivorous bats to urbanization								DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS				17	2			262	274		10.1111/j.1472-4642.2010.00738.x			MAR 2011	2011	Aim Urbanization is a dominant demographic trend throughout the world that involves massive habitat alterations. Understanding how urbanization affects biota is a crucial prerequisite for development and application of effective species conservation programmes. Our study focuses on Neotropical high flying aerial insectivorous bats, an ecologically important, but so far seriously understudied group of vertebrates. Location Panama. Methods Using acoustic monitoring, we assessed and compared species occurrence, composition and activity of aerial insectivorous bats at three site categories located on the isthmus in Panama: forest, urban areas and a forest-town interface. Results In 2 years of field work, we recorded 44,744 bat passes over the microphone and identified a total of 25 aerial insectivorous bat species. Species richness was highest in the forest, decreased towards the forest-town interface and was lowest at the urban sites, while dominance (Berger-Parker-Index) increased from the forest to the urban sites. Overall, general bat activity (passes min-1) was highest at the forest-town interface and lowest at the urban sites. Multivariate analysis suggests compositional differences in species occurrence and activity among site categories with mainly molossid species occurring in urban areas. Main conclusions Our results clearly demonstrate species-specific differences between high flying aerial insectivorous bats concerning their adaptability and vulnerability to urban areas. Our results suggest that a suite of morphological traits including species mobility determine persistence of aerial insectivorous species in cities. Our results underline the necessity for detailed assessments of species-specific habitat requirements and dynamics of species occurrence and activity over time to develop meaningful conservation tools targeted at aerial insectivorous bats.

The parasite communities are analyzed at the levels of host individuals (infracommunities), host age groups (sets of infracommunities), and host population (component community). The number of parasite species regularly increases as the roaches age in both aquatic bodies, whereas the evenness of the parasite communities decreases. The Berger-Parker dominance index of the parasite communities changes with the roach age in different directions, increasing in the Chivyrkuiskii Bay and decreasing in the estuary of the Selenga River. The changes in the Shannon diversity index for sets of infracommunities of roach parasites are the opposite of those in the Berger-Parker index.		[Dugarov, Zh N.; Pronin, N. M.; Sondueva, L.

Berger-Parker dominance index, a Fisher alpha diversity index, Margalef richness indexand Equitability J evenness indexwere used. The results showed more abundance and diversity of regenerated species in the understory of all oak plantations than in the implanted control plots and also a greater abundance of regenerated species under pure stands of oak than in mixed plantations. The highest species richness was found in the 60Q:40Z treatment. The presence of primary forest species in the understory of mixed plantation can help to restore natural forests.		[Hosseini, S.

In this context, a study of species distribution and community structure of stream fish Limoeiro, BA along a spatial gradient in one year, using electrofishing as the collection method. Twenty one fish species were collected totalizing 2264 specimens in four points: two points near the head (P1A and P1M), one in the middle course (P2) and another near the mouth (P3). Characiformes and Siluriformes were the orders more important among the four registered. Some species occurred exclusively at the head (Astyanax sp. and Trichomycterus cf. bahianus) and other near the mouth (Leporinus sp. and Callichthys callichthys). On the other hand, Characidium zebra, Parotocinclus cf. cristatus, Poecilia vivipara, Astyanax sp.1, Rhamdia sp. and Poecilia reticulata occurred all sampling points. Was collected one specie the "status" of vulnerable (Nematocharax venustus) and two exotics (Tilapia rendalli and Poecilia reticulata). About the community structure, the values of the index of richness of "Margalef" and of the index of diversity of "Shannon" were greater in this point P3, then this point were significantly lower value of "Berger-Parker" dominance index. The point with riparian vegetation preserved (P1M) showed a lower average water temperature and the points near the head (PIA and P1M) showed the highest values of dissolved oxygen and surface velocity. Conductivity, width and depth of the medium increased toward the mouth. Several results are in accordance with the current literature dealing with community ecology of neotropical stream fish.

Macroinvertebrate samples were collected in six Italian rivers along a pool-riffle sequence in three seasons following a multihabitat sampling technique. Chironomids were identified as genus/species, other macroinvertebrates as family/genus. The main physico-chemical, hydromorphological and geographical data were collected. Samples were ascribed to five quality classes according to the STAR_ICM index. Based on Chironomid taxa, principal component analysis (PCA) axis 1 represented an organic pollution gradient, axis 2 represented seasonality. Pool and riffle samples were significantly different according to taxa assemblages. Similar results were obtained with PCA based on the whole macrobenthic community. Indicator value (IndVal) analysis facilitated the detection of the Chironomid indicators of high/good quality pools (e. g. Conchapelopia pallidula, Rheopelopia ornata, Epoicocladius ephemerae) and riffles (Tvetenia calvescens, Eukiefferiella gracei). The Berger-Parker dominance index based on Chironomid assemblages in pools was correlated to PCA axis 1 and performed well in discriminating between quality classes. In riffles, no correlations to PCA axes were detected and a wide overlap between quality classes was present. Thus, assessment in the analysed river type may focus on pool mesohabitat as this seems to represent best the ecological gradient of sites. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

We used the database of the Joint Danube Survey JDS-2, organised by the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (ICPDR, Vienna), to assess the relationship between water flow velocity and the occurrence and abundance of aquatic macrophyte to be species along the navigable reach of the Danube River. Species abundance was assessed in accordance with European Standard EN 14184-2003. Flow velocities were assessed close to the plant stands and estimated in 4 classes, worked out in earlier studies in combination with flow meter measurements, which is appropriate for the conditions in this large river. Statistical analysis revealed that only survey units with either no visible flow or those with fast flow were characterised by indicator species with high significance. Still water conditions or barely visible flow (flow class 1) were indicated by Potamogeton friesii, Nitellopsis obtusa and Trapa natans, and by Potamogeton perfoliatus, Potamogeton nodosus and Stuckenia pectinata. Lemna minor, indicative for flow class 1 as well, was detected in all the other flow classes, too: in all these cases it established its stands closely intermingled with other aquatic species. For survey units with slow (flow class 2) or intermediate flow (flow class 3). No statistically significant indicator species could be determined. The highest flow velocities (flow class 4) were significantly indicated by Fissidens rufulus, Cinclidotus fontinaloides and Cinclidotus riparius. Occurrence of aquatic mosses was also highly related to the Berger-Parker dominance index in NMDS analysis. In the same analysis, but towards the smallest flow velocities, the majority of vascular species and the Simpson diversity index were closely related. The spectrum of life forms was considerably reduced under medium and high flow velocity conditions. With regard to Simpson species diversity, our analysis indicates an agglomeration of diversity in the Middle Danube reach that includes the Iron Gates impoundment. Our results offer a first look at the macrophyte/water flow relationship of a very large river in Europe, the Danube. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using Berger-Parker's dominance index and Sorenson's coefficient, the index of dominance and predator-predator, predator-prey, and prey-prey associations were defined among each of these species to determine changes in species compositions and population densities and comprehend the influence of pesticide use in pest management on populations of spider and predatory mites in apple orchards. Sorenson's coefficient helped to measure the intensity of positive, neutral, or negative interspecific associations for each species and Berger-Parker's dominance index clarified the dominance of specific species. During 2005 the dominant species in both localities was P. ulmi, but during 2006-2007 at one locality both species of spider mites showed almost equal dominance. The results of Sorenson's coefficient confirmed that there was significant predator-prey association among P. ulmi and A. andersoni and P. ulmi and Z. mali, and prey-prey association between P. ulmi and T. urticae in both localities. The analysis of the population dynamics showed delayed occurrence of predatory mites compared with the spider mites, from 48 to 106 days for A. andersoni and 91 to 137 days for Z. mali depending on the research period and locality.

A total of 1,180 oribatid mite specimens, belonging to 67 different species, were extracted from soil samples. Significant differences in species diversity, abundance and Berger-Parker index of dominance were found among the different vegetation types throughout the sampling period, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (n-MDS) ordination confirmed a clear separation between the three coenoses, showing how oribatid assemblages are significantly affected by habitat evolution. The faunistic knowledge of the oribatid mites of Sardinia is rather poor, the present research represents one of the first contributions for the main Sardinian island. Besides a majority of eurytopic and widespread species representing the main part of the edaphic communities in Mediterranean landscapes, some rare and characteristic species are recorded. They are remnants of the original populations of Sardinia and the western part of the Italian peninsula, resulting from the complex tectonic events that formed the western Mediterranean basin. Among these, Belorchestes gebennicus Grandjean, 1957 (Zetorchestidae), Microppia minus longisetosa Sub as & Rodriguez, 1988, and Pluritrichoppia insolita Sub as & Arillo, 1989 (Oppiidae) had never been collected in Italy, single individuals of Oxyoppioides and Thamnacarus probably belong to undescribed species, while Brachychthonius hirtus Moritz, 1976 (Brachychthoniidae), Mongaillardia aeoliana (Bernini, 1979) (Amerobelbidae), Berniniella aeoliana (Bernini, 1973), Lauroppia similifallax Sub as & Minguez, 1986, Ramusella (Ramusella) gyrata (Mahunka & Paoletti, 1984) (Oppiidae) and Ophidiotrichus oglasae Bernini, 1975 (Oribatellidae) are new to the Sardinian fauna.

Highest number of species was present in pre-monsoon (29) and lowest in winter (23). Members of Chlorophyceae were present in a reasonable number throughout the year while being most abundant in pre-monsoon and monsoon. Bacillariophycae and Cyanophyceae populations did not show much seasonal variation. Percentage composition of Euglenophyceae showed clear seasonal change, being most dominant in post monsoon, moderate in pre-monsoon and winter and nearly absent in monsoon. Total phytoplankton density showed highly significant positive correlation with transparency (p < 0.01) and significant positive correlation with total suspended solids, total hardness and calcium (p < 0.05). Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') value (2.66) was found to be the highest during pre-monsoon while the highest evenness (J') value (0.89) was recorded during winter Berger-Parker index of dominance (0.45) was highest in post-monsoon. Our study revealed that the growth of phytoplankton is governed by transparency, total suspended solids, calcium and total hardness. These types of studies are prerequisites for evolving fish culture programmes and management of water resources.

Composition of the Araneae (Arachnida) fauna of the provincial Ibera Reserve, Corrientes, Argentina								REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL				57	1-2			339	351					MAR-JUN 2009	2009	A Survey of the spider community composition and diversity was carried out in grasslands and woods in three localities: Colonia Pellegrini, Paraje Galarza and Estancia Rincon (Ibera province Reserve). Pit fall traps, leaf litter sifting, foliage beating, hand collecting and sweep nets were used. Shannon's diversity index, evenness, Berger-Parker's dominance index, beta and gamma diversity were calculated, and a checklist of spider fauna was compiled. Species richness was estimated by Chao 1, Chao 2, first and second order Jack-knife. A total of 4 138 spiders grouped into 150 species front 33 families of Araneomorphae and two species front two families of Mygalomorphae were collected. Five species are new records for Argentina and eleven for Corrientes province. Araneidae was the most abundant family (39.8%), followed by Salticidae (10.9%), Anyphaenidae (7.9%) Tetragnathidae (7.4%), and Lycosidae (5.5%). The other families represented less than 5% of the total catch. The web-builder guild had the highest number of specimens and the highest richness index. The abundance, observed richness, Shannon diversity and evenness indexes were highest in Colonia Pellegrini woodland and Paraje Galarza grassland. Alpha diversity represented 89% of the gamma; the remaining 11% corresponded to diversity. According to the indexes, between 67% and 97% of the existing spider fauna was represented in the collected specimens front Ibera. Rev. Biol. Trop. 57 (1-2): 339-351. Epub 2009 June 30.

In all, 29 parasite species/taxa were found in 170 eels: eight digeneans, one monogenean, five cestodes, ten nematodes, two acanthocephalans, and three crustaceans. Measures of diversity characteristics of the helminth communities included species richness, Shannon's diversity index and its evenness, and the Berger-Parker dominance index. The highest species diversity and lowest dominance values were calculated for the helminth communities of eels from the two Baltic Sea localities. Parasite communities of European eels clearly exhibit the habitat preferences of their hosts, salinity-dependent specificities, and a clustering into fresh-water, brackish, and marine groups. The highly pathogenic parasite species Anguillicola crassus and Pseudodactylogyrus spp. were found at all sampling sites in fresh water and brackish water, with high prevalence. Basic information is provided on the risks of restocking programmes solely focusing on fresh-water sites.

The samples came from the upper 1-2 cm of the undisturbed sediments in water less than 2 m deep, along coastline (about 8.5 km in length) proximal to emerged alluvial plain. The entire examined marine area represents a shallow inner shelf, which is physiographically fairly protected and characterized by low turbulence, but subjected to southwards littoral drift. Geochemical analyses of seawater, sediments and foraminiferal tests correlated to biotic indexes (Dominance, Shannon-Weaver, Simpson, Eveness, Menhinick, Margalef, Equitability, Fisher-alpha, Berger-Parker and Q-mode Cluster Analyses - Ward Method) and provide data on environmental stress. A total of 38 benthic foraminiferal species were identified. Increasing pollution results in low species diversity, low population density and more frequent abnormal specimens. Results from ESEM images allow recognition of a strong infestation on the calcareous foraminiferal tests by microbial communities developed in the polluted environment. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE				33	7			703	715		10.1080/10440040903235227			2009	2009	We evaluated the diversity of vascular epiphytes on coffee bushes growing in shaded plantations with different management intensities in terms of the removal of epiphytes: high (all branches), moderate (some branches) and zero (no removal). We chose 160 coffee-bushes within plots with different management regimes and evaluated the species richness and abundance of the vascular epiphytes adhered to those trees. We estimated diversity (Shannon-Weaver index), and dominance (Berger-Parker index) and compared abundances. We found 20, 24 and 20 species of vascular epiphytes in the zero, moderate and high management plots, respectively. The families with greatest species richness were: ferns (5, 8, 8 spp.), orchids (7, 7, 6 spp.) and bromeliads (3, 3, 2 spp.). Abundance was statistically similar for all three management intensities, while diversity was numerically greater at moderate management intensities (1.69) and significantly smaller for intensive management (1.38) (4.28; 108; p < 0.001). Two species were exclusive to moderate management intensity plots Pleopeltis angusta var stenoloma and Anthurium scandens, Pleopeltis astrolepis was the dominant species in all management regimes (0.617, 0.532, and 0.673). High management intensity had a negative effect on epiphyte diversity. The possible impact of other factors is discussed.

J	Kido, Michael H.								A persistent species assemblage structure along a Hawaiian stream from catchment-to-sea								ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES				82	3			223	235		10.1007/s10641-007-9276-8			JUL 2008	2008	In Limahuli Stream on the Hawaiian island of Kauai, species assemblage structure was monitored from catchment-to-sea over a 6-year period to determine how individual species utilized the stream continuum spatiotemporally. A persistent pattern was identified in which ten fish and macroinvertebrate species (nine native and one alien) were distributed into distinct zones of highest abundances with overlapping species ranges. Species diversity, as quantified by a dominance measure (Berger-Parker Index), was highest and least variable at the midpoint of the continuum where upstream-downstream species' ranges converged. Reciprocal fluctuations in the population abundances of dominant species limited overall variation in species diversity to a 22% range which was interpreted as evidence of spatiotemporal persistence of the species assemblage structure. The pattern was captured in a testable, conceptual model which partitions an idealized Hawaiian stream from catchment-to-sea into five functional zones (Estuarine, Lower-Middle-Upper Reach, and Headwaters) positioned as percentages of continuum length. This model may be overlaid upon other Hawaiian streams for testing its applicability as well as to ask a variety of ecological questions about the manner in which species partition habitat spatiotemporally along biophysical gradients.

Parasite communities of these fish were composed basically of endoparasites, mainly digenean and cestodes species, with low prevalence and abundance but having high parasite species richness values (at the component community level). Among these values, that found for P. numida is the highest so far recorded for marine fishes from the Neotropical Region. Thirty-nine species of metazoan parasites were collected: 36 from P. numida and 28 from P. semifasciata. Twenty-five parasite species were common to both species of namorado sandperches. Pseudopercis numida and P. semifasciata are new host records for all parasite species collected, with the exception of Microcotyle pseudopercis. Choanodera sp., Leurodera decora, Neolebouria georgenascimentoi, and Proctoeces sp. which were recorded for the first time in the South American Atlantic Ocean. Gnathia sp. from P. numida and Scolex pleuronectis from P. semifasciata were the species having the greatest dominance frequency. Parasite abundance in P. numida and P. semifasciata were positively correlated with the host total length. Only in P. numida was parasite species richness correlated positively with the host total length. No significant differences between endoparasite infracommunities of P. numida and P. semifasciata were detected. The ectoparasites of P. numida had higher values for parasite abundance, parasite richness, Brillouin index, evenness index, and Berger-Parker index than those of the ectoparasites of P. semifasciata. Comparisons among all ecto- and endoparasites showed the ectoparasites of P. numida as the most heterogeneous group. Low similarity values were observed among the three types of parasite infracommunities of the two hosts.		[Luque, J. L.; Tavares, L. E.

Water quality changes indicated significant differences (p < 0.05) in conductivity, dissolved oxygen, BOD5, COD, total hardness, nitrate-nitrogen and phosphate-phosphorus between the three stations sampled. Higher values of these parameters were observed at the impacted station. The abundance and community structure of Diptera patterns, especially Chironomidae, Culicidae and Syrphidae families (all indicative of poor water quality) showed strong evidence of impact from the abattoir effluents. Comparisons of abundance values demonstrated high significance (p < 0.05) between the impacted station and the upstream (station 1) and downstream station (station 3). Shannon index and Berger-Parker dominance were greater at the impacted station (station 2). Analysis of faunal similarities showed that upstream station l(unpolluted site) was significantly different from stations 2 and 3. The distinct taxa found in station 2 (the impacted station) suggest that the organic input from the abattoir favoured their abundance as most of them were opportunistic species.

Trees with dbh >= 5 cm were sampled in one hundred 10 x 10 m plots randomly placed in a 6.5-ha stand. Through partial Mantel test, floristic dissimilarities among plots (Jaccard index computed with species abundance in each plot) were correlated with environmental distances among plots (Euclidian distance index computed with relative elevation and the tallest tree height values in each plot). Relative elevation and the tallest tree per plot height were individually correlated with floristic gradients expressed by PCA axes scores using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Through resampling, we compared diversity (richness, Berger-Parker D and Shannon H') among plots in the drier (up) and moister (low) ends of the slope. Floristic dissimilarities were significantly correlated with environmental distances even after geographic distances among plots have been partialled out (r (m) = 0.1274, p < 0.001). The first two PCA axes accounted for 22% of the total variance. After Bonferroni and Dutilleul's corrections, axis 1 showed a marginally significant correlation with plot relative elevation (r = -0.4097, p = 0.0309), and axis 2 was significantly correlated with the tallest tree height per plot (r = 0.2953, p = 0.0106). Position on the slope and vegetation disturbance were reliable predictors of community composition, thus suggesting the operation of niche assembly organizing processes. Richness and diversity (H') decreased and dominance (D) increased with elevation on the slope. Dominance increase from D ((300)) = 0.11 (confidence interval = 0.091-0.131) to D ((300)) = 0.19 (CI = 0.165-0.210) surpassed the expected dominance increase based on the reduction of richness alone: D-(300) = 0.13 (CI = 0.110-0.140), thus highlighting the niche partitioning assembly of the community, especially among abundant species. Given the great amount of floristic variability remaining unexplained, stochastic processes, such as those related to dispersal limitation, may also have influence on the community composition. Therefore, both niche assembly and chance events can operate even on a fine local scale.

Large reductions in faunal density ( 60,132 to 1881 individuals ha (-1)) and increases in diversity ( H' = 0.93 - 2.54), through increases in richness ( ES( 220) = 7.6 - 18.8) and reductions in dominance ( Berger - Parker index = 0.77 - 0.38) were found between 270 and 720 m water depth. Assemblages were separated into distinct shallow, intermediate and deep faunas by multivariate community analysis. In the shallower sites there were high levels of iceberg disturbance, directly reducing diversity as well as creating a complex, patchy environment inhabited by high densities of mobile suspension- feeding epifauna. In the deeper areas there was small- scale disturbance from the deposition of drop stones, but at a relatively low frequency and magnitude, which allowed increased species diversity. Proportions of deposit- feeding epifaunal and infaunal taxa rose with depth, as indicated by an increase with depth in faunal traces. Decreases in faunal density probably resulted from decreased food supply with depth.		Natl Oceanog Ctr, DEEPSEAS Grp, Southampton SO14 3ZH, Hants, England; [Jones, Daniel O.

J	Nitterus, Karolina; Astrom, Marcus; Gunnarsson, Bengt								Commercial harvest of logging residue in clear-cuts affects the diversity and community composition of ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae)								SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH				22	3			231	240		10.1080/02827580701352955			2007	2007	Structural complexity of the habitat is known to influence the diversity and abundance of arthropod populations. Earlier studies have shown that presence of logging residue ( slash) on the ground contributes to microhabitat complexity and removal of slash for biofuel in clear-cuts can have short-term ( similar to 1 year) effects on ground-active beetle populations. This study examines the consequences of slash removal on carabids (Coleoptera: Carabidae) 5-7 years after harvest. Sampling of beetles was done by pitfall trapping in three matched clear-cut pairs, in spruce forest in central Sweden. The number and diversity (Berger-Parker dominance index) of carabid species were significantly higher in clear-cuts with slash harvest than in sites where slash was left on the ground. No difference in the overall rank-abundance pattern was found between clear-cuts with different slash treatments, but for species with certain habitat preferences the community was significantly altered. In all clear-cuts, slash removal caused a shift in dominance with an increase in generalist species and a decline in forest species. The results show that removal of slash may have long-lasting effects on the carabid community composition and structure. Hence, in forest landscapes with large-scale biofuel harvest, generalist carabid species may increase their abundance. Following the precautionary principle, it is suggested that every fifth clear-cut should be free of slash harvest.

Six cestode species were found: Tetraphyllideans Calliobothrium barbarae, C. australis, C lunae and Orygmatobothrium schmittii, diphyllidean Echinobothrium notoguidoi and trypanorhynch Eutetrarhynchus vooremi. The most common number of parasite species per host was 3. Brillouin's diversity index ranged from 0.1 to 1.2. Berger-Parker dominance index indicated that C barbarae was the dominant species, followed by O. schmittii and C. australis. Calliobothrium barbarae, C australis and O. schmittii presented a broad distribution along the spiral intestine, whereas C. lunae, E. notoguidoi and E. vooremi showed a more restricted niche breadth. In general, the Renkonen's index showed no evidence of niche overlap in the range of distribution of the different species. In most of the infracommunities, intraspecific aggregation was stronger than interspecific aggregation, indicating that competition may play a little role. The distribution patterns of the Calliobothrium specimens concurs with the predictions of attachment sites for Calliobothrium species made by previous authors.

Investigating environmental variation and landscape characteristics of an urban-rural gradient using woodland carabid assemblages								JOURNAL OF BIOGEOGRAPHY				33	6			1126	1138		10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01476.x			JUN 2006	2006	Aim To investigate environmental variation and associated assemblage changes of carabid beetles along an urban-rural gradient. Location 'Quercus-Acer' (oak-sycamore) woodlands in the city of Birmingham, UK. Methods We collected carabid data using pitfall traps on 12 sites in the city. The traps were run from April-September in 2000, and we collected environmental data on 24 individual variables associated with the individual sites and their landscape context. Changes in carabid assemblages were analysed using repeat measures ANOVA and the environment-species relationships with a Redundancy Analyses (RDA) and Generalized Linear Modelling (GLM). Results We found that: (1) species richness and diversity were lower in the urban and suburban zone and higher in the rural zone; (2) Berger Parker dominance index was higher in the urban and suburban zones; (3) the number of woodland and woodland associated species was significantly higher at the rural end of the gradient; (4) the number of short-winged (brachypterous) species was highest in the rural zone and decreased towards the urban woodlands, whereas the long-winged species were more abundant in suburban woodlands; (5) the median weight length (WML) of the assemblage declined along the gradient from the rural to the urban zone, as did the number of large species; and (6) five of the 24 environmental variables showed a significant relationship with variation in the carabid assemblage. At site level the carabid assemblages were related to the level of site disturbance and soil penetrability, whereas site size and amount of woodland and urban land within 5 km of the site were important at a larger landscape scale. Main conclusions The results suggest that urbanization has a deleterious impact on carabid assemblages, causing a reduction in species richness from the rural fringe to the centre of the city. Changes in assemblage structure were related to woodland fragmentation, which led to variations in woodland size, woodland location and site disturbance due to trampling. Large, flightless and specialist woodland species are more susceptible to changes associated with urbanization, presumably due to their longer life spans, lower reproductive rates, more specialized niches and more limited dispersal potential.

At the regional scale, macroinvertebrate communities of perennial and intermittent springs displayed significant differences in the number of taxa, macroinvertebrate community abundance, diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson indices) and the Berger-Parker dominance index at intermediate discharge. However, no significant difference was recorded between intermittent and perennial sites at high discharge or when all sampling occasions were pooled. At the catchment scale, the number of taxa, community abundance and Bray-Curtis similarity coefficients within the River Lathkill differed significantly between intermittent springs and other habitats. At both the regional and catchment scale the macroinvertebrate communities of intermittent springs were characterised by a small number of taxa displaying life cycle adaptations to intermittent aquatic habitats, particularly Trichoptera.

J	Montes, J								Culicidae fauna of Serra da Cantareira, Sao Paulo, Brazil								REVISTA DE SAUDE PUBLICA				39	4			578	584		10.1590/S0034-89102005000400010			AUG 2005	2005	Objective To compare the Culicidae fauna in forest, ecotone and anthropic environments and to analyze their composition according to the number of species and individuals, species richness, diversity, heterogeneity and similarities and to determine species dominance and the relationship between species dominance and climatic factors. Methods CO2-baited CDC light traps were used for mosquito collection twice a month in the Serra do Cantareira State Park from February 2001 to January 2002. CO2-baited CDC light traps were placed in five different environments. The analyses were carried out using Margalef and Menhinick's diversity indexes. Similarity was calculated using the Sorensen index and species dominance was indicated by the Berger-Parker index. Mosquito heterogeneity was estimated using Simpson and Shannon indexes. The correlation between species dominance and climatic factors was estimated by Spearman coefficient. Results There were collected 2,219 Culicidae mosquitoes of 11 genera and 21 species. The forest environment showed the highest species richness (Mg=3.64) and the anthropic environment presented the most dominant species (d=0.85). Temperature showed the greatest positive correlation (Rs=0.747; p < 0.0001) when analyzing the relationship between climatic factors and number of individuals caught in the study area. Conclusions As the Serra do Cantareira State Park is a forest patch inserted in an urban environment, this may have changed the ecological relationships in the Culicidae breeding sites. The absence of Kerteszia subgenus and Culex quinquefasciatus species, in addiction to the presence of Sabethini Tribe specimens and Cx. (Mel.) vaxus species indicate that the Serra da Cantareira State Park is a forest section with sylvan features but show some anthropic interference.

J	Bajer, A; Behnke, JM; Pawelczyk, A; Kulis, K; Sereda, MJ; Sinski, E								Medium-term temporal stability of the helminth component community structure in bank voles (<i>Clethrionomys glareolus</i>) from the Mazury Lake District region of Poland								PARASITOLOGY				130				213	228		10.1017/S0031182004006389			FEB 2005	2005	The structure of helminth communities in wild rodents is subject to seasonal variation, and is dependent on host age within years. Although between-year variation has been monitored, seldom has it been assessed rigorously by appropriate multifactorial analysis with potentially confounding factors taken into account. In this study we tested the null hypothesis that despite seasonal, host age and sex effects, helminth communities should show relative stability between years. Over a period of 3 years (1998-2000) we sampled bank vole (Clethrionomys glareolus) populations (total n = 250) at 2 points in the year: in spring, at the start of the breeding season, and in autumn, after the cessation of breeding. In spite of seasonal differences and strong age effects, the between-year effects were surprisingly small. Measures of component community structure (Berger-Parker dominance index, the dominant species, S. petrusewiczi) did not vary, or varied only slightly from year to year. The majority of measures of infracommunity structure [Brillouin's index of diversity, prevalence of all helminths combined, prevalence and abundance of H. mixtum (the most prevalent helminth), mean species richness] did not differ significantly between years when other factors such as age, sex and seasonal variation had been taken into account. Some between-year variations were found (at the component community level, Simpson's index of diversity; at the infracommunity level, prevalence and abundance of S. petrusewiczi and abundance of all helminths combined), but even these were modest in comparison to seasonal and age differences, and were primarily attributable to S. petrusewiczi. We conclude that despite dynamic within-year fluctuations, helminth communities in bank voles in this region of Poland show relative stability across years. The sporadic occurrence of individual platyhelminths at low prevalence, makes little difference to the overall structure, which is largely maintained by the key roles played by the dominant intestinal nematodes of bank voles and the rarer species collectively.

Despite their low commercial value in terms of wood production they are important feeding resources for domestic and wild animals, provide fuel to local people of remote areas and play a significant role in preventing soil erosion. The complexity and stability of kermes oak ecosystems are approached in this research by analysing the components of floristic diversity. Four shrubland sub-types were identified in northern Greece according to their scaling to shrub density. Nine plots (0.1 ha each) of each shrub cover class were randomly selected and two 50-m transects; were randomly assigned in each plot. Four quadrats per transect were systematically taken and floral composition and taxa richness were recorded. A total of 288 quadrats were taken and differences among the four shrubland sub-types in terms of Shannon-Weiner index of diversity, evenness, Berger-Parker index of dominance, and the first order jackknife plant richness estimator were explored. Finally, the diversity ordering diagram of the four communities based on the Renyi index was made. A total of 287 taxa were recorded and it was found that as the density of the shrublands increases alpha-diversity decreases.

J	Wood, PJ; Armitage, PD								The response of the macroinvertebrate community to low-flow variability and supra-seasonal drought within a groundwater dominated stream								ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE				161	1			1	20		10.1127/0003-9136/2004/0161-0001			SEP 2004	2004	Information regarding the instream response to long supra-seasonal droughts, extending over more than one season, in largely perennial riverine systems is fragmentary compared to knowledge regarding floods. The macroinvertebrate community of a groundwater dominated river was investigated over an eight-year period which included two supra-seasonal drought events (1992 and 1996-1997). The community responded directly to changes in the discharge regime. Significant differences in the community abundance, the abundance of the amphipod Gammarus pulex, diversity indices (Shannon Wiener and Simpson diversity) and the Berger-Parker dominance index were recorded between drought, flow recovery and other (non-drought) years. Drought conditions resulted in extremely low community abundance, Gammarus pulex abundance and the Berger-Parker dominance index, and extremely high values of the Shannon Wiener and Simpson diversity indices. Recovery of the community extended over a two-year period and reflected recovery of flow associated with recharge of the groundwater aquifer. The results underline the continuing need for medium to long-term data series to investigate the response of instream communities to flow variability so that extreme events can be placed within the context of natural variability.

Total helminth species richness was 14 (8 nematodes, 5 cestodes and 1 acanthocephalan) with 94% of mice carrying at least 1 species and an overall mean species richness of 1.85. The most prevalent parasites were Protospirura muricola (47.8%) and Dentostomella kuntzi (46.3%). One larval cestode, Joyeuxiella rossicum, represents a new host record. The helminth community was dominated by intestinal nematodes (88.7%) of which 58.2% were arthropod-transmitted heteroxenic species. At the component community level, 70% of the worms were recovered from mice in just two wadis (Gharaba and Tlah) and 48.6% of intestinal nematodes were from Wadi Gharaba. Although only 7 species of helminths were recorded from Wadi Gharaba, this site gave the highest Berger-Parker dominance index because of P. muricola. P. muricola was also dominant in Wadi El Arbaein whilst Syphacia minuta was the dominant species in Wadis Gebal and Tlah. At the infracommunity level, mean species richness and Brillouin's index of diversity were highest in Wadi Tlah and lowest in Wadi Gebal, and the former was age dependent. Whilst mice from different wadis differed in the nematodes that were most common, those from Wadi Gharaba carried the highest mean number of worms/mouse. The abundance of P. muricola in particular varied markedly between sites: Wadi Gharaba was distinct as the site showing the highest mean worm burden whereas mice from Wadi Gebal were uninfected. None of the directly transmitted oxyuroid nematodes showed significant variation in abundance between wadis, or host sex or age classes. Overall, the single extrinsic factor in the study, site of capture, was more important than the intrinsic factors in explaining variation in helminth communities in the region. We conclude that in the high mountains of southern Sinai, each wadi is distinct in terms of its rodent parasites, and hence we expect spatially different coevolutionary pressures on their hosts, with resultant variation in life-histories.

J	Fountain, MT; Hopkin, SP								Biodiversity of Collembola in urban soils and the use of <i>Folsomia candida</i> to assess soil 'quality'								ECOTOXICOLOGY				13	6			555	572		10.1023/B:ECTX.0000037192.70167.00			AUG 2004	2004	The effects of metal contamination on natural populations of Collembola in soils from five sites in the Wolverhampton area ( West Midlands, England) were examined. Analysis revealed that metal concentrations were elevated above background levels at all sites. One location in particular (Ladymoor, a former smelting site) was highly contaminated with Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn at more than 20 times background levels. Biodiversity indices ( Shannon - Weiner, Simpson index, Margalef index, alpha index, species richness, Shaneven ( evenness) and Berger - Parker dominance) were calculated. Of these indices, estimates of species richness and evenness were most effective at highlighting the differences between the Collembola communities. Indeed, the highest number of species were found at the most contaminated site, although the Collembola population also had a comparatively low evenness value, with just two species dominating. The number of individuals per species were allocated into geometric classes and plotted against the cumulative number of species as a percentage. At Ladymoor, there were more geometric classes, and the slope of the line was shallower than at the other four sites. This characteristic is a feature of polluted sites, where a few species are dominant and most species are rare. The Ladymoor soil also had a dominance of Isotomurus palustris, and was the only site in which Ceratophysella denticulata was found. Previous studies have shown that these two species are often found in sites subject to high metal contamination. Survival and reproduction of the "standard'' test springtail, Folsomia candida (Willem), were determined in a 4 week exposure test to soils from all five sites. Mortality was significantly increased in adults and reproduction significantly lower in the Ladymoor soil in comparison to the other four sites. This study has shown that severe metal contamination can be related to the population structure of Collembola in the field, and performance of F. candida ( in soils from such sites) in the laboratory.

The epicortical beetle assemblages in an Australian subtropical rainforest								EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ENTOMOLOGY				101	2			251	259		10.14411/eje.2004.035			2004	2004	We have investigated the relative importance of bark roughness and host tree species in determining the diversity and make-up of coleopteran assemblages on the trunks of trees in sub-tropical rainforest in south-east Queensland, Australia. There are clear, statistically significant, patterns in the composition of the assemblages which reflect bark roughness. Rougher bark had associated greater species and family richness, a higher proportion of "rare" species, a higher value for Shannon diversity and lower values for the Simpson and Berger-Parker Index (measures of dominance within the sample). The data support strongly the idea that there is a bark-specific beetle assemblage. The rougher bark was associated with significantly greater numbers of an anobiid species, Dorcatoma sp., and of the latridiid species Aridius australicus. Rougher bark also harboured significantly larger species. The most likely explanation for this seems to be related to the physical heterogeneity and biological complexity of the habitat, presenting, as it does, greater opportunities for shelter, feeding specialisation and intra-species aggregation. Rougher bark contained a higher proportion of both predatory and xylophagous groups than did smoother categories. No clear influence of tree species could be detected although some trends were evident.

We assessed a range of species richness and evenness/dominance indices, and the use of species abundance models using samples of bacteria from zinc-contaminated and control soils. Bacteria were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis of 236 clones from each soil. The reduced diversity apparent in the contaminated soil was reflected by the diversity indices to varying degrees. The number of clones analysed and the weighting given to rare vs. abundant OTUs are the most important considerations when selecting measures. Our preferences, arrived at using theory and practical experience, include: the log series index alpha; the Q statistic (but only if coverage is 50% or more); the Berger-Parker and Simpson's indices, although their ecological relevance may be limited; and, unexpectedly, the Shannon-Wiener and Shannon evenness indices, even though their meanings may not be clear and their values inaccurate when coverage is low. For extrapolation, the equation for the log series distribution seems the best for extrapolating from OTU accumulation curves while non-parametric methods, such as Chao 1, show promise for estimating total OTU richness. Due to a preponderance of single-occurrence OTUs, none of the five species abundance models fit the OTU abundance distribution of the control soil, but both the log and log normal models fit the less diverse contaminated soil. Species abundance models are useful, irrespective of coverage, because they address the whole distribution of a sample, aiding comparison by revealing overall trends as well as specific changes in particular abundance classes.

J	Strong, W. L.								Assessing species abundance unevenness within and between plant communities								COMMUNITY ECOLOGY				3	2			237	246		10.1556/ComEc.3.2002.2.9			JUN 2002	2002	A simple to calculate and statistically testable method is proposed for assessing species abundance unevenness or dominance concentration within plant communities. Dominance rather than evenness is considered the preferred measure, because perfect evenness can be defined and used as a benchmark for comparing communities regardless of floristic richness. Four dominance (Simpson, Berger-Parker, McIntosh, and a proposed [D-W]) and four evenness (Carmargo, Gini, Shannon, and Williams) indices are comparatively analyzed. The Simpson, McIntosh, Gini, and Williams indices were correlated with species richness, the Berger-Parker index was correlated with total species cover, the Shannon index over-estimated evenness, the Simpson index under-estimated dominance concentration, and a nonlinear relationship occurred between the Simpson and all of the evenness indices. OnlyD(W)and the Carmargo indices fulfilled the technical requirements established for evenness with appropriate reversals of criteria for assessing a dominance concentration index. Determination ofD(W)was based on the maximum difference between cumulative proportion (also referred to as Lorenz curve or partial order) and perfect evenness values. The conventional assumption that dominance (D) is the complete opposite of evenness (E), as assessed by indices, was found in practice to be lacking, without the inclusion of an error term (i.e., 1 =E+D+ error). Therefore, both dominance concentration and evenness should be reported when characterizing plant communities.		[Strong, W.

We provide a method for identifying such areas in broad-scale surveys of the seafloor using the acoustic discrimination system QTC VIEW. QTC VIEW is an acoustic processing system that assigns sonar ping stacks to clusters of like points, to identify different habitats on the seafloor. Paired QTC VIEW transects (similar to20 m spacing) were run at intervals of 200 in, at two separate sampling locations. to assess the consistency of clustering of individual ping stacks into acoustic classes. Very consistent spatial patterns of class change were found between transect pairs, suggesting high stability in the classification process. QTC VIEW assigns confidence values to each individual record; running averages calculated using a moving window along transects showed drops in confidence values associated with areas of transition in habitat class assignment, but this was not always consistent. The Berger-Parker index, a class dominance statistic, provided a more consistent transition indicator. Class transition ranged from abrupt to gradual, along with areas where a mixture of acoustic classes occurred. However, acoustically detected transition zones did not consistently respond to visual observations of the sea floor. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

The study was undertaken in a 2-week period in late summer in NE Poland in a single year, thereby, eliminating seasonal and between-year variation in parasite burdens. A total of 139 Clethrionomys glareolus (bank vole) were sampled from 3 forest sites of similar habitat quality. Total species richness was 11 (6 nematodes and 5 cestodes) with 85.6% of the voles carrying at least I species and an overall mean species richness of 1.4. At the component community level, the fewest species of helminths were recorded from site 2 (n = 6, compared with 9 at each of the other sites), but site 3 had the lowest Berger-Parker Dominance Index and the highest Simpson's Index of Diversity. At the infracommunity level, site 3 had the highest mean no. of helminth species/vole, the highest mean Brillouin's Index of Diversity but the lowest mean no. of helminths/vole. Voles from sites 1 and 3 differed in the nematodes that were most common (site 1, Heligmosomum mixtum - 95% ; ite 3, Heligmosomoides glareoli - 79.3 %). At site 2 no species exceeded 50% but prevalence of Syphacia petrusewiezi was higher than at the other sites. The prevalence of cestodes was too low to test reliably (12.9 %), but the highest prevalence of adult cestodes was recorded at site 1 (22.5%, compared with 4.9 and 1.7%, for sites 2 and 3 respectively). Host sex did not influence infection, but mean species richness increased with age. The different sites were responsible for most of the variation in our data, and the intrinsic factors (sex and age) were less important in shaping the component community structure of helminths, We conclude that even locations in relative close proximity to one another (13-25 km), selected on the basis of similar habitat quality, have rodent populations that differ in their helminth parasite communities, although for reasons other than the factors quantified in the present studs,.

J	Renfrew, RB; Ribic, CA								Grassland birds associated with agricultural riparian practices in southwestern Wisconsin								JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT				54	5			546	552		10.2307/4003583			SEP 2001	2001	Rotational grazing has been proposed as a Best Management Practice (BMP) for minimizing runoff in Wisconsin agricultural riparian areas. The influence of this land management practice on grassland birds has not been evaluated in relation to more traditional agricultural land management systems in Midwestern riparian areas. This study compared the grassland bird community in riparian areas in Wisconsin that were rotationally grazed to common land use practices along streams in Wisconsin: continuously grazed pastures and rowcrop fields with 10-m-wide ungrazed buffer strips located along the stream. We calculated total number of birds, the Berger-Parker Index of Dominance, and number of birds ha(-1) for each site. Vegetation variables used were height-density, litter depth, and percent bare ground. Bird species richness, species dominance, and density did not differ among land use types. In contrast, grassland bird species of management concern [Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis Gmelin), Eastern Meadowlark (Sturnella magna L.), and Bobolink (Dolichonyx oryzivorus L.)] were found on continuous and rotational pastures but very rarely or never occurred on buffer strips. Contrary to previous research, however, rotationally grazed pastures did not support more of these species than continuously grazed pastures. Bird density was related to vegetation structure, with higher densities found on sites with deeper litter. Within the pasture land use types, there were no consistent differences between species richness and density near the stream (< 10 m) and away (> 10 m).

J	Byrne, CJ; Grey, C; Holland, C; Poole, R								Parasite community similarity between four Irish lakes								JOURNAL OF HELMINTHOLOGY				74	4			301	305					DEC 2000	2000	A total of 140 trout were examined from four lakes in north west Ireland, Loughs Craghy, Waskel, Meela and Owennamarve. Eleven species of metazoan parasite were recorded, ten of which were of freshwater origin and Anisakissp. was the only marine species. No acanthocephalan species were found. Diphyllobothrium ditremum, D. dendriticum and Anisakissp. were the only allogenic species. Lough Owennamarve had the largest component community with nine species recorded. Lough Meela, the only brackish water lake had the smallest component community with six species recorded. Lough Waskel and Craghy had intermediate component community values. Lough Meela showed the lowest levels of similarity to any of the other lakes. Values for the Shannon-Wiener diversity index were highest for Lough Owennamarve and lowest for Lough Meela and intermediate for the other two lakes. Lough Meela had the highest values for the Simpson's dominance index and the Berger-Parker index. Lough Owennamarve had the highest Brillouin's index and Lough Meela had the lowest. The use of multiple regression techniques to control for the potentially confounding effect of geographical distance as a predictor of community similarity was discussed. No parasite species found could be considered as regionally and locally abundant and therefore described as a core species. The helminth community appears to have some degree of predictability, but chance colonization events are also important.

J	Wright, RJ; DeVries, TA								Species composition and relative abundance of coccinellidae (Coleoptera) in South Central Nebraska field crops								JOURNAL OF THE KANSAS ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY				73	2			103	111					APR 2000	2000	Species composition and relative abundance of adult Coccinellidae were monitored in field corn (Zea mays L.), grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench.), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) in south central Nebraska during 1992-1995. Two native coccinellids, Hippodamia convergens Guerin-Meneville and Coleomegilla maculata (DeGeer), were the most common species during all years and in all crops, comprising >77% of the individuals observed. Averaged over all years, H. convergens was the most common species in alfalfa and sorghum, and C. maculata was the most common species in corn and wheat. Other species collected included Coccinella septempunctata (L.), Hippodamia parenthesis (Say), Hippodamia tredecimpunctata tibialis (Say) and Cycloneda munda (Say). Although there was variation in species composition by crop and year there were no significant differences in species diversity as measured by the Berger-Parker species dominance index (d) and the Shannon-Weaver function (H). This information will help target future studies in conservation, augmentation and classical biological control involving coccinellids.

J	Campos-Vázquez, C; Carrera-Parra, LF; González, NE; Salazar-Vallejo, SI								Rock cryptofauna in Punta Nizuc, Mexican Caribbean and its use as a potential biomonitor								REVISTA DE BIOLOGIA TROPICAL				47	4			799	808					DEC 1999	1999	To complete the environmental quality assesment of Isla Mujeres-Cancun-Nizuc National Marine Park, the potential of rock cryptofauna as impact monitor was considered. A transect was defined along a visitor intensity gradient and three places (1.5-4 m deep, and 50, 250 and 500 m from the tourist platform); in each. Inte three rocks were collected. The variations in abundance and biomass along an environmental gradient, and the relationship among diversity and dominance with the distance from the platform, density of rocks and depth were studied. Indices based on log10 (biomass + 1), and abundance-biomass curves were used to determine environmental quality. The Bray-Curtis index and the Jaccard coefficient were used to find affinities between stations. To evaluate the functionality of "taxonomic sufficiency in coral bottom, the Berger-Parker indices for species and families were compared. Among the 1368 organisms found, the groups with higher specific richness were polychaetes (64 spp.), mollusks (46 spp.) and crustaceans (36 spp.). We identified a highly stressed environment near to the platform (low diversity, ABC curve). The trend is not associated with depth (although there are increases) or rock density. Mollusk or crustacean biomass had not tendency; polychaete biomass is promissory but more evaluations are required. The cluster analysis separated rocks collected near the platform (stressed environment) from the rest. Comparison of the Berger-Parker index using species or families showed similar curves but work at family level increases differences between rocks from the same place: there is a loss of useful information when higher taxa are used.

J	Seymour, CL; Dean, WRJ								Effects of heavy grazing on invertebrate assemblages in the Succulent Karoo, South Africa								JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS				43	3			267	286		10.1006/jare.1999.0552			NOV 1999	1999	Invertebrate assemblages occurring on Paulshoek, a heavily grazed communal farm in Namaqualand, South Africa, were compared to those found on adjacent, moderately grazed farms. The study was conducted at three sites on the communal farm, each bordering a different commercially managed farm. Results of pitfall trapping and Berger-Parker dominance indices showed that invertebrate abundance was consistently higher in the heavily grazed areas. Species richness was greater on the moderately grazed areas at two of the three sites, while Shannon diversity was higher at all three moderately grazed localities. Cluster analysis, multidimensional scaling and ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) pointed to considerable differences in invertebrate assemblages where habitat degradation was severe. Invertebrate diversity decreased sharply with decreasing total and perennial plant cover. Dominance indices, on the other hand, tended to increase in response to decreasing vegetation cover. Greater invertebrate abundance in severely degraded areas may compound the effects of overgrazing, because further degradation of habitat may hinder recruitment by palatable perennials.

J	ColungaGarcia, M; Gage, SH; Landis, DA								Response of all assemblage of Coccinellidae (Coleoptera) to a diverse agricultural landscape								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				26	4			797	804		10.1093/ee/26.4.797			AUG 1997	1997	Changes in species assemblages of predatory coccinellids in response to landscape structure (habitat diversity and patchiness) was studied in a southern Michigan landscape during 1989-1990. Three sites with different mosaics of cultivated (alfalfa, corn, wheat) and uncultivated (deciduous, field succession) habitats were sampled for coccinellid species using yellow sticky traps. The landscape at each site was characterized using the Berger-Parker index for habitat diversity and a relative patchiness index for habitat fragmentation. Relative abundance, species richness, species dominance, and the Kendall coefficient were used to analyze and compare species assemblages among sites. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to extract factor components per species and site scores, which were compared with landscape indices using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Thirteen species of coccinellids were captured during the 2 yr of weekly sampling. Of these species, Coccinella septempunctata (L.) was the dominant species in the landscape and was equally abundant in the 3 sites. Coleomegilla maculata lengi Timberlake was more abundant in the site that had a corn habitat, whereas Cycloneda munda (Say), Chilocorus stigma (Say), and Brachiacantha ursina (F.) were more abundant in the site that had a deciduous habitat. Overall, the site with a deciduous habitat had higher species richness. There were significant differences in species composition between the site with a deciduous habitat and the other 2 sites. Differences observed among sites were significantly correlated with the presence of uncultivated habitats in the landscape.

J	Pettersson, RB								Effect of forestry on the abundance and diversity of arboreal spiders in the boreal spruce forest								ECOGRAPHY				19	3			221	228		10.1111/j.1600-0587.1996.tb00230.x			SEP 1996	1996	Spiders were sampled from spruce branches during late winter in northern Sweden, to investigate the effects of forestry on the community structure of al boreal spiders. Five lichen-rich, natural spruce Picea abies forests and adjacent mature, selectively-logged lichen-poor forests were selected as sample sites. Lichen-rich forests had over three times more spiders on the branches than the lichen-poor forests. The spider community was dominated by web spinners, i.e. the Families Limyphiidae, Araneidae, Tetragnathidae and Theridiidae. Hunters, i.e. Philodromidae and Clubionidae, comprised <3% of the individuals and >82% of all spiders were juveniles. Among the dominant species. only the orb-weaver Araneus nordmanni was found in all sites whereas the sheet-web spider Lepthyphantes suffusus was found in all Ave lichen-rich forests but only in two of the lichen-poor. Both species composition and dominance differed from spider communities in southern boreal spruce canopies. Small pr ey items, severe abiotic conditions and high predation pressure from birds are possible reasons why web spiders dominate the arboreal community in northern Sweden. These factors could also explain the observed shift in dominance From sheet-web spiders with large body size to those with a small body size, compared with arboreal spider communities in southern boreal forests. Diversity indices (jack-knifing of Simpson index and Q statistic) showed a higher diversity of spiders in lichen-rich than in lichen-poor forests. The richen-rich forest had more species and less dominance, in both rank abundance and the Berger-Parker index of dominance. However, rarefraction plots indicated no differences besides lower abundance of spiders on sampled branches in lichen-poor forests. It is suggested, that habitat structure (branch size and epiphytic lichen abundance) could be an explanation for the greater number of spiders in old, lichen-rich spruce forests.

Three types of simulations generated variations in communities that could be expected to be found in fieldwork, on rare, median and dominant taxa. Camargo index was the most sensitive to change in rare taxa and the least sensitive to change in dominant taxa. Berger-Parker and Simpson measures were strongly influenced by sample size. McIntosh and Simpson indices were strongly correlated but did not have the same sensitivity. We think that the McIntosh index is the best compromise between a strong sensitivity to dominant taxa and a lesser sensitivity to variations in the other taxa.

J	DODD, CK								BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF A TEMPORARY POND HERPETOFAUNA IN NORTH FLORIDA SANDHILLS								BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				1	3			125	142		10.1007/BF00695911			SEP 1992	1992	From 1985 through 1990, the herpetofauna of a temporary pond in an uplands longleaf pine sandhills community in north-central Florida was monitored. A drift fence completely encircled the pond. Animals were captured in pitfall traps and marked as they entered and exited the pond basin. I captured 16 155 individuals of 42 species (16 amphibians, 26 reptiles). The species richness, diversity (using Margalef's Diversity Index) and dominance (using the Berger-Parker Index) varied among years. Between 62.5% and 87.5% of the amphibian species and 65% to 81% of the reptile species were captured in any one year. Daily amphibian capture was positively correlated with rainfall, whereas reptile capture was either not correlated or weakly negatively correlated with rainfall. Hydroperiod duration was not correlated with the numbers of either amphibians or reptiles captured. Neither the amphibian nor the reptile community showed any trends in diversity or dominance indices during the course of the study, although both communities were dominated by a few species. However, the species responsible for community dominance changed somewhat as the study progressed. Assessing the results of this study is hampered by the lack of comparable studies elsewhere, expected natural fluctuations of amphibian populations, and a prolonged drought, especially during the latter stages of the study. The herpetological community at Breezeway Pond does not appear to follow theoretical predictions of community response to stress. Temporary ponds are important centres of herpetofaunal biodiversity in uplands sandhills communities. Long-term studies are needed to monitor the composition, structure, and functional interactions of their resident species.
