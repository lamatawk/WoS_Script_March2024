J	Guiasu, RC; Guiasu, S				Guiasu, RC; Guiasu, S			Conditional and weighted measures of ecological diversity	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS												Shannon's entropy and Simpson's index are the most used measures of species diversity. As the Simpson index proves to be just an approximation of the Shannon entropy, conditional Simpson indices of diversity and a global measure of interdependence among species axe introduced, similar to those used in the corresponding entropic formalism from information theory. Also, since both the Shannon entropy and the Simpson index depend only on the number and relative abundance of the respective species in a given ecosystem, the paper generalizes these indices of diversity to the case when a numerical weight is attached to each species. Such a weight could reflect supplementary information about the absolute abundance, the economic significance, or the conservation value of the species.																			0218-4885	1793-6411				JUN	2003	11	3					283	300		10.1142/S0218488503002089	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218488503002089													WOS:000184308200002

These index use individual proportion number of species for diversity index result. For one place analysis of diversity, it is not sufficient to descript the level of diversity, because of no range of diversity level. In order to get more perfect result, it is proposed to use Simpson diversity index as published in Krebs (1985); because the formula gave 0 - 1 range index, where the highest diversity represented by 1. And on perfection of these formula, it is proposed to use importance value data, alternatively for species proportion. Importance value represent the dominance of species ecologically, because it come from species existence frequency, species individual number,and species coverage on land. We could call these formula as Simpson and Marisa index of diversity for vegetation.																					978-1-84626-024-7				2010							189	192																WOS:000284085300036

Effects of Organic Farming on Winter Plant Composition, Cover and Diversity in Olive Grove Ecosystems in Central Greece	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												The present study aimed to assess the effects of organic farming in comparison with conventional on plant composition, plant cover (%), diversity [species richness, Shannon, Simpson, and evenness (Pielou's) indexes] and investigate and describe the relations among plant species richness, plant cover, indexes, and soil parameters (pH and temperature) in olive grove ecosystems during the winter. Organic olive groves had significantly greater values of cover, species richness, and Shannon and Simpson indexes than the conventional ones. Plant species richness was positively correlated to plant cover and Shannon and Simpson indexes but negatively correlated to evenness index for both farming system. Finally, plant cover was positively correlated to the Shannon and Simpson indexes for both farming systems. According to principal component analysis (PCA), for axis 1, positive correlation was detected among the plant species richness, soil temperature, and Shannon and Simpson diversity indexes, whereas for axis 2, negative correlation was detected between plant cover and soil pH. It can be concluded that the organic management system enhances herbaceous plant cover and diversity (species richness, Shannon and Simpson indexes) in olive grove ecosystems during the winter.

Field sampling was conducted from 10-17 November 2009 at three sites namely Lata Bujang A (trail to Sungai Besar), Lata Bujang B (trail to Perlok), and Kongsi China. The beetles were sampled using six light traps, six Malaise traps and 75 pitfall traps. Three hundred forty eight beetle specimens comprising 113 species from 34 families were collected from all three sites. Lata Bujang A had the most abundant (Margalef index, 11.031) and speciose (Simpson diversity index, 0.963; Shannon-Weaver index, 3.523) beetle fauna, whereas Kongsi China had the least abundant (Margalef index, 8.296) and least diverse (Simpson diversity index, 0.891; Shannon-Weaver index, 2.902) fauna.The most abundant and speciose beetle family caught was the leaf beetle Chrysomelidae (Simpson diversity index, 0.971; Shannon-Weaver index, 2.507). Gunung Benom showed high abundance and diverse (Margalef index, 19.138; Simpson diversity index, 0.939; Shannon-Weaver index, 3.728) beetle fauna being an undisturbed and well preserved forest.

J	Izsák, J; Papp, L				Izsak, Janos; Papp, Laszlo			Application of the quadratic entropy indices for diversity studies of drosophilid assemblages	ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL STATISTICS												Most diversity indices widely used in ecology (e. g. the Shannon-Wiener index and the Gini-Simpson index) do not reflect taxonomic or other differences among species. Quadratic entropy, proposed by C. R. Rao (1982), takes these differences into account. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the application of this diversity index in investigations of drosophilid species diversity. Quadratic entropy and Simpson index values are also compared. The elements of the difference matrix in the quadratic form are taxonomic differences (distances) among the species. The difference is defined by the position of the lowest-ranking taxon containing both species. According to the results, the Gini-Simpson index and the taxonomic quadratic entropy are positively correlated. The observed differences are due to the fact that assemblages with greater taxonomic distances produce greater quadratic entropy. Drosophilid species can be assigned to specific life habit classes, more specifically to resource types. After postulating differences between the types, we used the quadratic entropy measure to analyse resource diversity. These kinds of examinations approximate to an operative association of species diversity and environmental diversity.																			1352-8505	1573-3009				SEP	1995	2	3					213	221		10.1007/BF00456668	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00456668													WOS:000208905800005
J	Mosler, K				Mosler, K.			Multidimensional indices and orders of diversity	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												This paper presents several indices to describe multivariate diversity and evenness. Multivariate generalizations of the Gini-Simpson index and the Rosenbluth index are proposed to measure diversity. A multivariate Gini ratio is also presented to measure evenness. These indices extend the usual univariate measures; they reflect not only the diversity of marginal distributions but also the dependence structure of abundance. The indices fulfill desirable measurement properties and are consistent with certain orderings of multivariate distributions. An order of concentration surfaces and a majorization order are also surveyed shortly.																			1585-8553	1588-2756				JUN	2001	2	2					137	143		10.1556/ComEc.2.2001.2.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/ComEc.2.2001.2.1													WOS:000558874400001

J	Guiasu, RC; Guiasu, S				Guiasu, Radu Cornel; Guiasu, Silviu			NEW MEASURES FOR COMPARING THE SPECIES DIVERSITY FOUND IN TWO OR MORE HABITATS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF UNCERTAINTY FUZZINESS AND KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS												Both the weighted entropy, which generalized the Shannon entropy, and the weighted quadratic index, which generalizes the Gini-Simpson index, are used for getting a unified treatment of some diversity measures proposed recently in ecology. The weights may reflect the ecological importance, rarity, or economic value of the species from a given habitat. The weighted measures, being concave functions, may be used in the additive partition of diversity. The weighted quadratic index has a special advantage over the weighted entropy because its maximum value has a simple analytical formula which allows us to introduce a normed measure of dissimilarity between habitats. A special case of weighted quadratic index is the Rich-Gini-Simpson index which, unlike the Shannon entropy and the classic Gini-Simpson index, behaves well when the number of species is very large. The weighted entropy and the weighted quadratic index may also be used to measure the global diversity among the subsets of species, based on the phylogenetic distance between species, is obtained as a particular case and is generalized to measure the diversity among the triads of species as well.																			0218-4885	1793-6411				DEC	2010	18	6					691	720		10.1142/S0218488510006763	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218488510006763													WOS:000284614000002

J	Gorelick, R				Gorelick, Root			Combining richness and abundance into a single diversity index using matrix analogues of Shannon's and Simpson's indices	ECOGRAPHY												Shannon's and Simpson's indices have been the most widely accepted measures of ecological diversity for the past fifty years, even though neither statistic accounts for species abundances across geographic locales ("patches"). An abundant species that is endemic to a single patch can be as much of a conservation concern as a rare cosmopolitan species. I extend Shannon's and Simpson's indices to simultaneously account for species richness and relative abundances - i.e. extend them to multispecies metacommunities - by making the inputs to each index a matrix, rather than a vector. The Shannon's index analogue of diversity is mutual entropy of species and patches divided by marginal entropy of the individual geographic patches. The Simpson's index analogue of diversity is a modification of mutual entropy, with the logarithm moved to the outside of the summation, divided by Simpson's index of the patches. Both indices are normalized for number of patches, with the result being inversely proportional to biodiversity. These methods can be extended to account for time-series of such matrices and average age-classes of each species within each patch, as well as provide a measure of spatial coherence of communities.																			0906-7590					AUG	2006	29	4					525	530		10.1111/j.0906-7590.2006.04601.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.0906-7590.2006.04601.x													WOS:000240733600007

Assessing street tree diversity in four Ohio communities using the weighted Simpson index	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Diversity is a key factor which should be considered during planning street replacements and involves assessment of existing street population for various factors especially resistance of trees to pests. Street tree replacement histories in the United States reveal extensive replacement of American elms killed by Dutch elm disease (DED) with maples, or ashes. In turn, these trees are now under attack by Asian longhorn beetle (ALB) and emerald ash borer (EAB). Two commonly used evaluation measure of diversity namely the 10:20:30 rule and the Simpson index takes into account only the number and evenness of the taxa in a street tree population. However these indexes fail to consider the differential functional values of trees which are critical in building a sustainable urban forest while attempting to increase diversity. The proposed weighted Simpson index which weights the absolute abundance of tree taxa based on some functional variable could be used as a guide to identify areas of focus for a community. A case study involving four communities in Ohio namely Toledo, Westerville, Dublin and Yellow Springs was conducted to examine the usefulness of the weighted Simpson Index. Three functional variables including environmental benefits, pest vulnerability and taxon adaptability at three different taxonomic levels, family, genus and species, were used to arrive at the weighted Simpson indexes for the four communities. Results revealed the usefulness of weighted Simpson Index in exposing areas of concern for each community. Generally all the four communities were lacking larger statured trees with greater environmental benefits. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

There are two important elements in the generalization: (1) Simpson's diversity index is extended to populations with infinite species: (2) weighting schemes are incorporated. A class of unbiased estimators for the generalized Simpson's biodiversity indices is proposed. Asymptotic normality is established for the estimators. Both the unbiasedness and the asymptotic normality of the estimators hold for all three cases of the number of species in the population: infinite, finite and known, and finite but unknown. In the case of a population with a finite number of species, known or unknown, it is also established that the proposed estimators are uniformly minimum variance unbiased and are asymptotically efficient.

J	Itô, Y				Ito, Yosiaki			Recommendations for the use of species diversity indices with reference to a recently published article as an example	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												There are some recommendations for the use of species diversity indices in a paper recently published in this journal by M. Ohsawa on the species richness and composition of weevils in five forest types in the middle region of Japan. Because several factors, such as small sample size, calculation of Simpson's diversity index by the use of the original equation of Simpson's measure of concentration D, and a weak point in the Shannon-Wiener diversity index H', may have led to biased estimates, I recalculated these indices using combined species diversity values of the five forest types. As the general tendencies of 1-D and H' values calculated here were similar to those in Ohsawa's paper, there is no need to propose any change to his view. However, these recalculated diversity indices indicated that they are values which are more suitable for use. It should be noted that the characteristics and weak point associated with the diversity indices need to be taken into account in future studies.																			0912-3814	1440-1703				JUL	2007	22	4					703	705		10.1007/s11284-006-0057-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11284-006-0057-1													WOS:000247638400022

The aims of our study were to compare the efficacy and sensitivity to community diversity measures between Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index. Tree census data from a 5-ha sample plot was partitioned into 3 datasets by diameter class to represent 3 distinct woody plant communities for the characterization of diversity across communities. The 5-ha sample plot of the forest had a total abundance of 23,301 treestems >= 1 cm DBH and a richness of 139 species. The majority of tree stems were seedlings (41.1%) and saplings (38.8%), whereas canopy trees only accounted for 20.1% of the total tree stems. Both Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's diversity index decreased significantly in response to a decrease in the N: S ratio across the datasets, but Shannon-Wiener index was more sensitive to plot-based richness changes and had a higher efficacy in predicting changes in species richness. Our findings are contrary to the general belief that Shannon-Wiener index is an insensitive measure of the character of the N: S relationship and have demonstrated that it remains a good measure for species diversity in plant community studies for its sensitivity and efficacy. We also suggest that the kurtosis statistic can be used as a new diversity measure due to its sensitivity to diversity change.					qi, li/JFE-7167-2023; Wang, Zhonglin/JVZ-9007-2024														0556-3321	2070-3368				AUG	2017	49	4					1373	1379																WOS:000412623400020

Assessment of diversity indices for the characterization of the soil prokaryotic community by metagenomic analysis	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												The diversity indices used in ecology for assessing the metagenomes of soil prokaryotic communities at different phylogenetic levels were compared. The following indices were considered: the number of detected taxa and the Shannon, Menhinick, Margalef, Simpson, Chao1, and ACE indices. The diversity analysis of the prokaryotic communities in the upper horizons of a typical chernozem (Haplic Chernozem (Pachic)), a dark chestnut soil (Haplic Kastanozem (Chromic)), and an extremely arid desert soil (Endosalic Calcisol (Yermic)) was based on the analysis of 16S rRNA genes. The Menhinick, Margalef, Chao1, and ACE indices gave similar results for the classification of the communities according to their diversity levels; the Simpson index gave good results only for the high-level taxa (phyla); the best results were obtained with the Shannon index. In general, all the indices used showed a decrease in the diversity of the soil prokaryotes in the following sequence: chernozem > dark chestnut soil > extremely arid desert soil.

J	MAGNUSSEN, S; BOYLE, TJB				MAGNUSSEN, S; BOYLE, TJB			ESTIMATING SAMPLE-SIZE FOR INFERENCE ABOUT THE SHANNON-WEAVER AND THE SIMPSON INDEXES OF SPECIES-DIVERSITY	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												A framework for a priori estimation of the expected sampling variances of the Shannon-Weaver and the Simpson indices of species diversity is developed by the introduction of the most probable relative species abundance distribution (MOPSAD). MOPSAD gives the prior probability of a species' relative abundance. The beta distribution is used here as the prior for MOPSAD. Sample sizes needed for efficient statistical inference and hypothesis testing about the two indices are provided for 16 distinct beta priors for MOPSAD. Shannon-Weaver and Simpson's diversity indices in plant communities expected to have a 'U'-shaped or a J-shaped MOPSAD will have large sampling variances. For the same statistical resolution the Simpson index requires about nine times as many samples as the Shannon-Weaver index. The impact of a positive or negative spatial association among species on the variance of the diversity indices was also assessed. In general, spatial association had little impact on the variance of the indices; it suffices to increase the sample size by about 5% as a safeguard against variance inflation due to spatial associations.						magnussen, steen/0000-0002-5655-768X													0378-1127	1872-7042				OCT	1995	78	1-3					71	84		10.1016/0378-1127(95)03596-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0378-1127(95)03596-1													WOS:A1995TJ78800006
J	Keylock, CJ				Keylock, CJ			Simpson diversity and the Shannon-Wiener index as special cases of a generalized entropy	OIKOS												Many indices for measuring species diversity have been proposed. In this article, a link is noted between a common family of diversity indices and non-additive statistical mechanics. This makes the Shannon index and the Simpson diversity (or Gini coefficient) special cases of a more general index.

Choosing and using diversity indices: insights for ecological applications from the German Biodiversity Exploratories	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Biodiversity, a multidimensional property of natural systems, is difficult to quantify partly because of the multitude of indices proposed for this purpose. Indices aim to describe general properties of communities that allow us to compare different regions, taxa, and trophic levels. Therefore, they are of fundamental importance for environmental monitoring and conservation, although there is no consensus about which indices are more appropriate and informative. We tested several common diversity indices in a range of simple to complex statistical analyses in order to determine whether some were better suited for certain analyses than others. We used data collected around the focal plant Plantago lanceolata on 60 temperate grassland plots embedded in an agricultural landscape to explore relationships between the common diversity indices of species richness (S), Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's diversity (D-1), Simpson's dominance (D-2), Simpson's evenness (E), and Berger-Parker dominance (BP). We calculated each of these indices for herbaceous plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aboveground arthropods, belowground insect larvae, and P.lanceolata molecular and chemical diversity. Including these trait-based measures of diversity allowed us to test whether or not they behaved similarly to the better studied species diversity. We used path analysis to determine whether compound indices detected more relationships between diversities of different organisms and traits than more basic indices. In the path models, more paths were significant when using H', even though all models except that with E were equally reliable. This demonstrates that while common diversity indices may appear interchangeable in simple analyses, when considering complex interactions, the choice of index can profoundly alter the interpretation of results. Data mining in order to identify the index producing the most significant results should be avoided, but simultaneously considering analyses using multiple indices can provide greater insight into the interactions in a system.

Whereas the steady-state structure is well understood, results about the dynamical aspects of the model are scarce. Here we derive dynamical equations for the Simpson diversity index. Both mean and variance of the diversity are proven to satisfy stable linear system dynamics. We show that in the stationary limit we indeed recover previous results, and we supplement this with numerical simulations to validate the dynamical part of our analytical computations. These findings are especially relevant for experiments in microbial ecology, where the Simpson diversity index can be accurately measured as a function of time. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

J	Thukral, AK; Bhardwaj, R; Kumar, V; Sharma, A				Thukral, Ashwani Kumar; Bhardwaj, Renu; Kumar, Vinod; Sharma, Anket			New indices regarding the dominance and diversity of communities, derived from sample variance and standard deviation	HELIYON												Dominance and diversity are important characteristics for the description of communities. The most commonly used indices are Simpson's dominance indexand Shannon's and Simpson's indices of diversity. This paper uses the basic concepts of statistics as applied to community analysis to develop new dominance and diversity indices that will enable scientists to establish correlations among various indices. The present study proves that the variance of the number of individuals of different species in a sample can be used to calculateSimpson's dominance and diversity indices. New indices have been developed from the ratios ofthe variance to number of species, and the mean number of individuals per species in a quadrat. A wide range of data, varying from high dominance to high evenness, was simulated for 25 quadrats, with each quadrat having ten species and 100 individuals in different combinations. Variance and standard deviation-based indices were computed using the simulated data and were found to be highly correlated with Simpson's and Shannon's indices. The proposed indices will give both the dominance and diversity of a community on the same scale based on the same statistic. Another important contribution of the present study relates to the variance of a sample consisting of a single value. It has been proved that the variance of a sample having only one value is equal to the square of that value. The paper establishes a new link between diversity studies and statistics.

The Shannon and Simpson indices are for describing one community, and the Jaccard and Morisita indices are for comparing two communities. Only a few indices allow the simultaneous comparison of three or more communities. In this study, we propose a multiple-community similarity index based on a probabilistic approach, and compare it with other multiple-community indices. Empirical examples are considered as a demonstration of the proposed similarity indices.																			0361-0918	1532-4141					2016	45	4					1307	1317		10.1080/03610918.2013.827715	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03610918.2013.827715													WOS:000374928800013
J	He, FL; Hu, XS				He, FL; Hu, XS			Hubbell's fundamental biodiversity parameter and the Simpson diversity index	ECOLOGY LETTERS												Central to Hubbell's neutral theory of biodiversity is a universal, dimensionless fundamental biodiversity parameter that is the product of community size and speciation rate. One of the most important discoveries of Hubbell's theory is that the species-abundance distribution and the species-area relationship of the neutral metacommunity is completely determined by this fundamental biodiversity parameter, although the diversity patterns of the local community are collectively determined by the biodiversity parameter and migration. Using the relative abundance of species and following the concept of heterozygosity of population genetics, here we developed an analytical relationship between this biodiversity parameter and the well-known Simpson diversity index. This relationship helps bridge the evolutionary aspect of biodiversity to the ecological and statistical aspect of the diversity. The relationship between these two parameters suggests that diversity patterns of the metacommunity can also be equally described by the Simpson index. This relationship provides an alternative approach to interpret and estimate the fundamental biodiversity parameter for the metacommunity.																			1461-023X	1461-0248				APR	2005	8	4					386	390		10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00729.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2005.00729.x													WOS:000228020200006

A new diversity index	PHYSICAL BIOLOGY												We introduce here a new index of diversity based on consideration of reasonable propositions that such an index should have in order to represent diversity. The behaviour of the index is compared with that of the Gini-Simpson diversity index, and is found to predict more realistic values of diversity for small communities, in particular when each species is equally represented and for small communities. The index correctly provides a measure of true diversity that is equal to the species richness across all values of species and organism numbers when all species are equally represented, as well as Hill's more stringent 'doubling' criterion when they are not. In addition, a new graphical interpretation is introduced that permits a straightforward visual comparison of pairs of indices across a wide range within a parameter space based on species and organism numbers.

J	Nagendra, H				Nagendra, H			Opposite trends in response for the Shannon and Simpson indices of landscape diversity	APPLIED GEOGRAPHY												Among the most popular of metrics used to quantify landscape composition are Shannon's index, believed to emphasize the richness component of diversity, and Simpson's index, emphasizing the evenness component. These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4% for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6% for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson's index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design.

Phytoplankton composition in relation to physico-chemical parameters was monitored over 1 year period on direct CETP effluent receiving stream. This stream meets with the Bidyadhari River which flows through the coastal parts of West Bengal and meets with the Bay of Bengal. 3 distinct zones (Upstream, Effluent, and Downstream) were chosen to assess the impact of CETP effluent on receiving stream. Chlorophyceae, Cyanobacteria, Bacillariophyceae, and Euglenophyceae were shown to be dominant in phytoplankton studies. Canonical Correspondence Analysis showed Euglenophyceae was related to most polluted Effluent whereas Bacillariophyceae was closer to least polluted Upstream. Patterns of both Simpson's diversity index and Simpson's dominance index clearly indicated alteration in phytoplankton community in the Downstream after mixing of CETP effluent. In contrast to downstream, where pollution was more prevalent (COD 40 mg/dm(3)) and species diversity was lower (Simpson's diversity index 6), upstream had lower pollution levels (12 mg/dm(3)) and more species diversity (15). Discriminant Analysis also supported the above-mentioned fact. The eutrophic condition in the downstream zone is indicated by higher species dominance values (Simpson's dominance index 0.15) and rich nutrient loads.																			1995-0829	1995-0837				2023 DEC 11	2023										10.1134/S199508292401019X	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S199508292401019X		DEC 2023											WOS:001119512000001

To identify and characterize them, the number of species, as well as Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were calculated from 157 sampling quadrats (17,941 individuals sampled) while the vegetation classes were obtained from multi-spectral satellite image classification in four landscapes located in the southeast of Quintana Roo, Mexico. The mean number of species of trees, shrubs and vines as well as the mean value of the total number of species and the other two diversity indices were calculated for four vegetation classes in every one of the four landscapes. In addition, the relationships between landscape patterns metrics of patch types and diversity indices were explored. The multiple statistical analyses revealed significant predictor variables for the three diversity indices. Moreover, the shape, similarity and edge contrast metrics of patch types might serve as useful indicators for the number of species and the other two diversity variables at the landscape scale. Although the association between the three diversity indices and patch types metrics showed similar behavior, some differences were appreciated. The Shannon diversity index, with its greater sensitivity to rare species, should be considered as having a greater importance in interpretation analysis than Simpson index.

J	Luo, Y; Gong, YM				Luo, Yan; Gong, Yanming			α Diversity of Desert Shrub Communities and Its Relationship with Climatic Factors in Xinjiang	FORESTS												In the past 30 years, Northwest China has experienced a warm and humid climate increase trend. How this climate change will affect the species diversity of plant communities is a hot issue in ecological research. In this study, four alpha diversity indexes were applied in 29 shrub communities at desert sites in Xinjiang, including the Margalef index, Simpson index, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou index, to explore the relationship between the alpha diversity of the desert shrub communities and climate factors (mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP)). The species diversity indexes varied across these different desert shrub communities. Tamarix ramosissima communities had the highest Margalef index, while the Krascheninnikovia ewersmannia communities had the lowest Margalef index; T. ramosissima communities also showed the highest Simpson index and Shannon-Wiener index, but Alhagi sparsifolia communities showed the lowest Simpson index and Shannon-Wiener index. The Ephedra przewalskii communities and Karelinia caspica communities showed the highest and the lowest Pielou index, respectively. The alpha diversity indexes (except the Pielou index) of desert shrub communities had a significantly positive correlation with MAP (p < 0.05) but a non-significantly correlation with MAT (p > 0.05). These results indicate that, compared with temperature, water conditions are still a more vital climatic factor affecting the species diversity of desert shrub communities in Xinjiang, and thus, the recent "warm and humid" climate trend in Xinjiang affects the alpha diversity of desert shrub communities.

Potential plant species alpha-diversity (i.e., SRp, Shannon(p), Simpson(p) and Pielou(p): potential species richness, Shannon index, Simpson index and Pielou index, respectively) were quantified by climate data (i.e., annual temperature, precipitation and radiation) and actual plant species alpha-diversity (i.e., SRa, Shannon(a), Simpson(a) and Pielou(a): actual species richness, Shannon index, Simpson index and Pielou index, respectively) were quantified by normalized difference vegetation index and climate data. Six methods (i.e., random forest, generalized boosted regression, artificial neural network, multiple linear regression, support vector machine and recursive regression trees) were used in this study. Overall, the constructed random forest models performed the best among the six algorithms. The simulated plant species alpha-diversity based on the constructed random forest models can explain no less than 96% variation of the observed plant species alpha-diversity. The RMSE and relative biases between simulated alpha-diversity based on the constructed random forest models and observed alpha-diversity were <= 1.58 and within +/- 4.49%, respectively. Accordingly, plant species alpha-diversity can be quantified from the normalized difference vegetation index and climate data using random forest models. The random forest models of plant alpha-diversity build by this study had enough predicting accuracies, at least for alpine grassland ecosystems, Tibet. The proposed random forest models of plant alpha-diversity by this current study can help researchers to save time by abandoning plant community field surveys, and facilitate researchers to conduct studies on plant alpha-diversity over a long-term temporal scale and larger spatial scale under global change.

It describes how the estimation of species richness and diversity of moist evergreen forest is affected by (1) sampling design (simple random sampling, random cluster sampling, systematic cluster sampling, stratified cluster sampling); (2) choice of species richness estimators (number of observed species vs, non-parametric estimators) and (3) choice of diversity index (Simpson vs. Shannon). Two sites are studied: a 28-ha area situated in the Western Ghats of India and a 25-ha area located at Pasoh in Peninsular Malaysia. The results show that: (1) whatever the sampling strategy, estimates of species richness depend on sample size in these very diverse forest ecosystems which contain many rare species; (2) Simpson's diversity index reaches a stable value at low sample sizes while Shannon's index is affected more by the addition of rare species with increasing sample size; (3) cluster sampling strategies provide a good compromise between cost and statistical efficiency; (4) 300-400 sample trees grouped in small clusters (10-50 individuals) are enough to obtain unbiased and precise estimates of Simpson's index; (5) the local topography of the Western Ghats has a major influence on forest composition, the steep slopes being richer and more diverse than the ridges and gentle slopes; (6) stratified duster sampling is thus an interesting alternative to systematic cluster sampling.

In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of airborne laser scanner (ALS) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) data for modeling tree diversity indices using machine learning algorithms in the uneven-aged Hyrcanian forests of Iran. Systematic sampling was adopted for the collection of field data on 300 circular plots (0.1 ha) in the study area. Menhenick, Margalef, Simpson's heterogeneity, reciprocal of Simpson's heterogeneity, Shanon-Winer heterogeneity and Simpson's evenness indices were computed as measures of tree species diversity for each plot. Several commonly used variables were extracted from the ALS and DAP data. The results showed that the random forests (RF) algorithm produced the greatest accuracy among all machine learning algorithms. Additionally, combining ALS and DAP (ALS thorn DAP) data increased prediction accuracy compared to separate modeling (0.2-6.6% reduction in relative root mean square error). The smallest RMSE% values based on independent validation data for Menhenick, Margalef, Simpson's, reciprocal of Simpson's, Shanon-Winer heterogeneity and Simpson's evenness indices were 34.6%, 32.2%, 27.6%, 27.4%, 30.7% and 24.4%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the combination of ALS and DAP could be useful for monitoring tree species diversity in multistory stands in the north of Iran and likely also in forests with complex canopy structures and multiple tree species.

The present study makes an attempt to identify the concentration of species among tree diversity in Mahavir Swami Wildlife Sanctuary, Bundelkhand, India. Four important ecological indicator indices namely Shannon-Weiner index (H'), Simpson's diversity (D), Margalef index (SR) and Pielou's (J) indices were make the most for species diversity measurement. The research outcomes revealed that Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H/) was found to be the best index for assessing species richness while Simpson's diversity (D) index was more suited for determining species diversity. The Shannon-Weiner index value calculated for different transects not only represent the species richness but also the species evenness in each transect. The potential application of forest diversity can be used a mechanism for forest management.

J	Gregorius, HR; Gillet, EM				Gregorius, Hans-Rolf; Gillet, Elizabeth M.			Generalized Simpson-diversity	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Simpson's index of diversity equals the probability of drawing without replacement two individuals of different type from a given collection. The interpretation of its inverse as the effective number of types reflects the biological meaning of diversity as the multiformity of the collection. The effective number of types is maximal, equalling the total number of types, only if all types are uniformly distributed. Simpson's diversity thus fulfills one of the most basic conceptual criteria for diversity measures. The criterion does not, however, directly carry over to continuously varying differences between types. It is shown that the common practice of taking averages or special sums of differences cannot serve as the desired generalization. In a new approach, the probabilistic interpretation of Simpson's index is used to extend the basic criterion of diversity to arbitrary differences between types, thereby retaining the concept of effective number. By considering rho as the resolution at which differences between individuals distinguish them, we define diversity as the probability D(rho) of sampling without replacement two individuals that differ by more than rho. It is pointed out that this measure generalizes the classical Simpson-criterion of diversity in that it applies to any decomposition of the collection into groups, such that individuals within a group differ by at most rho and between groups by at least rho. Maximum diversity is reached if all groups are of equal size. This maximum property of the new measure motivates definition of the effective number of types at resolution rho independently of any particular decomposition into groups and while maintaining the basic diversity criterion. The advantages of and new insights to be derived from this scale-free measure are demonstrated by suggesting an approach to beta-diversity in ecology that is consistent with the criterion of diversity and by providing a worked example in population genetics using multiple-loci microsatellite data from three wild cherry populations. The example shows that gene associations may strongly affect the ranking of populations for genetic diversity. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Data were obtained from a three-year-study (2008-2010) of ground beetle associations of different sized hedges in the agricultural landscape near Stuttgart (Germany). The results of the four indices used were very similar. While alpha- and gamma-diversity decreased in small hedgerows, an increase of beta was observed. This may be explained by the influence of different adjacent crops. Neglectance of rare species is one of the main disadvantages of these diversity measures, because this results in an underestimation of species richness in large hedgerows.

Physiochemical parameters of water, grain size analysis and percentage total organic matter (TOM) of sediment were assessed during four seasons. Hence, the samples of benthic macroinvertebrate and sediment were obtained from fifteen sites along the Bahrekan Bay, from November 2008 to August 2009. The diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates in fifteen sites was calculated. Also, the differences between physico-chemical parameters of sea water, percentage TOM and grain size of sediment and diversity indices were determined (P = 0.05). The diversity of all stations was compared with each other in each season. The correlation coefficients of all above parameters were determined. The highest diversity was obtained in winter (Simpsson index: 0.13 +/- 0.01, H': 3.47 +/- 0.06) and the lowest diversity was obtained in autumn (Simpson index: 0.16 +/- 0.01, H': 3.17 +/- 0.06). The annual mean of Simpson diversity index was 0.15 +/- 0.04 which indicated that macrobenthose in Bahrekan bay have a good variation. The results of Shanon-Wiener, Brilluin and N1 (number of equally common species) indices confirmed the results of Simpson index. In stations where diversity had little fluctuations based on N1 index, the degree of the fluctuations were more recognizable. At stations near the shoreline, the diversity indices was categorized as moderate pollution (H': 1 - 3) due to the fishing activities.

Although there are several commonly used indices, each has shortcomings and all vary in the relative emphasis they place on the number of species and their relative abundance. We propose utilizing Fisher Information, not as a replacement for existing indices, but as a supplement to other indices because it is sensitive to community structure. We demonstrate how Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices quantify the diversity of two different systems and how Fisher Information can enhance the analyses by comparing, as example, body size, and phylogenetic diversity of the different communities. Fisher Information is sensitive to the order in which species are entered into the analysis, and therefore, it can detect differences in community structure. Thus, the Fisher Information index can be useful in helping understand and analyze biodiversity of ecosystems and in comparing ecological communities. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Simultaneous confidence intervals for comparing biodiversity indices estimated from overdispersed count data	BIOMETRICAL JOURNAL												Diversity indices might be used to assess the impact of treatments on the relative abundance patterns in species communities. When several treatments are to be compared, simultaneous confidence intervals for the differences of diversity indices between treatments may be used. The simultaneous confidence interval methods described until now are either constructed or validated under the assumption of the multinomial distribution for the abundance counts. Motivated by four example data sets with background in agricultural and marine ecology, we focus on the situation when available replications show that the count data exhibit extra-multinomial variability. Based on simulated overdispersed count data, we compare previously proposed methods assuming multinomial distribution, a method assuming normal distribution for the replicated observations of the diversity indices and three different bootstrap methods to construct simultaneous confidence intervals for multiple differences of Simpson and Shannon diversity indices. The focus of the simulation study is on comparisons to a control group. The severe failure of asymptotic multinomial methods in overdispersed settings is illustrated. Among the bootstrap methods, the widely known Westfall-Young method performs best for the Simpson index, while for the Shannon index, two methods based on stratified bootstrap and summed count data are preferable. The methods application is illustrated for an example.																			0323-3847	1521-4036				MAR	2013	55	2					246	263		10.1002/bimj.201200157	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/bimj.201200157								23401312					WOS:000316086100008

This paper assesses the effects of agricultural policy on changes in the diversity of agricultural landscapes in Slovenia. Diversity is measured by the Shannon index and the Simpson index, while the impacts were estimated using a spatial lag model. The results show that direct payments decrease landscape diversity by 2 index points per 1 000 EUR/ha, but agri-environmental payments for reducing negative impacts on the environment and those for nature conservation increase agricultural landscape diversity by 2.8 index points and 12.30 index points per 1 000 EUR/ha, respectively. Furthermore, we did not find any statistically significant effects of habitat protection payments on landscape diversity. Since direct payments are almost four times larger on average as agri-environmental payments, they preserve landscape diversity only to a limited extent.

J	Campos, D; Isaza, JF				Campos, Diogenes; Fernando Isaza, Jose			A geometrical index for measuring species diversity	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												During the past decades several biodiversity indices have been proposed and employed in ecological literature. Although each one has been partially justified on practical or quasi-theoretical grounds, recommendations of ecological theorists differ from describing which index to use. The goal of this article is to introduce a new index for measuring biological diversity that is sensitive to the number of different species (species richness, S), and the relative abundance of them. We take advantage from the mathematical relation between Simpson index and the geometrical concept of a S-dimensional sphere of radius r, where r is the square root of the Simpson index. Full applications of the method are developed, first with hypothetical communities and then with real data for 1761 specimens of 82 weevil species collected in several forest types [Ohsawa, M., 2005.

Numerous methods have been developed for building species habitat suitability models. The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of Pleiades satellite data for modeling tree species diversity of Hyrcanian forests in northern Iran (Mazandaran Province). One-hundred sample plots were established over an area of 2,600 ha and surveyed for tree diversity, and the Simpson's index (D), Shannon's index (H') and the reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D) were calculated for each plot. Spectral variables and several parameters derived by texture analysis were obtained from multispectral images of the study area and used as predictors of tree diversity of sample plots. Two different methods, including generalized additive models (GAMs) and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), were used for modeling. The results revealed a fairly good prediction of plot tree diversity obtained using the developed models (adj-R-2 = 0.542-0.731). Shannon's H' and Simpson's 1/D indices were more accurately predicted using GAM-based methods, while MARS models were more suitable for predicting Simpson's D. We concluded that Pleiades satellite data can be conveniently used for estimating, assessing and monitoring tree species diversity in the mixed hardwood Hyrcanian forest of northern Iran.																			1971-7458					FEB	2017	10						348	352		10.3832/ifor1884-009	http://dx.doi.org/10.3832/ifor1884-009													WOS:000395862000048

Next. the texture of each region is described using the Simpson's Diversity Index, which is used in Ecology to measure the biodiversity of an ecosystem. Finally, the information of texture is used by SVM to classify the suspicious regions into two classes: masses and nonmasses.

The objective of the study was to find out the number of species of the family and to mark the distribution of the species of the family Vespidae in various locations of the study area. The wasps were collected with the help of hand net through active search, killed with insecticide and preserved in insect boxes having naphthalene balls as preservatives. Species richness were calculated using Margalef and Menhinick indices while species diversity was calculated using Simpson diversity index. The most abundant subfamily was Polistinae with 65% abundance while the least abundant was the Eumeninae with 2% abundance. However, the most diverse and species rich subfamily is Eumeninae with a Simpson (1-D) value of 0.803, Menhinick and Margalef indices values of 1.540 and 2.543, respectively. Among the seven tehsils, Kabal is the most species rich and diverse having Margalef value 2.408, Menhinick Value 0.514 and Simpson (1-D) value 0.777 while Bahrain is the least species rich and having no diversity. The Margalef, Menhinick and Simpson (1-D) values for tehsil Bahrain are 0, 0.333, and 0, respectively. The Polistinae is the dominant subfamily in the area and can be used as biocontrol agent for various pests of agricultural importance.																			1513-1874					OCT	2018	44	5					319	324		10.2306/scienceasia1513-1874.2018.44.319	http://dx.doi.org/10.2306/scienceasia1513-1874.2018.44.319													WOS:000455238800003

However, these entropy indices are based on abundance of the species only and they do not take differences between the species into consideration. Rao's quadratic entropy has found many applications in different fields including ecology. Further, the quadratic entropy (QE) index is the only ecological diversity index that reflects both the differences and abundances of the species. The problem of testing of hypothesis of the equality of QEs is formulated as a problem of comparing practical equivalence intervals. Simulation experiments are used to compare various equivalence intervals.

Many previous methods have been proposed for this task. However, previous methods do not explicitly consider the uniformity of the number of the items' classes, or evenness, which could degrade the search and recommendation quality. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method by adapting the Simpson's Diversity Index from biology, which enables a more effective and efficient quadratic search result diversification algorithm. We also extend the method to balance the diversity between multiple aspects through weighted factors and further improve computational complexity by developing a fast approximation algorithm. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method using the openly available Kaggle shoes competition dataset.

Sixteen samples of cultivated and the same number of non-cultivated soils were selected. Gel bands were identified using the GelCompar software to create the presence-absence matrix, where each band represented a bacterial operational taxonomic unit. The data were used for principal-component analysis and additionally, the Shannon-Weaver index of general diversity, Simpson index of dominance and Simpson index of diversity were calculated. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles clearly indicated differentiation of tested samples into two clusters: cultivated and non-cultivated soils. Greater numbers of dominant operational taxonomic units (65) in non-cultivated soils were noted compared to cultivated soils (47 operational taxonomic units). This implies that there was a reduction of dominant bacterial operational taxonomic units by nearly 30% in cultivated soils. Simpson dominance index expressing the number of species weighted by their abundance amounted to 1.22 in cultivated soils, whereas a 3-fold higher value (3.38) was observed in non-cultivated soils. Land-use practices seemed to be a important factors affected on biodiversity, because more than soil type determined the clustering into groups.

The Simpson's and Shannon-Wiener indices are widely used to characterize & alpha;-diversity based on species abundances within a fixed study site (e.g., a quadrat or plot). Although such indices provide overall diversity estimates that can be analyzed, their values are not spatially continuous nor applicable in theory to any point within the study region, and thus they cannot be treated as spatial covariates for analyses of other variables. Herein, we extended the Simpson's and Shannon-Wiener indices to create point estimates of & alpha;-diversity for any location based on spatially explicit species occurrences within different bandwidths (i.e., radii, with the location of interest as the center). For an arbitrary point in the study region, species occurrences within the circle plotting the bandwidth were weighted according to their distance from the center using a tri-cube kernel function, with occurrences closer to the center having greater weight than more distant ones. These novel kernel-based & alpha;-diversity indices were tested using a tree dataset from a 400 m x 400 m study region comprising a 200 m x 200 m core region surrounded by a 100-m width buffer zone. Our newly extended & alpha;-diversity indices did not disagree qualitatively with the traditional indices, and the former were slightly lower than the latter by < 2% at medium and large bandwidths. The present work demonstrates the feasibility of using kernel-based & alpha;-diversity indices to estimate diversity at any location in the study region and allows them to be used as quantifiable spatial covariates or predictors for other dependent variables of interest in future ecological studies. Spatially continuous & alpha;-diversity indices are useful to compare and monitor species trends in space and time, which is valuable for conservation practitioners.

J	Wilsey, BJ; Chalcraft, DR; Bowles, CM; Willig, MR				Wilsey, BJ; Chalcraft, DR; Bowles, CM; Willig, MR			Relationships among indices suggest that richness is an incomplete surrogate for grassland biodiversity	ECOLOGY												Although many indices estimate diversity, species richness recently has been used as a surrogate for diversity in many studies in ecology, biogeography, and conservation. Underlying assumptions of this approach are that all diversity indices, including those that weight species importance by their relative abundance (e.g., evenness), are correlated positively, and that richness accounts for a large proportion of the variance in diversity. We addressed these assumptions with data from six grassland sites using univariate and multivariate analyses of a variety of indices (species evenness, richness, rarity, dominance, and Simpson's diversity index). Univariate correlations between plant species evenness and richness were weak and negative at each site. Principal-component analyses consistently revealed two significant components of variation in diversity. Richness and evenness were largely orthogonal, with Simpson's diversity loading between them. Thus, measures of species diversity based on relative abundance, as well as richness, may be necessary to capture the full complexity of diversity in conservation studies and in experiments of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. At these and perhaps other sites, species richness was an incomplete surrogate for diversity.

Estimation of the Current Status of Floral Biodiversity at Surroundings of Integrated Industrial Estate-Pantnagar, India	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Gradual decrease of biodiversity related to the rapid industrialization and urbanization is stimulating the fundamental research towards a better understanding of the relationships between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Present study emphasizes the nature and status of floral diversity in the vicinity of Integrated Industrial Estate-Pan in agar, Uttarakhand, India (IIE-Pantnagar). Three monitoring locations were selected in the vicinity of industrial estate and data were collected to compute species richness, evenness, Importance Value Index (IVI), Shannon and Wiener Species Diversity Index and Simpson's Index of biodiversity. Cynodon dactylon was found to be major dominant species among all three monitoring locations, followed by Sorghum halepense and Parthenium sp. The Simpson's index of biodiversity varied at a range of 0.28 to 0.41, signifying the presence of less biodiversity. Species evenness, a measure of relative abundance of the different species was at a range of 0.36 to 0.46. Monitoring location outside industrial area (site-2) revealed slight higher diversity with Shannon and Wiener Species Diversity Index of 0.742 in comparison to other monitoring locations inside the industrial area. Mostly the encountered vegetation were found as invasive species, therefore, recommendations were hereby made to take precautions regarding its further spread. Development and maintenance of greenbelt in and around industrial area were also suggested.																			1735-6865	2008-2304				WIN	2010	4	1					41	48																WOS:000273827000005

As a typical karst region, the Chuanshan Town in Huanjiang Maonan Autonomous County, Guangxi was selected as the study area. Firstly, the plant species Richness Index, Simpson Index and Shannon-Wiener Index of 16 sample plots were calculated based on ground measurements. Secondly, the Difference Vegetation Index, the Enhanced Vegetation Index, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index, the Optimised Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index, the Ratio Vegetation Index and the Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index were obtained from Landsat images. Then, regression analysis was performed between the three plant diversity indices and the six vegetation indices. The results indicated that the best correlation was between the Simpson Index and the Optimised Soil-adjusted Vegetation Index (R-2 = 0.857, P < 0.01). The exponential regression model was established based on this relationship to inverse the plant diversity. The plant diversity was divided into five grades, namely, non-forest, first grade, second grade, third grade, and fourth grade. The diversity thematic map was expected to provide references for the protection of regional biodiversity.																			1311-5065						2021	22	6					2345	2352																WOS:000754649200009

We explored the effect of abiotic (climatic conditions, altitude) and biotic factors (long-term grazing by small ruminants) on the floristic composition and diversity of selected lowland (Pyrathi, Faistos) and highland (Vroulidia, Nida) rangelands. In each rangeland, the ground cover was measured, and the floristic composition was calculated in terms of five functional groups: grasses, legumes, forbs, phrygana, and shrubs. The aridity index, species turnover, species richness, Shannon entropy, and Gini-Simpson index (with the latter two converted to the effective number of species) were calculated. Our results reveal that highlands are characterized by the highest aridity index (wetter conditions). Lowland rangelands, compared to highland, exhibited a higher percentage contribution of grasses, legumes, and forbs, while species turnover decreased along the altitudinal gradient. The Shannon entropy index was correlated (a) positively with Gini-Simpson and mean annual temperature and (b) negatively with mean annual precipitation, aridity index, and altitude. Moreover, the Gini-Simpson index correlated positively with mean annual temperature and negatively with altitude. Our results could help to understand the effects of grazing on rangeland dynamics and sustainability in semi-arid regions in the context of climatic change.

The case of the Mazzarrone study area, Sicily	GEOMORPHOLOGY												Anthropogenic soils created ex novo by land-use change in large scale farming are, from a pedogenetic point of view, catastrophic events that bring the soils to time zero and change the natural pattern of the soilscape, remarkably, in some cases. The quantitative aspects of pedodiversity of a soilscape in South-East Sicily, where some types of soils, in recent decades, have suffered a consistent reduction due to the transformations by large scale farming, are considered. The evolution of pedodiversity over a 53-year period (1955 to 2008) is examined using a dedicated statistical method and a space-time model based on Markov analysis and cellular automata in order to predict the evolution of the soilscape pattern in the next 42 years (i.e. until 2050). Soil subgroups, using the USDA Soil Taxonomy and a classification proposal, were considered and the following indices were used: richness; Shannon's diversity index; Simpson diversity index; modified Simpson's diversity index; Shannon's evenness index; Simpson's evenness index and modified Simpson's evenness index. These indices measured over time, show, quantitatively, a decrease in pedodiversity that highlights the effect of the human intervention in modifying the natural order of the soilscape.

The specific questions were to examine, (1) whether there is a latitudinal gradient of regional diversity, (2) how spatial components of the regional diversity (local diversity and turnover diversity) vary with latitude depending on spatial scale, and (3) whether the latitudinal gradient differs between different measures of species diversity, i.e. species richness and Simpson's diversity index. We measured coverage and the presence or absence of all sessile organisms in a total of 150 census plots established at five shores in each of six regions. The results showed that there were clear latitudinal gradients in regional species richness and in species turnover among shores. However, these patterns were not reflected in smaller-scale local species richness. For Simpson's diversity index, there was no evidence of latitudinal clines either in regional diversity or in spatial components. These results suggest that relative abundance of common species does not vary along latitude, while the number of rare species increases with decreasing latitude.

Parchin-Pasdaran Road, which runs from the heart of Khojir National Park, is a big threat to this park. Despite these environmental threats, the development and creation of new highways is unavoidable. This research was carried out to study the effect of the road on Smith-Wilson evenness index and Simpson diversity index in Khojir National Park. The Land Management Units were created using the ArcGIS software. Using appropriate algorithm in artificial neural network structure and linear regression of species evenness and diversity was modelled. For modelling of species evenness and diversity, factors like bulk density, particle density, moisture content, porosity and distance from the road were used. Finally, considering that the amount of R-2 in artificial neural network method was statistically significant for Smith-Wilson and Simpson (0.54), (0.71) and in the regression method, respectively (0.25), (0.75), was obtained, the neural network model was selected as the optimal model. Based on the analysis of sensitivity analysis, humidity factors at 5 and 10 cm from the soil surface, the actual 5 cm particle density on the Smith-Wilson index and the porosity at 10 cm from the soil surface had the most effect on the Russian Simpson index.

In this work, we used ecological diversity indices (EDIs) with an ecosystem approach as a tool to compare the differences in ecosystem diversity among different ecoregions. After comparing five EDI at coastal and marine ecoregions on Northwestern Mexico, it is concluded that out of the five indices analyzed for ecosystem diversity, the Simpson's Inverse and Hill indices were the most sensitive ones, considering the trends of their charts, variations, and the distance between their range values, which describe ecosystem diversity more accurately among different ecoregions. However, in order to describe the richness and heterogeneity of the analyzed ecoregions, the Simpson's Inverse index was the most useful to define which of the regions have greater diversity of ecosystems in comparative studies among them, and therefore the priority to be enacted as a new Protected Natural Area.

J	Muller, K; McDermott, JM; Wolfe, MS; Limpert, E				Muller, K; McDermott, JM; Wolfe, MS; Limpert, E			Analysis of diversity in populations of plant pathogens: The barley powdery mildew pathogen across Europe	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PATHOLOGY												Understanding population genetics and evolution within species requires recognition of variation within and between populations and the ability to distinguish between the potential causes of an observed distribution of variation. For this aim several established indices of diversity, and a novel one, were applied to population samples of the barley powdery mildew pathogen, Erysiphe graminis f. sp, hordei. Random spore samples were obtained from the air along transects through regions of interest across large parts of Europe in 1990. Significant geographical differences in diversity of virulence genotypes occurred among regional sub-samples. Diversity was highest in the samples from eastern Germany, Denmark and Austria, whereas the lowest values were found in the samples from Italy, southern France and parts of western Germany. Diversity in the pathogen population was generally related to the degree of diversification of host resistance in time and space, although there was considerable variation in ranking among different measures of diversity. Sensitivity to sample size proved to be the major problem with the use of several established indices of diversity. Working with very large sample sizes we used multiple random subsamples of various smaller sizes to determine how the mean index values changed with changing sample size. The Shannon index proved to be considerably affected by sample size, in contrast to the Simpson index that was therefore used as a global measure of diversity. Limits of confidence were estimated for the Simpson index using the bootstrap method of numerical resampling. The two aspects contributing to global diversity, richness and evenness, were considered separately to allow meaningful interpretation of the Simpson index. Random sub-sampling was used to reduce the influence of sample size differences for these measures. Dissimilarity, a novel measure of diversity for use in plant pathology, indicates the average number of major genes for host resistance against which pathotypes in a sample respond differently. It is thus able to account for the genetic relationship among pathotypes, which is not considered by any other index. The approaches developed in this study help to compare major forces driving evolution of large-scale populations of the barley mildew pathogen.																			0929-1873	1573-8469				MAY	1996	102	4					385	395		10.1007/BF01878133	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF01878133													WOS:A1996UT81800009
J	Faith, JT; Du, A				Faith, J. Tyler; Du, Andrew			The measurement of taxonomic evenness in zooarchaeology	ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL SCIENCES												Zooarchaeologists frequently measure taxonomic evenness to document subsistence change and to understand the response of faunal communities to paleoenvironmental change. Although the measurement of evenness is commonplace, there are numerous challenges involved. Evenness indices are sensitive to changing richness, and by extension sample size, and various indices respond differently to changing taxonomic abundances (i.e., changing evenness). To refine protocol for comparing assemblages of varied sampling effort and identify indices that may be more useful for zooarchaeological applications, we examine the quantitative behavior of the widely used Shannon evenness and Simpson indices and two others more commonly used by ecologists. These indices are examined in relation to varied richness, sample size, and taxonomic abundances. We show that although zooarchaeologists are concerned with identifying and correcting for the effects of sample size on evenness, it may be appropriate to instead focus on how richness modulates evenness. Based on our analyses, we recommend the Simpson index for most zooarchaeological applications, except when comparing evenness across assemblages that are very even.					Faith, J.

To study fungal biodiversity in the air, a 7-day recording Hirst-type spore trap was used. The daily concentration of 124 taxa was recorded in an Italian vineyard. The predominant fungi were: Cladosporium spp., unknown 3-septate fusiform spore, and Alternaria spp. Shannon's and Simpson's biodiversity indices and evenness were calculated first for air spora. Meteorological circumstances affected the biodiversity; positive correlations were found between Simpson's biodiversity index and precipitation, but no significant correlations were found with Shannon's diversity index and evenness. To predict Simpson's index for airborne fungi, regression analysis was performed. It was shown that the best estimator, sun hours, negatively affected the index. The biodiversity of the dominant species was low on dry days, since Cladosporium alone had much higher abundance on such days than other species.

Deciphering Diversity Indices for a Better Understanding of Microbial Communities	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY AND BIOTECHNOLOGY												The past decades have been a golden era during which great tasks were accomplished in the field of microbiology, including food microbiology. In the past, culture-dependent methods have been the primary choice to investigate bacterial diversity. However, using culture-independent high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes has greatly facilitated studies exploring the microbial compositions and dynamics associated with health and diseases. These culture-independent DNA-based studies generate large-scale data sets that describe the microbial composition of a certain niche. Consequently, understanding microbial diversity becomes of greater importance when investigating the composition, function, and dynamics of the microbiota associated with health and diseases. Even though there is no general agreement on which diversity index is the best to use, diversity indices have been used to compare the diversity among samples and between treatments with controls. Tools such as the Shannon-Weaver index and Simpson index can be used to describe population diversity in samples. The purpose of this review is to explain the principles of diversity indices, such as ShannonWeaver and Simpson, to aid general microbiologists in better understanding bacterial communities. In this review, important questions concerning microbial diversity are addressed. Information from this review should facilitate evidence-based strategies to explore microbial communities.

J	Kant, S				Kant, S			The marginal cost of structural diversity of mixed uneven-aged hard maple forests	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												Theoretical concepts pertaining to the marginal cost (MC) of the structural diversity of a forest stand are developed. A matrix growth model is estimated for mixed uneven-aged forest stands of hard maple (Acer saccharum Marsh.) from southern Ontario. The estimated growth model is used to derive the MC equations for the Shannon and the Simpson indices of total structural diversity (TSD), species diversity (SD), and tree-size diversity (TD). The effects of exclusion and inclusion of the opportunity cost (OC) on the MC of the TSD are compared. The contributions of SD and TD to the MC of the TSD are disaggregated. The MCs of TSD, SD, and TD for the Shannon and the Simpson indices are iso-elastic. The elasticity of the MC of the TSD for the inclusion of OC is greater than the elasticity of MC of the TSD for the exclusion of OC. The elasticities of MC of TSD, SD, and TD for the Shannon index are greater than the elasticities of MC of TSD, SD, and TD, respectively, for the Simpson index. The elasticities of MC of SD are smaller than the elasticities of MC of TD, for both indices. However, these results are specific to the hard maple forests of southern Ontario and cannot be generalized. Some general features of MC equations of structural diversity are discussed.																			0045-5067	1208-6037				APR	2002	32	4					616	628		10.1139/X02-001	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/X02-001													WOS:000175372000005
J	Ricotta, C; Avena, GC				Ricotta, C; Avena, GC			A 'fast-food approach' to the standardization of quadratic diversity	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS												Intuitively, a community composed of ecologically dissimilar taxa is more diverse than a community composed of more similar taxa. However, since traditional diversity indices such as Shannon's entropy or Simpson's diversity are computed solely from the relative abundances of a given species assemblage, they cannot account for ecological differences between species. There have been recent developments regarding the use of quadratic entropy, a diversity index that incorporates both species relative abundances and a measure of the pairwise ecological differences between species. In this paper we firstly show that under some specific circumstances quadratic entropy can be additively decomposed into alpha- beta- and gamma-diversities, a property that renders it a desirable measure of diversity in the ecological practice. Next, we suggest a quick and simple method for obtaining a standardized version of quadratic entropy that may allow an easier interpretation of the resulting diversity values.

To date little has been done to consider the role of urban school yards in biodiversity conservation in Southern Africa. Our study therefore investigated the role of urban school yards in biodiversity conservation across an urban gradient in the city of Harare, Zimbabwe. Ten schools were randomly selected from each stratum, low, medium and high density suburbs. School yards were surveyed for herbs (garden flowers) and woody plants (trees and shrubs). For a diversity, species richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were computed using the Hill numbers. Variation in species composition among schools was assessed using beta diversity (beta(SOR)) and its components (beta(SIM) and beta(SNE)). A total of 120 tree species belonging to 43 families and 89 garden flowers belonging to 41 families were identified and recorded in school yards from the different suburb densities. Schools in medium density suburbs had highest species richness, Shannon, Simpson and beta diversity indices for indigenous trees compared with those in the low and high density suburbs. For garden flowers, there was no variation in species richness, Shannon, Simpson and beta indices across school yards from low, medium and high density suburbs. Our results demonstrate the important role of urban school yards in biodiversity conservation in general, though there is species homogenization of garden flowers and exotic trees across the urban landscape.

J	Sulehria, AQK; Malik, MA				Sulehria, Abdul Qayyum Khan; Malik, Muhammad Anwar			Diversity indices of pelagic rotifers in Camp Balloki Water Park, Lahore, Pakistan	TURKISH JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												This work attempted to evaluate the rotifer species diversity indices of Camp Balloki Water Park and infer the state of the water according to rotifers and physicochemical parameters. The diversity indices, species richness, and evenness were assessed every month. The Shannon-Weaver index indicated that this habitat had great diversity of rotifers throughout the year. These results were supported by the Simpson dominance, diversity, and reciprocal indices. Water and plankton samples were taken monthly from January 2006 to December 2006. In total, 38 rotifer species of 20 genera and 13 families were identified. Brachionus, Lecane, and Trichocerca dominated the locality. Rotifer density was positively correlated with water temperature and conductivity. However, negative correlation was observed with pH, dissolved oxygen, and total hardness. ANOVA expressed statistically significant differences in all of the physicochemical parameters of water from January to December. Hierarchical cluster analysis of variables showed that temporal differences were present in the rotifer community, which may be seasonal in nature.																			1300-0179	1303-6114					2013	37	6					699	705		10.3906/zoo-1209-17	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/zoo-1209-17													WOS:000325268300005
J	Zhang, KT; Zhang, ZY				Zhang, Katherine T.; Zhang, Zhiyi			Shakespearean Sonnets versus Shakespearean Canon	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE LINGUISTICS												The objective of this article is twofold. First several recently established mathematical results regarding diversity indices are introduced. These results include a re-parameterization of the word type probability distribution, a generalization of Simpson's diversity index, a family of optimal estimators of the generalized Simpson's indices, and two large sample distributional properties of the estimators. Second several characteristics of word type diversity are measured for a collection of 14 Shakespearean sonnets and for the Shakespearean canon. A difference in word type diversity, and in turn, in word type relative frequency distribution, between Shakespearean sonnets and the Shakespearean canon is observed with significant statistical evidence. This finding suggests that in general, as measured by word type diversity, the same author could have distinct word usage patterns in different forms of writing, and that in particular, caution must be taken when the Shakespearean canon is used as a basis for authorship attribution to Shakespeare where sonnets are concerned.																			0929-6174						2010	17	2					81	93	PII 922242855	10.1080/09296171003642983	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09296171003642983													WOS:000277771100001

In the even-aged Scots pine stands, 293 sample plots were selected to represent various stand conditions such as site quality, age, and stand density. The stand structural diversity, including Shannon's, improved Shannon, Simpson's, McIntosh, Margalef, and Berger-Parker indices, was used to correlate the stand carbon storage values. Positive partial correlation coefficients between stand carbon storage and forest structural diversity indices, including the improved Shannon index (r=0.770), Shannon's index (r=0.742), Simpson's index (r=0.703), the Berger-Parker index (r=0.657), the Gini index (r=0.390), and the Margalef index (r=0.327), were found at the 0.01 level. These results offer an enhancement of theories concerning positive relationships between stand carbon storage and stand structural diversity for pure and single-species forests. Moreover, regarding biodiversity suitability and stand carbon storage as carbon sinks, the results illustrate that forest stands with higher structural diversity may be preferred when used to mitigate global warming.

To investigate the influence of soil physicochemical properties on the diversity of understory plants in urban forests, this study used 30 urban forest communities in the Beijing Plain area as the research object and analyzed the correlation between understory plant diversity and soil factors by correlation analysis. Furthermore, pH, soil bulk density (SBD), total soil porosity (TSP), soil water content (SWC), soil organic carbon (SOC), soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), effective phosphorous (AP), and effective potassium (AK) were determined in this study. The Shannon diversity index (H'), Pielou evenness index (E), Simpson dominance index (C), and Margalef richness index (DMG) of understory plants were calculated. The soil nutrient contents and the understory plant diversity indices of the different community types showed significant differences. There was a strong correlation between soil properties and the diversity index of understory vegetation. SOM and SOC were the main factors affecting the Shannon-Wiener index, Pielou index, Simpson index, and Margalef richness index of the understory plants. We conclude that soil properties were one of the primary drivers of the formation of understory vegetation diversity. The results of the study can provide scientific guidance for the management of urban forests.																				1999-4907				MAR	2023	14	3							571	10.3390/f14030571	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f14030571													WOS:000955381900001

However, the relationship between plant community diversity and ecological stoichiometry has not yet been fully researched in arid and semi-arid regions. Ecological stoichiometry and plant community diversity indices of eighteen communities in the upper reaches of Tarim River, northwestern China, were analyzed by multivariate analysis of variance in 2016. The correlation between ecological stoichiometry and plant community diversity was assessed by redundancy analysis (RDA). Results indicated that the Margalef's index was significantly correlated with carbon (C) and P concentrations, the Simpson's index and Shannon-Weaner index were significantly correlated with plant C concentration, and the Pielou's index was significantly correlated with plant C and N concentrations. Moreover, C:N and C:P ratios had significant impacts on plant community diversity.

J	Lande, R				Lande, R			Statistics and partitioning of species diversity, and similarity among multiple communities	OIKOS												Species richness, Shannon information, and Simpson diversity are the three most commonly used nonparametric measures of species diversity. The sampling bias and variance of these measures differ greatly. Species richness may be seriously underestimated for even very large samples from a speciose community. The bias in species richness and Shannon information depend on unknown parameters of the species abundance distribution. An unbiased estimator exists only for Simpson diversity. Each of these measures is concave, so that the total diversity in a pooled set of communities exceeds (or equals) the average diversity within communities. The total diversity in a set of communities can therefore be partitioned into positive, additive components within and among communities, corresponding to alpha- and beta-diversity. Partitioning Simpson diversity corresponds to an analysis of variance. The proportion of the total diversity found within communities provides a natural measure of similarity among multiple communities. The expected similarity among multiple random samples from the same community depends on the number of samples and on the underlying measure of diversity.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				MAY	1996	76	1					5	13		10.2307/3545743	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545743													WOS:A1996UY43300002

Community assessment techniques and the implications for rarefaction and extrapolation with Hill numbers	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Diversity estimates play a key role in ecological assessments. Species richness and abundance are commonly used to generate complex diversity indices that are dependent on the quality of these estimates. As such, there is a long-standing interest in the development of monitoring techniques, their ability to adequately assess species diversity, and the implications for generated indices. To determine the ability of substratum community assessment methods to capture species diversity, we evaluated four methods: photo quadrat, point intercept, random subsampling, and full quadrat assessments. Species density, abundance, richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity were then calculated for each method. We then conducted a method validation at a subset of locations to serve as an indication for how well each method captured the totality of the diversity present. Density, richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity estimates varied between methods, despite assessments occurring at the same locations, with photo quadrats detecting the lowest estimates and full quadrat assessments the highest. Abundance estimates were consistent among methods. Sample-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves indicated that differences between Hill numbers (richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity) were significant in the majority of cases, and coverage-based rarefaction and extrapolation curves confirmed that these dissimilarities were due to differences between the methods, not the sample completeness. Method validation highlighted the inability of the tested methods to capture the totality of the diversity present, while further supporting the notion of extrapolating abundances. Our results highlight the need for consistency across research methods, the advantages of utilizing multiple diversity indices, and potential concerns and considerations when comparing data from multiple sources.

Diversity of organisms, measurement of variety and examination of those hypotheses that are about reasons of diversity are such as affairs that have been desired by the ecologists for a long time. In this research, diversity of plant species in forest region, numbers of 60 sample plots in 256.00 square meters have been considered in random systematic inventory was considered. In each sample plot, four micro-plots in 2.25 square meters in order to study on herbal cover, were executed that totally 240 micro-plots were considered. At each plot six diversity indices in relation to physiographic factors (slope, geographical aspect and altitude from the sea level) were studied. The results indicate that species diversity is more in the northern direction and also species diversity in slops less than 30% has the most amounts. Factor of altitude from the sea level did not have meaningful relation with species diversity. Through study on correlation of the numbers of species in sample plots with indices and also process and role of indices in different processors of analysis, Simpson's reciprocal index was suggested as suitable index in this type of studies.																					978-960-474-136-6				2009							92	+																WOS:000276579600014

In this study, we measured the hyperspectral reflectances and plant species diversity indices at a fine scale (0.8 meter) in central Hunshandak Sandland of Inner Mongolia, China. The first-order derivative value (FD) at each waveband and 37 hyperspectral indices were used to assess plant species diversity. Results demonstrated that the stepwise linear regression of FD can accurately estimate the Simpson (R-2 = 0.83), Pielou (R-2 = 0.87) and Shannon-Wiener index (R-2 = 0.88). Stepwise linear regression of FD (R-2 = 0.81, R-2 = 0.82) and spectral vegetation indices (R-2 = 0.51, R-2 = 0.58) significantly predicted the Margalef and Gleason index. It was proposed that the Simpson, Pielou and Shannon-Wiener indices, which are widely used as plant species diversity indicators, can be precisely estimated through hyperspectral indices at a fine scale. This research promotes the development of methods for assessment of plant diversity using hyperspectral data.																			2045-2322					MAR 19	2018	8								4776	10.1038/s41598-018-23136-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-23136-5								29555982					WOS:000427685200001

Analyzing the (mis)behavior of Shannon index in eutrophication studies using field and simulated phytoplankton assemblages	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The Shannon index of diversity H' is a commonly used metric in ecology. The tendency of this index to show a unimodal relationship with productivity has been the subject of several studies. In the present work, the behavior of H' and three related ecological indices (Simpson, Hill, and Evenness) was investigated using phytoplankton assemblages along a eutrophication gradient. We used both natural and simulated assemblages, whereby the comparison enabled us to assess the role of environmental 'noise' on index behavior. We developed simulated assemblages based on phytoplankton distributions predicted by two model types: the log series statistical model and the random fraction niche-based model. Using field data, H' and the related Simpson index showed expected unimodal relationships with eutrophication. The same unimodal relationships were reproduced with simulated assemblages. Comparing the simulations with natural assemblages along a eutrophication gradient showed that there was much unexplained variance in the real-world data, suggesting that these diversity indices are sensitive to stochastic processes. An analysis of the simulated assemblages using relative abundance distributions suggested that increasing H' and Simpson index values in the low range of the eutrophication gradient were due to increasing species richness, and that decreasing index values in the high range of the eutrophication gradient were due to decreasing evenness. In addition, this analysis revealed how assemblages of identical H' values arose from contrasting community structures found in the low- and high-range of eutrophication. The high variability and non-linearity of the Shannon and Simpson indices along a eutrophication gradient suggests that these measures of diversity are inappropriate for use as water quality monitoring assessment tools. Indeed, when calculating ecological quality ratios that are employed by the European Water Framework Directive, unreliable (non-monotonic) predictions of water quality resulted.

The beta component and the ratio of within-group to total diversity (alpha/gamma) are then used to infer the compositional differentiation or similarity of the sites. There is debate about the appropriate measures and partitioning formulas for this purpose. We test the main partitioning methods, using empirical and simulated data, to see if some of these methods lead to false conclusions, and we show how to resolve the problems that we uncover. Location South America, Ecuador, Orellana province, Rio Shiripuno. Methods We construct sets of real and simulated tropical butterfly communities that can be unambiguously ranked according to their degree of differentiation. We then test whether beta and similarity measures from the different partitioning approaches rank these datasets correctly. Results The ratio of within-group diversity to total diversity does not reflect compositional similarity, when the Gini-Simpson index or Shannon entropy are used to measure diversity. Additive beta diversity based on the Gini-Simpson index does not reflect the degree of differentiation between N sites or communities. Main conclusions The ratio of within-group to total diversity (alpha/gamma) should not be used to measure the compositional similarity of groups, if diversity is equated with Shannon entropy or the Gini-Simpson index. Conversion of these measures to effective number of species solves these problems. Additive Gini-Simpson beta diversity does not directly reflect the differentiation of N samples or communities. However, when properly transformed onto the unit interval so as to remove the dependence on alpha and N, additive and multiplicative beta measures yield identical normalized measures of relative similarity and differentiation.

However, a generalized framework that puts diversity and dissimilarity coefficients under the same formal umbrella is still lacking. In this paper, we show that generalized means represent an effective tool to develop a unifying formulation for the construction of a large array of parametric diversity and dissimilarity measures. These measures include some of the classical diversity coefficients, such as the Shannon entropy, the Gini-Simpson index or the parametric diversity of Patil and Taillie, together with a large number of dissimilarity coefficients of the Bray-Curtis family and can be further extended to the measurement of functional and phylogenetic differences within and between plots.

J	Nasiri, A; Shafiei, N; Zandi, R				Nasiri, Abouzar; Shafiei, Najmeh; Zandi, Rahman			Evaluation of Geodiversity Across Noorabad Basin (Fars Province, Iran)	GEOHERITAGE												Geodiversity is a landscape property linked to the heterogeneity of physical features across the Earth's surface. It refers to the wide span of diversity in geological features and phenomena, resembling the concept of biodiversity in natural living organisms (including plants and animals). Hosting highly complex geological phenomena and features, Iran exhibits high degrees of geodiversity. The present study aims to evaluate the geodiversity in pretty virgin natural areas for developing geotourism spaces, attracting tourists, and expanding ecosystems in the Noorabad basin. The case study is part of sub-basins (SWs) in Hendijan and Jarahi, located northwest of the Fars Province, southwestern Iran. The methodology of this research is based on analytic techniques and field surveys. For this purpose, we began by preparing topographic position indicator (TPI), climatology, geology, and morphology layers, then calculating diversity and richness indexes. Finally, the layers were compiled to come up with a final map of five geodiversity indexes, including patch richness density (PRD), Simpson's roughness index (SIEI), Shannon's roughness index (SHEI), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and Simpson's diversity index (SIDI). The results showed that the geodiversity was higher in the SW1 due to the higher diversity of this zone in terms of lithology, geomorphology, and climatology. In the SW1, the values of PRD, SIEI, SHEI, SHDI, and SIDI were estimated at 0.31, 0.81, 0.68, 1.56, and 0.87, respectively. This geodiversity in the southern part of the Noorabad basin has leveraged tourism development in this area.

On the other hand, uncensused populations whose diversity with respect to a certain aspect is required to be quantified, often arise naturally stratified and large samples from them are available. Targets of this paper are: to approximate the optimum allocation in estimating the Gini-Simpson diversity in stratified sampling so that the asymptotic precision is maximized; to introduce the relative gain in precision from stratified sampling (with optimum allocation) over random one as a measure of the adequacy of a variate for stratification in approximating diversity; to construct a procedure to test the convenience of a given variate for stratification in estimating diversity from large samples.					; RG, SMABSS/N-3322-2018; Gil, Maria Angeles/B-6568-2014	Research Group, SMIRE+CoDiRE/0000-0002-8871-4942; RG, SMABSS/0000-0001-9944-3861; Gil, Maria Angeles/0000-0003-0096-104X													0302-9743		3-540-60116-3				1995	945						210	216																WOS:A1995BF02B00020

In this paper the first four moments of this generalized index are derived for both a general species abundance distribution and the case with all species abundances equal, the equiprobable case. This allows the skewness and kurtosis of the index to be determined and thus gives information about the distribution of the index.

First, the behavior of the species richness, Shannon's, and Simpson's diversity indices were determined on polar lipid fatty acid profiles of 115 pure cultures, communities constructed from those profiles with different numbers of species, and constructed communities with different distributions of species. Differences in the species richness of these artificial communities was detected by all three diversity indices, but they were insensitive to the evenness of the distribution of species. Second, data from a field experiment with substrate addition to soil was used to compare the methods developed for lipid- and DNA-based diversity indices. Very good agreement was found between indices calculated from environmental polar lipid fatty acid profiles and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles from matched samples (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.95-0.96). A method for data pre-treatment for diversity calculations is described. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study was conducted to demonstrate that diversity of biofilms might be quantified by either of two indices, Shannon-Weaver and Simpson, based on the DGGE (denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) profiles of DNA extracted from the communities. Using such a method, the diversity indices of anaerobic marine biofilms were estimated, and compared with those of the corresponding microbial communities in suspension. The DGGE profiles of DNA revealed the presence of 22 species in both communities. The Shannon-Weaver and Simpson indices of the biofilms averaged 2.69 and 0.19, respectively. The former was about 9% lower and the latter was about 16% higher than the corresponding indices of the suspended communities. Results in both cases show that the suspended communities were more diverse than the biofilms. Details of the biofilm and suspended communities, derivations of both indices and implications of these results will be discussed.					fang, han/GSN-6404-2022																90-5809-653-X				2004							563	565																WOS:000221374300123

Marine ichthyofaunal biodiversity in the trawling grounds off Mangalore coast	INDIAN JOURNAL OF GEO-MARINE SCIENCES												Present investigation was taken to assess the status of ichthyofaunal diversity off Mangalore coast. The data for the present study was collected from the multiday trawlers operating from Mangalore fishing harbour over a period from September-2012 to April-2013 and sampling was done once in fortnight. A total 97 species belonging to 72 genera, 50 families and 15 orders were recorded during the study period. The value of Shannon-Wienner index (H') was recorded ranged from 1.404 to 1.648. There is less variability among H'. Diversity and evenness are highly correlated (0.90) and showed variation with each other. Average value of Simpson index was found to be 0.038 and the value of Simpson index increased with decrease in diversity. In the present study the Margalef richness index showed a high positive correlation with H', N-1 and N-2, and J' and negative with Simpson index (lambda), Evenness index (N-21 and N-21'). The value of H' showed positive correlation with all diversity indices except lambda. K-dominance plot clearly demonstrated the diversity pattern during the study period. When the data of 8 month (September-2012 to April-2013) were plotted together, the curve which lied on the lower side during October -2012 extended further and rose slowly due to the presence of more number of species. K-dominance curve showed that density of fish species was high in the month of October -2012 and proved the number of species (richness) more in the month of October -2012 compared to other months. Bray-Curtis similarity (hierarchical clustering) from the overall cluster analysis, it was observed that the maximum similarity (89.65%) was observed between March-2013 and April-2013.

Our object of study will be the Simpson index which measures the level of diversity of the population, one of the key parameters for ecologists who study for example, forest dynamics. Following ecological motivations, we will consider, here, the case, where there are various species with fitness and immigration parameters being random processes (and thus time evolving). The Simpson index is difficult to evaluate when the population is large, except in the neutral (no selection) case, because it has no closed formula. Our approach relies on the large population limit in the "weak" selection case, and thus to give a procedure which enables us to approximate, with controlled rate, the expectation of the Simpson index at fixed time. We will also study the long time behavior (invariant measure and convergence speed towards equilibrium) of the Wright-Fisher process in a simplified setting, allowing us to get a full picture for the approximation of the expectation of the Simpson index.																			1793-5245	1793-7159				AUG	2020	13	6							2050046	10.1142/S1793524520500461	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S1793524520500461													WOS:000570006000004

We define co-dominants as a subset of species that are more abundant and more uniformly distributed than other species in a given sample. We compare the sample with a model community and use Simpson's diversity index to estimate the apparent number of co-dominants. Dominant species determined in this way are responsible for 70-90% of the total measure of abundance in the sample. The statistical significance of the apparent number of co-dominants may be assessed by a randomization test.					, Zaal/ABC-7252-2021	, Zaal/0000-0002-5007-4484													0912-3814	1440-1703				JUL	2002	17	4					519	525		10.1046/j.1440-1703.2002.00508.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1440-1703.2002.00508.x													WOS:000176300000009

The identified foraminiferal fauna of the Gulf consists of 15% Textulariina (agglutinated forms), 37% Miliolina (porcellaneous forms), 0.1% Lagenina, 1% Globigerinina (planktic forms) and 47% Rotaliina (the last mentioned three suborders constituting the hyaline forms). Cluster analysis of quantitative data on the distribution of tests of foraminiferal species in the samples allow us to determine four assemblages, generally corresponding to the major geomorphic provinces of the Gulf: a western Iranian Shallow Shelf assemblage, an assemblage distributed all over the Axial Zone of the Arabian Gulf, a deep water assemblage of the Central Basin of the Gulf extending up to the Strait of Hormuz and an Arabian Shallow Shelf assemblage. The study of the geographical distribution of these assemblages and their relation to major geographical characteristics of the surrounding lands suggests that the nature of the foraminiferal assemblages depends mainly on biotic factors. The fauna of the Iranian Shelf displays a high diversity (average Yule-Simpson diversity index for the assemblage 39.2) as it receives an appreciable amount of nutrients from drainages in the topographically high Iranian hinterland. The fauna of the Arabian Shelf displays relatively low diversities (average Yule-Simpson diversity index for the assemblage 16.1) as the arid Arabian hinterland is practically deprived of active drainage. The foraminiferal fauna of the deepest parts of the investigated localities display low diversities and include appreciable proportions of agglutinated forms. Lowest diversities are observed near the Strait of Hormuz (Yule-Simpson diversity index of 14.9), highest diversities near the mouth of Shatt Al-Arab (Yule-Simpson diversity index of 62.9). This suggests that the amounts of nutrients provided by drainages debouching in a landlocked basin is an important factor determining the constitution of the foraminifera of bottom sediments.																			0026-2803	1937-2795				FAL	1997	43	3					253	280		10.2307/1485827	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1485827													WOS:000071334500002

Investigating Unused Tools for the Animal Behavioral Diversity Toolkit	ANIMALS												Simple Summary Behavioral diversity is sometimes used by animal scientists to better understand and compare how animals behave. The methods used in behavioral diversity research have not been investigated across the entire research sector. This paper aims to identify which methods are being used in behavioral diversity research and find some novel methods from other areas of science that could be used in new research. To investigate the techniques and species investigated in behavioral diversity literature, a literature search was conducted. Two methods: behavioral richness and the Shannon-Wiener index, were the most often used methods, whereas the Behavioral Variability index featured rarely. While a range of species appeared in the behavioral literature, mammals were the most frequently studied animal group, whereas amphibians did not feature in any papers. There are several diversity indices which did not feature in behavioral diversity including Simpson's index, and Chao. These methods could be used to better understand animal behavioral study outputs or be used to estimate the number of 'unobserved' behaviors that an animal may express. Future studies could therefore make use of these unused tools. Behavioral diversity is a commonly used tool used to quantify the richness and evenness of animal behaviors and assess the effect of variables that may impact an animal's quality of life. The indices used in behavioral diversity research, and the study subjects, have not been formally reviewed. This paper aims to identify which indices are being used in behavioral diversity research, and under which scenarios, and uncover novel indices from other disciplines that could be applied to behavioral diversity. To investigate the techniques and species investigated in behavioral diversity literature, a Web of Science literature search was conducted. Two methods: behavioral richness and the Shannon-Wiener index, were the most frequently used indices, whereas the Behavioral Variability index featured rarely. While a range of species appeared in the behavioral literature, mammals were the most frequently studied Class, whereas amphibians did not feature in any papers. There are several diversity indices which did not feature in behavioral diversity including Simpson's index, and Chao. Such indices could be used to better understand animal behavioral study outputs or be used to estimate the number of 'unobserved' behaviors that an animal may express. Future studies could therefore extend beyond the Shannon-Wiener and richness indices.

Teixeira			Modeling and mapping diversity of pathogenic fungi of wheat fields using geographic information systems (GIS)	CROP PROTECTION												In this study, geographic information systems and remote sensing tools were integrated and used to investigate the diversity of pathogenic fungi of wheat fields in Qarasoo basin, Golestan province, Iran. Two distinct indices, Shannon-Wiener and Simpson, were employed in order to express species diversity. The relationships between these indices and a number of independent variables such as topographic, soil and climatic variables were investigated to understand the relationships between fungal pathogen diversity and the agroecosystem while 67 georeferenced wheat field data using 0.25 m(2) quadrats were used to calculate the indices. Mallow's Cp statistical method was employed to select the most suitable factors while multiple regressions served to select model development, with two diversity maps being produced using the developed models. Residual maps were used to test the validity of the models. Rainfall and soil factors (zinc and nitrogen) formed the most important components that are effective determinants of pathogenic fungal diversity. High Simpson (0.60-0.69) and high Shannon -Wiener (1.40-1.67) values were detected in areas with higher rainfall at higher altitudes which were considered to be the most endangered areas. Considering the different responses of the models, Shannon -Wiener was found to be suitable for rare species while the Simpson model might be appropriate for a single dominant pathogenic fungus in the study area.

To study the diversity of trees and shrub species in the Perc forest situated in Khorramabad, Lorestan, 140 circular plots of 1200 m(2) in a grid of 300 m x 250 m were surveyed, using a systematic random sampling method. In each plot, the Margalef richness index, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Hill's N-1 and Simpson indices and the evenness index of Simpson and Smith-Wilson were calculated and ordered on the basis of different classes of elevation, exposition and slope. The results indicated that slope did not have any significant effect on the indices. Exposition and elevation classes significant impacted the richness and diversity indices, but did not influence evenness. In general, the highest plant diversity was observed for slopes less than 15 %, northern aspects, without geographical direction, and elevations of 2100-2200 m. This information can be very useful in achieving the goals for sustainable management of forests. In addition to greater protection for regions with high diversity and reforestation (compatible species) in degraded area, we can help increase diversity in forests.

Macrofaunal feeding functional groups and functional diversity were studied in the adjacent waters of the Yangtze River Estuary. The detritivorous group had the highest species number, abundance and secondary productivity while the canivorous group had the highest biomass. Pearson correlation analysis showed that functional evenness was negatively correlated with species number and Shannon-Wiener index. Functional divergence was negatively correlated with Simpson dominance index. Functional dispersion was positively correlated with species evenness, Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson dominance index. High values of functional diversity mainly cooccurred with high species diversity, uniform trait distribution and small niche overlap, indicating weak interspecific competition and high resources utilization. The dominant species were miniaturized and their biological traits analysis indicated that the study area has been disturbed for long time, resulting in the decline of the benthic ecosystem stability.

J	GHENT, AW				GHENT, AW			INSIGHTS INTO DIVERSITY AND NICHE BREADTH ANALYSES FROM EXACT SMALL-SAMPLE TESTS OF THE EQUAL ABUNDANCE HYPOTHESIS	AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST												Exact test procedures are detailed for niche breadth as the general case, and for diversity as a subset of niche breadth analysis. Numerators of niche breadth probabilities are obtained as chain multiplications of three individually simple combinatorial calculations, only two of which are needed in analyses of species diversity. Algebraic checks on counts of terms and sums of numerators are developed. The two-niche case is used to demonstrate the high probabilities associated with high niche diversity, these effectively limiting tests for significant nonrandomness to the low diversity tail. Examination of diversity indices as rank-ordering devices reveals that all the common indices (Shannon's H', Brillouin's H, Simpson's C' and its close relatives) yield rank orders identical to some algebraic functions of the equiprobable 1:1:..:1 model, so that any use of these indices locks us into the equiprobable model no matter what alternative model we may claim as our intended interest. These common indices are found to yield very similar rank orderings, so that the likelihood of disagreement with a "correct" ordering is less than 5% for neighboring partitions of N organisms into n niches or s species, and much less than 5% for randomly selected partitions, even if a diversity index is selected at random without regard for its theoretical suitabilities. The statistical expectation of Simpson's C' (the complement of Simpson's original index) is found to be (n - 1)/n for n niches regardless of N, and to be (s - 1)/s for s species, to four decimal places or more, if species diversity sampling is continued until each species is represented on average by 7.5 individuals or more. The "evenness" measures V' and V, representing ratios of observed to maximum values of diversity indices, are found to attain values of 0.99 or more at the 50th percentiles of the probability distributions of diversity indices and are judged to be ecologically misleading and valueless. The claim that there is anything about Brillouin's H that suits it more to a census than a sample is disputed. Simpson's C' is recommended as the most serviceable of the examined indices, both because of the simple formulae for its statistical expectations and because its rank orderings are found to be identical to those given by the variance (or its square root) of the counts of species or niche occupants.																			0003-0031					OCT	1991	126	2					213	255		10.2307/2426100	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2426100													WOS:A1991GM89100001
J	RATLIFF, RD				RATLIFF, RD			RANGELAND-ALPHA DIVERSITIES - HARVEY VALLEY, LASSEN-NATIONAL-FOREST, CALIFORNIA	GREAT BASIN NATURALIST												Monitoring diversity usually begins by estimating alpha diversity of a plant community on a specific site. The objectives of this study were to provide alpha diversity benchmarks and to determine whether rangeland community basal cover characteristics explained variation in diversity estimates. Plant and surface component cover percentages were estimated on 51 plots (representing four vegetation types) on the Lassen National Forest, CA. Each plot was sampled with 30 random, 102 basal point transects. Jackknife procedures were used to compute means and standard errors for Margalef's diversity index (D-m), which stresses species richness, and. Simpson's index (D-s), which stresses species dominance. Within vegetation types, D-m and D-s did not rank all plots in the same order Highest D-m values occurred with the most species. Highest D-s values occurred with comparatively few species but more uniform cover. With either index, average diversity declined from the meadow to grassland to open shrub-grass to timber-bunchgrass types. All possible subset regressions of diversity on the basal cover characteristics were computed. Portions of the variance accounted for by the best models were too low to allow prediction of D-m and D-s. The relation of alpha diversity to rangeland health is discussed.																			0017-3614					JAN	1995	55	1					46	57																WOS:A1995QE75300005
J	Bennie, J; Anderson, K; Wetherelt, A				Bennie, Jonathan; Anderson, Karen; Wetherelt, Andrew			Measuring biodiversity across spatial scales in a raised bog using a novel paired-sample diversity index	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1. Biodiversity is an inherently spatial phenomenon. It is determined by environmental heterogeneity and by spatially structured ecological processes such as disturbance, competition and dispersal. However, conventional biodiversity indices are based on discrete samples or pooled sets of samples without sufficient consideration of the spatial relationships between the samples. 2. Here we describe a new method for spatial analysis of species diversity, based on a paired-sample version of the widely used Gini-Simpson diversity index and its numbers equivalent. The index and its numbers equivalent are plotted as a function of lag distance between two samples along spatial and/or environmental gradients. 3. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by applying it to two transects of fine-scale (5 x 5 cm quadrat) vegetation data from sites with contrasting hydrology within a raised bog, where the location of each quadrat is accurately recorded and the height of the bog surface above the water table is measured using a terrestrial laser scanner. 4. Both transects have similar alpha-diversity as measured using the Gini-Simpson index, and the transition between alpha- and gamma-diversity occurs at similar length scales, suggesting that species aggregate at similar scales along both transects. However, the transect from the central bog dome has higher gamma-diversity than that from the bog margin, and shows more marked significant spatial structure at a length scale of 135-140 cm, corresponding to the typical hummock hollow microtopography at the site. We show that beta-diversity at both transects can be attributable to both species clustering along the hydrological gradient, consistent with niche partitioning, as well as independent spatial aggregation of species that is not explained by hydrology. 5. Synthesis. The paired-sample diversity index described here is a potentially useful tool in detecting and attributing patterns of beta-diversity along both spatial and environmental gradients.

THE EFFECTS OF RETURNING FARMLANDS TO FORESTS OR PASTURES ON SOIL ANIMAL DIVERSITY AND ITS REGIONAL DIFFERENTIATION CHARACTERISTICS IN CHINA: A META-ANALYSIS	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of returning farmlands to forests or pastures on soil animal diversity and its regional differentiation characteristics in China Overall, based on the Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index values, we found that returning farmland to forest (pasture) had an important effect on soil animal diversity. Forests and pastures might have a higher species richness and lower species evenness of soil animals than farmland. The effect of returning farmland to forest on soil animal diversity was greater than the effect of a return to pasture, although the effects varied between different land use/cover changes. The Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index values showed different regional characteristics of soil animals when returning farmland to forest (pasture) in North China, South China, Northwest China and Qinghai-Tibet China Returning farmland to forest (pasture) should be more conducive to increasing soil animal species richness in high-temperature regions and increasing soil animal species evenness in low-temperature regions. Furthermore, in low-temperature regions, returning farmland to forest affected the soil animal diversity more than returning farmland to pasture. Returning farmland to forest was more conducive in improving soil animal diversity synthetically in dry regions, and the changes in soil animal diversity due to the effect of returning farmland to pasture were not evident between dry and rainy regions in China.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2020	18	5					6335	6353		10.15666/aeer/1805_63356353	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1805_63356353													WOS:000585225100020

MAINTAINING BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY OF MOTHS IN VINEYARDS	MENDELNET 2011					International Ph.D. Students Conference on MendelNet 2011	NOV 23, 2011	Fac Agron, Brno, CZECH REPUBLIC	Mendel Univ Brno, Fac Agron	Fac Agron			Research on biodiversity of moths was conducted in South Moravia in 2010. Four experimental sites were at two locations near the protected landscape area of Palava, three of them included methodically different managements in vineyards (conventional, integrated and organic) and the comparative closest forest-steppe habitat. Biodiversity of moths was studied using portable light traps with an 8 W ultraviolet lamp. A spectrum of moths called Macrolepidoptera was studied. The results demonstrate that biodiversity in vineyards is increasing with vineyards ecologization even at relatively large distance from natural habitats (up to several kilometers). The broad diversity and equitability indicators (Simpson's and Shannon-Wiener diversity index) show that organic vineyards have more distributed equitability and species balance is lower. It is therefore clear that the conventional vineyards are the most similar to each other by poor species spectrum and a low number of specimens. The most interesting findings resulted from Spearman's correlation coefficient. The most demonstrable (probability of 99%) is the influence of vegetation succession in alleyways on the number of specimens in the vineyards. Highly demonstrable (95%) are also influences of vegetation succession (on the number of species, number of specimens, Simpson's equitability index and Shannon's diversity index), duration of pheromones application in order to confuse male pests (the Simpson's diversity index and Shannon's equitability index), vineyard age on abundance of specimens and the use of insecticides on the number of species and specimens.																					978-80-7375-563-8				2011							802	807																WOS:000341783400100
J	Shimatani, K				Shimatani, K			On the measurement of species diversity incorporating species differences	OIKOS												When pairwise differences (relatedness) between species are numerically given, the average of the species differences weighted by relative frequencies can be used as a species diversity index. This paper first theoretically develops the indices of this type. then applies them to forestry data. As examples of diversity indices, this paper explores the taxonomic diversity and the newly introduced amino acid diversity, which is a modification of the nucleotide diversity in genetics. The first, mathematical part shows that both indices can be decomposed into three inner factors: evenness of relative frequencies (= the Simpson index), the simple average over species differences regardless of relative frequencies, and the taxonomic or genetic balance in relative frequencies. The taxonomic diversity has another decomposition: the sum over the Simpson indices at all the taxonomic levels. The second part examines the effects of different forest management techniques on diversity. It is shown that a thinning operation for promoting survival of specific desirable species also contributed to increasing the taxonomic diversity. If we calculated only conventional indices that do not incorporate species relatedness, we would simply conclude that the thinning did not significantly affect the diversity. The theoretical developments of the first part complement the result. leading us to a better interpretation about contrasting vegetation structures. The mathematical results also reveal that the amino acid diversity involves redundant species, which is undesirable when measuring diversity; hence, this index is used to demonstrates crucial points when we introduce species relatedness. The results suggest further possibilities of applying diversity indices incorporating species differences to a variety of ecological studies.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				APR	2001	93	1					135	147		10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.930115.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1034/j.1600-0706.2001.930115.x													WOS:000168901700015
J	Ndlovu, T; Khan, S; Khan, W				Ndlovu, Thando; Khan, Sehaam; Khan, Wesaal			Distribution and diversity of biosurfactant-producing bacteria in a wastewater treatment plant	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												The distribution and diversity of culturable biosurfactant-producing bacteria were investigated in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) using the Shannon and Simpson's indices. Twenty wastewater samples were analysed, and from 667 isolates obtained, 32 were classified as biosurfactant producers as they reduced the surface tension of the culture medium (71.1 mN/m), with the lowest value of 32.1 mN/m observed. Certain isolates also formed stable emulsions with diesel, kerosene and mineral oils. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) analysis classified the biosurfactant producers into the Aeromonadaceae, Bacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Gordoniaceae and the Pseudomonadaceae families. In addition, numerous isolates carried the surfactin 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (sfp), rhamnosyltransferase subunit B (rhlB) and bacillomycin C (bamC) genes involved in the biosynthesis of surfactin, rhamnolipid and bacillomycin, respectively. While, biosurfactant-producing bacteria were found at all sampling points in the WWTP, the Simpson's diversity (1 - D) and the Shannon-Weaver (H) indices revealed an increase in bacterial diversity in the influent samples (0.8356 and 2.08), followed by the effluent (0.8 and 1.6094) and then the biological trickling filter (0.7901 and 1.6770) samples. Numerous biosurfactant-producing bacteria belonging to diverse genera are thus present throughout a WWTP.

J	Fortin, M; Kondratyeva, A; Van Couwenberghe, R				Fortin, Mathieu; Kondratyeva, Anna; Van Couwenberghe, Rosalinde			Improved β-diversity estimators based on multiple-site dissimilarity: Distinguishing the sample from the population	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim beta-diversity is often measured through incidence-based dissimilarity indices, such as the Simpson and Sorensen indices. Multiple-site versions of these indices, which have been recently developed, enhance the accountability of global heterogeneity relative to the original formulations. However, they are known to be sensitive to the number of sites, which hinders the comparison of beta-diversity between two populations of unequal sizes. Moreover, the populations are never completely measured and the dissimilarity must be estimated from a sample of sites. Innovation In this study, we propose adapted multiple-site versions of the Simpson, Sorensen and nestedness indices that are population size-independent as well as estimators of these indices. The properties of the indices and their estimators were tested through simulation studies. These simulation studies show that the adapted indices were population size-independent. The estimators and their estimated standard errors were nearly unbiased for moderate sample sizes (n >= 25). Main conclusions These estimators of these adapted multiple-site dissimilarity indices now make it possible to compare the beta-diversity of two populations of unequal sizes.

In this study, 36 antiretroviral-naive HISs were enrolled to prospectively assess alterations in the fecal microbiota and plasma markers of microbial translocation and inflammation with cART. At baseline, the species alpha-diversity of the fecal microbiota was significantly lower in HISs with a CD4(+) T cell count <300/mm(3) than in HISs with a CD4(+) T cell count >300/mm(3) (Shannon index: Median 2.557 vs. 2.981, P= 0.006; Simpson index: Median 0.168 vs. 0.096, P= 0.004). Additionally, the baseline a-diversity indices correlated with CD4(+) T cell counts (Shannon index: r= 0.474, P= 0.004; Simpson index: r = -0.467, P = 0.004) and the specific plasma biomarkers for microbial translocation and inflammation. After cART introduction, the species a-diversity of fecal microbiota in HISs with CD4(+) T cell counts <300/mm(3) was significantly restored (Shannon index: Median 2.557 vs. 2.791, P = 0.007; Simpson index: Median 0.168 vs. 0.112, P = 0.004), while the variances were insignificant among HISs with CD4(+) T cell counts >300/mm(3) (Shannon index: Median 2.981 vs. 2.934, P = 0.179; Simpson index: Median 0.096 vs. 0.119, P = 0.082). Meanwhile, with cART introduction, alterations in the gut microbial composition were more significant in the subgroup with CD4(+) T cell counts >300/mm(3), corresponding to increases in the specific plasma inflammatory markers. These findings implicated the interactive roles of immunodeficiency and cART for affecting gut microbiota in HIV-1-infected individuals, providing new insights into intestinal microbiome dysbiosis related to HIV-1 infection.

Fifteen months of freely available Sentinel optical and radar data were used to predict taxonomic and functional diversity at the pixel scale (10 m x 10 m) over a large geographical extent (40,000 km(2)). 415 field measurements were collected in 83 grasslands to train and validate several statistical learning methods. The objective was to link the satellite spectro-temporal data to the plant diversity indices. Among the several diversity indices tested, Simpson and Shannon indices were best predicted with a coefficient of determination around 0.4 using a Random Forest predictor and Sentinel-2 data. The use of Sentinel-1 data was not found to improve significantly the prediction accuracy. Using the Random Forest algorithm and the Sentinel-2 time series, the prediction of the Simpson index was performed. The resulting map highlights the intra-parcel variability and demonstrates the capacity of satellite image time series to monitor grasslands plant taxonomic diversity from an ecological viewpoint.

However, the effect of the introduced plant on soil bacterial communities and restoration outcomes remains unknown. In this study, the rhizosphere bacterial community structure and diversity were compared between Phragmites australis monospecific community and A. trabeculosa-P. australis mixed communities, aiming to assess whether A. trabeculosa influenced the rhizosphere bacterial communities of P. australis and to investigate whether different taxonomic groups within a soil community may respond similarly to the presence of an introduced exotic plant. Among the 14 phylogenetic phyla detected, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria were the dominant bacterial taxa in the rhizosphere. Phylogenetic analysis of the predominant Proteobacteria showed that the clones from the rhizosphere soils of A. trabeculosa and P. australis in A. trabeculosa-P. australis mixed communities were more diverse than those in the rhizosphere soil of P. australis in P. australis monospecific community. The rhizosphere community in the wetland potentially included active microbial community related to carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling in the Yangtze River estuary. The rhizosphere soil of P. australis in A. trabeculosa-P. australis mixed communities exhibited the highest Shannon diversity index (H') and Simpson diversity index (1/D) (H = 4.52, 1/D = 253). Correspondence analyses revealed that the bacterial community structures were altered after A. trabeculosa was introduced.

The attention is drawn on examining whenever there is a tendency to cluster in some parts of a city, with the risk of generating ethnic enclaves or ghettoes, therefore analysing also diversity other than the pure spatial distribution. Methods used in the past to measure segregation and other characteristics of immigrants have long been aspatial, therefore not considering relationships between people within a city. In this paper the attention is dedicated to methods to analyse the immigrant residential distribution spatially, with particular reference to density and diversity-based methods. The analysis is focused on the Municipality of Trieste (Italy) as a case study to test different methods for the analysis of immigration, and particularly to compare different indices, particularly traditional ones, as Location Quotients and the Index of Segregation, to different, spatial ones, based on Kernel Density Estimation functions, as the S index, and indices of diversity, as Shannon (SHDI) and Simpson (SIDI) ones as well as another diversity index proposed (IDiv).

Assessing group differences in biodiversity by simultaneously testing a user-defined selection of diversity indices	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												Comparing diversities between groups is a task biologists are frequently faced with, for example in ecological field trials or when dealing with metagenomics data. However, researchers often waver about which measure of diversity to choose as there is a multitude of approaches available. As Jost (2008, Molecular Ecology, 17, 4015) has pointed out, widely used measures such as the Shannon or Simpson index have undesirable properties which make them hard to compare and interpret. Many of the problems associated with the use of these raw indices can be corrected by transforming them into true diversity measures. We introduce a technique that allows the comparison of two or more groups of observations and simultaneously tests a user-defined selection of a number of true diversity measures. This procedure yields multiplicity-adjusted P-values according to the method of Westfall and Young (1993, Resampling-Based Multiple Testing: Examples and Methods for p-Value Adjustment, 49, 941), which ensures that the rate of false positives (type I error) does not rise when the number of groups and/or diversity indices is extended.

Studying the relationship between stand structure and understory herbaceous plants species diversity is useful for managers to formulate the best forest structure optimization method with the goal of improving herbaceous species diversity. In this research, Platycladus orientalis plantations in Beijing were taken as the research object. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to explore the single-factor correlation between stand structure and understory herbaceous plants species diversity; furthermore, a typical correlation analysis and multiple linear regression were used to explore the multi-factor correlation and analyze the dominant stand structure parameters affecting understory herbaceous plants species diversity. In the range of stand structures studied, the results showed that canopy density was negatively correlated with the Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index (p < 0.01), and tree density was negatively correlated with the Shannon-Wiener index (p < 0.05). In terms of stand spatial structure, the mingling degree was positively correlated with the Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson index, Margalef richness index and Pielou evenness index (p < 0.05), while the uniform angle was negatively correlated with the Pielou evenness index (p < 0.05). The correlation coefficient of the first group of typical variables in the typical correlation analysis was 0.90 (p < 0.05); from this group of typical variables, it can be concluded that canopy density is the most influential indicator affecting the comprehensive index of understory herbaceous plants species diversity, with a load of -0.690, and the Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index are the most responsive indicators of changes in the comprehensive index of stand structure, with loads of 0.871 and 0.801, respectively. In the process of the management of Platycladus orientalis plantations under a low altitude, south slope, thin soil layer and hard soil parent material, in order to improve the herbaceous species diversity, the canopy density of the overstory and tree density should be appropriately reduced. Additionally, it is necessary to regulate the horizontal spatial structure of stands. When the trees are randomly distributed and the mingling degree is high, the species diversity of herbs can be increased.																				1999-4907				NOV	2022	13	11							1921	10.3390/f13111921	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13111921													WOS:000894906000001

The possibilities of its assessment and conservation are included in the latest European Union (EU) policies and reflected in the European Biodiversity Strategy. The biodiversity of weeds in winter cereals in organic and conventional low-input farms in Eastern Poland was investigated during a 3-year period. Significantly more species and larger abundance were found in organic than in conventional farming systems. The biodiversity of these communities was described by Shannon's diversity and Simpson's dominance indices, which showed diversity to be well maintained in both farming systems; however, significantly higher Shannon's index and significantly lower Simpson's index values were observed in organic farms. Both farming systems were the mainstay of endangered and rare species, as well as some invasive weed species. Weed communities of organic farms were dominated mostly bySetaria pumilaandElymus repens, while conventional farms were dominated byJuncus bufoniusandSetaria pumila. The study showed the importance of organic farming systems for biodiversity conservation. It was also shown that low-input (traditional) conventional farms are also beneficial for biodiversity conservation.

J	Qian, H				Qian, Hong			Beta diversity in relation to dispersal ability for vascular plants in North America	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												To test the hypothesis that plant species with a higher dispersal ability have a lower beta diversity. North America north of Mexico. Propagules of pteridophytes (ferns and their allies) are more vagile than propagules of spermatophytes (gymnosperms and angiosperms), and thus pteridophytes have a higher dispersal ability than do spermatophytes. The study area was divided into 71 geographical units distributed in five latitudinal zones. Species lists of pteridophytes and spermatophytes were compiled for each geographical unit. Three measures of beta diversity were used: beta(sim), which is one minus the Simpson index of similarity, beta(slope), which is the slope of the relationship between Simpson index and geographical distance, and beta(0.5-distance), which is the distance that halves the similarity from its initial value. Average beta(sim) is higher for spermatophytes than for pteridophytes, regardless of whether the data are analysed for the whole continent or for latitudinal zones. Average beta(sim) decreases with increasing latitude for both spermatophytes and pteridophytes. The difference in average beta(sim) between the two plant groups increases with increasing latitude, indicating that beta diversity decreases with increasing latitude faster for pteridophytes than for spermatophytes. When the Simpson index is regressed against geographical distance, the regression slope (beta(slope)) is steeper for spermatophytes than for pteridophytes, and the slope decreases with increasing latitude for both plant groups. Similarly, beta(0.5-distance) was shorter for spermatophytes than for pteridophytes in each latitudinal zone and increased with increasing latitude for both plant groups. The results of the analyses using the three different measures of beta diversity are consistent. The fact that beta diversity is lower for pteridophytes with vagile propagules than for spermatophytes with less vagile propagules suggests that beta diversity is negatively related to dispersal ability.																			1466-822X	1466-8238				MAY	2009	18	3					327	332		10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00450.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00450.x													WOS:000264957300006

Evaluation of multispecies marine fishery in West Bengal, India using diversity indices	INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES												The effective management and conservation of ecosystems rely greatly on the understanding of spatial and temporal distributions of the fish community, ecological variables and fishing activity. The information on landings for all species by commercial fisheries can facilitate analysis of species diversity and distribution patterns. This paper attempts to assess the marine fishery in West Bengal, with emphasis on the diversity with special regard to the variation in quantity of fish caught during different seasons. During this period, a total of 154 different species of fish and shellfishes were landed along the West Bengal coast among which, demersal species were highest in number (65), followed by pelagic species (59). Only two or three groups were dominant in different seasons. During the first (January March) and fourth (October December) season, the dominant groups were Bombayduck, croakers and prawns. While, in the third (July September) season, the dominant species were hilsa shad followed by Bombayduck and croakers. For assessing the diversity of fisheries in West Bengal, Simpson's index and Shannon's index were calculated from the season-wise estimated marine fish landings for the period 2007-2010. The values of Simpson's index varied from 0.06 to 0.37, the lowest recorded in first season of 2009 and highest in third season of 2007. The highest value was mainly because of the landings of a single species, the hilsa shad.																			0970-6011					APR-JUN	2013	60	2					43	47																WOS:000324080400006

In this paper, we study its asymptotic distribution for a large class of diversity indices on countable alphabets. In particular, we give conditions for the plug-in estimator to be asymptotically normal, and in the case of uniform distributions, where asymptotic normality fails, we give conditions for the asymptotic distribution to be chi-squared. Our results cover some of the most commonly used indices, including Simpson's index, Reyi's entropy and Shannon's entropy.																			1048-5252	1029-0311					2018	30	3					774	795		10.1080/10485252.2018.1482294	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10485252.2018.1482294													WOS:000441658300012

We identified tree species and examined the richness, alpha (alpha) diversity and floristic similarity patterns within the identified communities. Vegetation and environmental data were sampled in 120 (0.04 ha) study plots. Tree communities were delimited by two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). In total, 78 tree species of 35 families and 58 genera were identified. TWINSPAN identified six tree communities: A-Tricalysia singularis; B-Kydia calycina-Castanopsis tribuloides; C-Polyalthia simiarum-Duabanga grandiflora; D-Ficus roxburghii; E-Artocarpus lacucha; F-Artocarpus lacucha. Mean richness, Shannon and Gini-Simpson indices were highest for the Polyalthia simiarum-Duabanga grandiflora community, while Ficus roxburghii showed lowest diversity. Significant differences (p = 0.05) in three diversity indices were recorded between Polyalthia simiarum-Duabanga grandiflora and Ficus roxburghii. Tree compositional similarity was greatest between Kydia calycina-Castanopsis tribuloides and Polyalthia simiarum-Duabanga grandiflora (0.712).

J	Mouillot, D; Leprêtre, A				Mouillot, D; Leprêtre, A			A comparison of species diversity estimators	RESEARCHES ON POPULATION ECOLOGY												Although having been much criticized, diversity indices are still widely used in animal and plant ecology to evaluate, survey, and conserve ecosystems. It is possible to quantify biodiversity by using estimators for which statistical characteristics and performance are, as yet, poorly defined. In the present study, four of the most frequently used diversity indices were compared: the Shannon index, the Simpson index, the Camargo eveness index, and the Pielou regularity index. Comparisons were performed by simulating the Zipf-Mandelbrot parametric model and estimating three statistics of these indices, i.e., the relative bias, the coefficient of variation, and the relative root-mean-squared error. Analysis of variance was used to determine which of the factors contributed most to the observed variation in the four diversity estimators: abundance distribution model or sample size. The results have revealed that the Camargo eveness index tends to demonstrate a high bias and a large relative root-mean-squared error whereas the Simpson index is least biased and the Shannon index shows a smaller relative root-mean-squared error, regardless of the abundance distribution model used and even when sample size is small. Shannon and Pielou estimators are sensitive to changes in species abundance pattern and present a nonnegligible bias for small sample sizes (<1000 individuals).																			0034-5466						1999	41	2					203	215																WOS:000083085600011

This study was conducted during spring and summer to identify the species diversity using Shannon-Wiener, Brillouin and Simpson species diversity indices in addition to the importance value (IV). A total of 106 different species was recorded. Shannon-Wiener index was significantly higher in the protected area in comparison to the unprotected one (2.64 and 2.15; respectively) and during spring than summer seasons (2.50 and 2.28; respectively). The Simpson index did only reveal significant protection effect (P<0.001). Shannon-Wiener and Brillouin indices are suggested to be more appropriate to express diversity in the study sites. Acacia tortilis, Cenchrus ciliaris and Pennisetum divisum had the highest IV in both protected and unprotected areas during spring and summer. The IV values for A. tortilis ranged between 38.9%, in protected areas during spring, to 44.3% in unprotected areas during summer.

J	Kara, B				Kara, Baris			Assessment of the distribution and diversity of street tree species in Aydin, Turkey	JOURNAL OF FOOD AGRICULTURE & ENVIRONMENT												In the current study. the distribution and diversity of street-tree species were evaluated in Aydin City, Turkey, in correlation with land-use category and road-type. The study encompassed 100% of the city's limits covering 24 neighborhoods of Aydin. Wider limits of the city were used in the study. The study was performed in 92 avenues and 74 boulevards, comprising 7 land-use categories and 3032 street trees from 24 families, 39 genera, and 53 species. The Rutaceae and Citrus genera (particularly Cirrus aurantium L.) were the most common tree groups in the study area. The largest Shannon-Weiner Diversity index values were obtained in the avenues of residential areas (2.10) and boulevards of industrial areas (2.05). The largest Simpson's Diversity index values were in the avenues (0.81) and boulevards of industrial areas (0.85). It was suggested that the number of trees belonging to the Rutaceae family in avenues and boulevards across the city should be reduced to 470 in avenues and 440 in boulevards, while the number of trees belonging to the Citrus genera should be reduced to 313 in avenues and 293 in boulevards. The number of C. aurantium trees should be a maximum of 157 in avenues and 147 in boulevards. It was also suggested that the Shannon-Weiner Diversity index value should be increased to 2.94 in the avenues of residential areas and 3.80 in the boulevards of industrial areas, while the Simpson's Diversity index should be increased to 0.98 in the avenues and boulevards of industrial areas.

J	Roswell, M; Dushoff, J; Winfree, R				Roswell, Michael; Dushoff, Jonathan; Winfree, Rachael			A conceptual guide to measuring species diversity	OIKOS												Three metrics of species diversity - species richness, the Shannon index and the Simpson index - are still widely used in ecology, despite decades of valid critiques leveled against them. Developing a robust diversity metric has been challenging because, unlike many variables ecologists measure, the diversity of a community often cannot be estimated in an unbiased way based on a random sample from that community. Over the past decade, ecologists have begun to incorporate two important tools for estimating diversity: coverage and Hill diversity. Coverage is a method for equalizing samples that is, on theoretical grounds, preferable to other commonly used methods such as equal-effort sampling, or rarefying datasets to equal sample size. Hill diversity comprises a spectrum of diversity metrics and is based on three key insights. First, species richness and variants of the Shannon and Simpson indices are all special cases of one general equation. Second, richness, Shannon and Simpson can be expressed on the same scale and in units of species. Third, there is no way to eliminate the effect of relative abundance from estimates of any of these diversity metrics, including species richness. Rather, a researcher must choose the relative sensitivity of the metric towards rare and common species, a concept which we describe as 'leverage.' In this paper we explain coverage and Hill diversity, provide guidelines for how to use them together to measure species diversity, and demonstrate their use with examples from our own data. We show why researchers will obtain more robust results when they estimate the Hill diversity of equal-coverage samples, rather than using other methods such as equal-effort sampling or traditional sample rarefaction.

A 7-year experiment with four treatments, control (CK), warming (WA), straw application (SA), and warming and straw application (WASA), was performed in a winter wheat-soybean rotation crop field. We determined the bacterial, fungal, and archaeal community compositions and diversities and soil properties. The top dominant bacterial, fungal, and archaeal phyla in both 2020 and 2021 were Proteobacteria, Ascomycota, and Thaumarchaeota, respectively. SA partly offset the effects of WA on the bacterial alpha diversity, and WA and WASA significantly (P < 0.05) decreased the fungal Simpson index compared with CK in 2020. The principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) based on Bray-Curtis distances between treatments showed that the dissimilarities in bacteria, fungi, and archaea in 2021 were greater than those in 2020. The bacterial and archaeal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) richness, Chao1, Shannon index, and Simpson index, fungal Shannon and Simpson index and bacterial and fungal Bray-Curtis distances were generally significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with the soil temperature, available phosphorus (AP), microbial biomass carbon (MC), and the ratio of MC to microbial biomass nitrogen. Soil properties were important in regulating microbial community diversity under warming and straw application. AP was a key nutrient limiting factor of microbial alpha and beta diversities. We found contrasting driving patterns of MC associated with the bacterial and fungal alpha and beta diversities and the archaeal alpha diversity.

In this paper, a current literature review on the theme is presented and the mathematical properties of the index are outlined, focusing on the location of the maximizer (maximum point) and evaluation of the maximum value, with emphasis in the role of the Lagrange multiplier critical value-closely related with the harmonic mean of the weights-which is shown to be a barrier concerning the feasibility of the solution. Sequential procedures are presented, either backward or forward, which are used to obtain the correct values of the maximum point coordinates, thus allowing for the computation of the right maximum value of the index.

Obtaining data using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) provides a new direction for biodiversity monitoring. However, studies on the relationship between UAV data and biodiversity are limited. In this study, we used a machine learning algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of UAV-light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and UAV multispectral data for estimating three alpha-diversity indices in tropical forests located in Hainan, China. We obtained 126 biodiversity-related metrics (68 from multispectral and 58 from LiDAR) based on the UAV data and three alpha-diversity indices from 62 sample plots at two sites. We used the recursive feature elimination algorithm to filter significant metrics. We found that both multispectral and LiDAR data can be used to predict alpha-diversity. The coefficient of determination (R-2) values of multispectral data (LiDAR data) for the species richness, Shannon index, and Simpson index were 0.69, 0.70, and 0.57 (0.72, 0.63, 0.44), respectively. LiDAR data were more accurate than multispectral data for predicting species richness, whereas multispectral data were more accurate than LiDAR data for predicting the Shannon and Simpson indices. Given the best result obtained with a single datum, the accuracy (R-2) of the combination of the two data types for species richness and Shannon and Simpson indices increased by 0.05, 0.05, and 0.06, respectively, indicating that the prediction accuracy of the alpha-diversity index can be improved by integrating different remote sensing data. Additionally, the most important multispectral metrics used to predict alpha-diversity were related to vegetation index and texture metrics, whereas the most important LiDAR metrics were related to canopy height characteristics. Our research results indicate that UAV data are effective for predicting the alpha-diversity index of Hainan tropical forest on a fine scale. UAV data may help local biodiversity workers to identify vulnerable areas.

Pitfall Traps & Diversity Indices: Using Quantitative Reasoning to Test Edge Effect Theory	AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER												Students learning the skills of science benefit from opportunities to move between the scientific problems and questions they confront and the mathematical tools available to answer the questions and solve the problems. Indeed, students learn science best when they are actively engaged in pursuing answers to authentic and relevant questions. We present an activity teachers can use in the classroom to introduce the concepts of species richness and diversity. We break down the history and logic behind the two primary statistical tools ecologists use to quantify species diversity: Simpson's and Shannon's diversity indices. With hypothetical data, we show how students can learn about and practice the calculations. We then describe an activity where students collect authentic ecological data with pitfall traps while learning some arthropod systematics and practicing their newly acquired quantitative reasoning skills, all within the context of edge effect ecology and habitat conservation. The entire activity reinforces for students how interesting and helpful mathematical models and quantitative reasoning in science can be for understanding biological phenomena, but also for generating more questions, and for designing additional data-collection techniques and experiments.

J	JAROSIK, V				JAROSIK, V			ARE DIVERSITY INDEXES OF CARABID BEETLE (COL, CARABIDAE) COMMUNITIES USEFUL, REDUNDANT, OR MISLEADING	ACTA ENTOMOLOGICA BOHEMOSLOVACA												The value of diversity indices derivable from information theory studies of adult carabid beetles collected by pitfall traps was investigated. Shannon's and Simpson's formulae were applied for evaluation of annual changes and local habitat differences in catches of carabids in individual traps. I compared the significance of abundance and biomass as importance values, and the difference between long-term catches (i.e. throughout the whole period of surface activity of the species) and short-term ones. Indices based on abundance were more sensitive than that calculated from biomass. Shannon's and Simpson's indices appeared sensitive to differences in environments of different habitats when applied to long-term catches on natural sites. With short-term catches, seasonal variation in community structure and meteorological factors probably obscured the habitat differences in diversity of carabids. A reliable relative measure of carabid abundances obtained by means of long-term catches is perhaps necessary for satisfactory estimation of diversity indices. I argue that for assessment of long-term changes in natural communities, indices from information theory applied to data from long-term pitfall trapping may be superior to species abundance, richness, or biomass of carabids treated separately.																			0001-5601						1991	88	5					273	279																WOS:A1991GJ49500001

Comparison of plant species diversity with different plant communities in deciduous forests	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												Species diversity is one of the most important indices used for evaluating the sustainability of forest communities. This study aims to characterize the forest communities and to identify and compare the plant species diversity in the study area. For this purpose, 152 releves were sampled by a randomized-systematic method, using the Braun-Blanquet scale. Classification of the vegetation was conducted by the twinspan algorithm. Four communities, including Querco-Carpinetum betulii, Carpineto-Fagetum Oriental, Rusco-Fagetum Oriental and Fagetum Oriental were recognized. Species richness, Shannon, and Simpson indices were applied to quantify diversity of the different communities. Turkey test was used to investigate the differences in the species richness, diversity and evenness indices among the different communities. The results illustrate that Querco-Carpinetum betulii and Carpineto-Fagetum Oriental communities are significantly more diverse than Rusco-Fagetum Oriental and Fagetum Oriental communities. The spatial structure of the releves becomes more 'homogenous' and the dominance structure changes: the proportion of beech-forest species is gradually increasing. At the same time, the number of species per unit area decreases constantly, reaching eventually the value comparable to that recorded for hornbeam forest. Generally, species diversity is inversely correlated with the dominance of shade tolerant climax species.

These nonnative fishes interact with freshwater commercial fisheries in a variety of ways, influencing catch abundance, composition, and revenue. Using a 22-year data set collected from a commercial haul seine fishery, we aimed to explore the dynamics of yield and revenue in relation to nonnative fishes, with emphasis on the suckermouth armored catfishes (Pterygoplichthys spp.). Using profit index metrics and the inverse Simpson's diversity index, we found that non-native tilapia (Oreochromis spp.) and brown hoplo (Hoplosternum littorale) provided economic benefits while suckermouth armored catfishes seemed to disrupt catch consistency and lower profit index values. To reduce the negative impacts of the suckermouth armored catfishes and subsequently exert pressure on their population, we suggest marketing these edible fishes for human and/or animal consumption.

Culture dependent diversity and phylogeny of thermophilic bacilli from a natural hot spring reservoir in the Gir Forest, Gujarat (India)	MICROBIOLOGY												The thermophilic bacteria, isolated from a natural hot spring reservoir, Tulsi Shyam (Gir Forest, Gujarat, India) were characterized and diversified using the conventional approaches; Gram reaction, cell morphology, growth patterns, biochemical properties and antibiotic sensitivity. The bacteria were Gram positive, rod shaped and catalase positive. Majority of them produced amylase, indicating their ecological and biotechnological significance. The bacteria were further categorized on the basis of the amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) patterns, generated by a tetracutter RE, HaeIII. As a polyphasic taxonomy approach, the isolates were clustered into 9 different groups, based on the conventional approaches and the ARDRA patterns. The further analysis was based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The trend suggested that the phenotypic and phylogenetic diversity data considerably coincided. Overall, the part of Tulsi Shyam hot spring bacterial community represented by cultivated aerobic organotrophs can be clustered into 3 Genera, Anoxybacillus, Geobacillus/Aeribacillus and Bacillus. They can further be grouped into sub-clusters at the species level to establish phylogenetic and phenotypic relationship. Further, the diversity indices; Simpson's index, Dominance index and Shannon index indicated the species diversity, species richness and distribution evenness, respectively. A lower Simpson's index (0.1905) and higher Dominance index (0.8095) revealed significant bacterial diversity. While a higher Shannon index (2.987) suggested evenness in the bacterial distribution in different soil and water samples. The lower values of Berger-Parker Dominance index and Ginni coefficient supported the trends of the Shannon index. As the studied habitat was not earlier explored for the bacterial diversity, the findings would significantly add to the knowledge of the cultivation based microbial diversity.

Three types of simulations generated variations in communities that could be expected to be found in fieldwork, on rare, median and dominant taxa. Camargo index was the most sensitive to change in rare taxa and the least sensitive to change in dominant taxa. Berger-Parker and Simpson measures were strongly influenced by sample size. McIntosh and Simpson indices were strongly correlated but did not have the same sensitivity. We think that the McIntosh index is the best compromise between a strong sensitivity to dominant taxa and a lesser sensitivity to variations in the other taxa.

Nevertheless, the appropriateness of an index rather than another to transcribe trends in biodiversity of plankton communities is not clearly established. So, starting from the definitions of the diversity indices of Simpson, Gleason-Margalef, Menhinick, Brillouin, Shannon, Patten, Pielou and Hurlbert, the aim of this work is to state, under the assumption that the total number of individual is great, a mathematical convergence between the indices of Brillouin, Shannon, Simpson's reciprocal, Hurlbert on the one hand and between the indices of Pielou and Patten on the other hand. More particularly, it will be also established that these last two indices are complementary provided that the total number of individual is greater than the number of species. Gleason-Margalef's and Menhinick's indices will be considered as independents. Thus, such a convergence will lead to propose a classification of these indices into three great groups reducing their number from eight to four. This theoretical result will be then applied on phytoplankton and zooplankton communities of two neighbouring bays differently affected by anthropogenic inputs in NW Mediterranean Sea (Toulon area, France) throughout three consecutive annual cycles. A strong statistical correlation between the indices belonging to the same group seems to confirm the validity of our classification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Several key indices relate to mean trait dissimilarity between species within biological communities. Among them, the most widely used include (a) the mean species pairwise dissimilarity (MPD) and (b) the Rao quadratic entropy (and related indices). These indices are often regarded as redundant and promote the unsubstantiated yet widely held view that Rao is a form of MPD. Worryingly, existing R functions also do not always simplify the use and differentiation of these indices. In this paper, we show various distinctions between these two indices that warrant mathematical and biological consideration. We start by showing an existing form of MPD that considers species abundances and is different from Rao both mathematically and conceptually. We then show that the mathematical relationship between MPD and Rao can be presented simply as Rao = MPD x Simpson, where the Simpson diversity index is defined as 1 - dominance. We further show that this relationship is maintained for both species abundances and presence/absence. This evidence dismantles the paradigm that the Rao diversity is an abundance-weighted form of MPD and indicates that both indices can differ substantially at low species diversities. We discuss the different interpretations of trait diversity patterns in biological communities provided by Rao and MPD and then provide a simple R function, called "melodic," which avoids the unintended results that arise from existing mainstream functions.					de Bello, Francesco/H-1582-2014; Carmona, Carlos P./J-1536-2012; de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; Pärtel, Meelis/D-5493-2012; de Bello, Francesco/AFQ-8650-2022	de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; Carmona, Carlos P./0000-0001-6935-4913; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; Pärtel, Meelis/0000-0002-5874-0138; Szava-Kovats, Robert/0000-0001-7966-1327													0029-8549	1432-1939				APR	2016	180	4					933	940		10.1007/s00442-016-3546-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-016-3546-0								26796409					WOS:000373186100003

Walp.], is one of an important pulse grown throughout the world. The cowpea crop helps in fixation of atmospheric nitrogen; besides, it supports the natural enemies' population. The study on diversity of pestiferous insect associated with cowpea crop help to understand the population dynamics of these pests depending on location and seasons. These diversity studies are useful to formulate management practices which are area specific. Methods: An extensive survey was conducted at different locations (Udaipur, Bhilwara, Banswara, Chittorgarh and Pratapgarh) of southern Rajasthan during summer (Zaid) and monsoon (Kharif) seasons of 2019 and 2020. The randomly selected plants were observed for pestiferous insect population to calculate different diversity indices. Result: The insect pest complex of cowpea categorized into 5 orders viz., Hemiptera, Thysanoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera and Lepidoptera comprising 14 families. The pestiferous fauna includes population of flea beetle, jassids, whiteflies, sap sucking bugs, leaf miner, thrips, aphids, spotted pod borer and lycaenid caterpillar. During the study, it was found that overall species richness was more during the monsoon season as compared to that during the summer. The relative diversity of aphids was the maximum on account of the clumped distribution and exponential growth. In 2019, the maximum diversity was recorded in Banswara (Simpson index= 6.49 and Shannon index= 2.04) during monsoon; whereas, in 2020, the maximum diversity was recorded in Bhilwara (Simpson index= 4.03 and Shannon index= 1.81) during summer.																			0250-5371					JUN	2022	45	6					775	779	LR-4529	10.18805/LR-4529	http://dx.doi.org/10.18805/LR-4529													WOS:000814497800017

Fish Species as Eco-indicators in the Comparative Ecological Characterisation of two Creeks in the Central Niger Delta, Nigeria	WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT												Fish species have been used to compare the ecological characteristics of two surface waters in the same geo-ecological zones of the Central Niger Delta. The authors carried out 24 ecological expeditions along the Kolo and Otuoke Creeks in the Study Area for the purpose of comparing the ecological characteristics of these two surface waters that are in the same geo-ecological zone. Duplicate ecological surveys were conducted across three fishing seasons in the Study Area, and the traditional eco-livelihoods knowledge of experienced fishermen was explored during the survey to ensure that the surveys captured the spatial and temporal variation of fish species distribution of these creeks. The result of our study shows that there was no significant statistical ecological differences between the Kolo and Otuoke Creeks based on the following ecological indices: relative species percentage abundance; species richness; species diversity index; Shannon diversity index; and Simpson diversity index. Furthermore, the Bray-Curtis similarity index was used to demonstrate that the two surface waters were ecologically significantly similar. The implication of our findings is that the ecological attributes of surface water in the same geo-ecological zone are not significantly different in the absence of major environmental noise or human induced stress.																			0920-4741	1573-1650				MAY	2013	27	7					2645	2656		10.1007/s11269-013-0308-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11269-013-0308-1													WOS:000318004800045
J	Barry, J; Birchenough, S; Norris, B; Ware, S				Barry, Jon; Birchenough, Silvana; Norris, Beth; Ware, Suzanne			On the use of sample indices to reflect changes in benthic fauna biodiversity	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												This paper focuses on the difference between the value of some commonly used diversity indices (Simpson, Shannon, abundance, richness) calculated from benthic grab samples and their value in the population or region from which the samples are taken. The ability of the sample indices, as well as a recently derived relative Shannon index, to reflect change in biodiversity is examined in a short simulation study based on changing one of the diversity parameters (abundance, richness and evenness) in the population, whilst keeping the other two components constant. Our results suggest that, whilst their population equivalents do not always reflect biodiversity changes, the sample Simpson, Shannon and Richness indices perform well. We note that this will be true for any surveys where the sampling programme fails to detect many species in a population, and hence will be applicable for most benthic surveys. The use of sample indices to detect changes in biodiversity from long-running time series in the Thames and Tyne estuaries is illustrated. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 2201 insects belonging to 136 insect species under 14 insect orders were collected from old groves while 1130 insects belonging to 76 insect species under 13 insect orders were collected from a restored site. Different diversity parameters i.e., Shannon index, Simpson index, Hill diversity index and Sorenson similarity index were used to explain the insect diversity at both the sites. Results showed that only the insects belonging to orders Coleoptera and Dermaptera were significantly less in mean species number (p < 0.05) at the restored site while all other insect orders showed no significant difference in their mean species numbers between old groves and restored site. Diversity of all the insect orders was significantly less (p < 0.01) at the restored site. Termites (Infraorder Isoptera) as a group had the same diversity at both sites. Cluster analysis explained the patterns of insect plant associations. After 12 years of restoration both the sites showed 72% similarity in the insect species composition but it is expected that with the increasing age of the plant community greater habitat and food resources will be available and this will enhance the diversity of insects on the restored site.

The spatial sensitivity of the spectral diversity-biodiversity relationship: an experimental test in a prairie grassland	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Remote sensing has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range of ecosystems based on the varying spectral properties of different species or functional groups. However, the most appropriate spatial resolution necessary to detect diversity remains unclear. At coarse resolution, differences among spectral patterns may be too weak to detect. In contrast, at fine resolution, redundant information may be introduced. To explore the effect of spatial resolution, we studied the scale dependence of spectral diversity in a prairie ecosystem experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota, USA. Our study involved a scaling exercise comparing synthetic pixels resampled from high-resolution images within manipulated diversity treatments. Hyperspectral data were collected using several instruments on both ground and airborne platforms. We used the coefficient of variation (CV) of spectral reflectance in space as the indicator of spectral diversity and then compared CV at different scales ranging from 1mm(2) to 1m(2) to conventional biodiversity metrics, including species richness, Shannon's index, Simpson's index, phylogenetic species variation, and phylogenetic species evenness. In this study, higher species richness plots generally had higher CV. CV showed higher correlations with Shannon's index and Simpson's index than did species richness alone, indicating evenness contributed to the spectral diversity. Correlations with species richness and Simpson's index were generally higher than with phylogenetic species variation and evenness measured at comparable spatial scales, indicating weaker relationships between spectral diversity and phylogenetic diversity metrics than with species diversity metrics. High resolution imaging spectrometer data (1mm(2) pixels) showed the highest sensitivity to diversity level. With decreasing spatial resolution, the difference in CV between diversity levels decreased and greatly reduced the optical detectability of biodiversity. The optimal pixel size for distinguishing diversity in these prairie plots appeared to be around 1mm to 10cm, a spatial scale similar to the size of an individual herbaceous plant. These results indicate a strong scale-dependence of the spectral diversity-biodiversity relationships, with spectral diversity best able to detect a combination of species richness and evenness, and more weakly detecting phylogenetic diversity. These findings can be used to guide airborne studies of biodiversity and develop more effective large-scale biodiversity sampling methods.

Negative relationships between species richness and evenness render common diversity indices inadequate for assessing long-term trends in butterfly diversity	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Species richness and evenness, the two principle components of species diversity, are frequently used to describe variation in species assemblages in space and time. Compound indices, including variations of both the Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's index, are assumed to intelligibly integrate species richness and evenness into all-encompassing measures. However, the efficacy of compound indices is disputed by the possibility of inverse relationships between species richness and evenness. Past studies have assessed relationships between various diversity measures across survey locations for a variety of taxa, often finding species richness and evenness to be inversely related. Butterflies are one of the most intensively monitored taxa worldwide, but have been largely neglected in such studies. Long-term butterfly monitoring programs provide a unique opportunity for analyzing how trends in species diversity relate to habitat and environmental conditions. However, analyzing trends in butterfly diversity first requires an assessment of the applicability of common diversity measures to butterfly assemblages. To accomplish this, we quantified relationships between butterfly diversity measures estimated from 10 years of butterfly population data collected in the North Saskatchewan River Valley in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Species richness and evenness were inversely related within the butterfly assemblage. We conclude that species evenness may be used in conjunction with richness to deepen our understandings of assemblage organization, but combining these two components within compound indices does not produce measures that consistently align with our intuitive sense of species diversity.

It can be considered under various spatial and temporal dimensions. In forest ecosystems, which are characterized by a high degree of complexity, the whole spectrum of biodiversity can hardly be assessed. Mostly diversity of (tree-)species rather than biodiversity is quantified. Several diversity indices are presented. All indices are given as functions of proportions, by which besides species proportions of stem numbers, basal area, or Volume can be applied. Based on three hypothetical stands it is shown that the indices cannot. consistently reflect the differences in diversity between stands. Changes in diversity over time can also not be quantified without inconsistencies, as if shown with an example of six stands.																			0002-5852					APR	1996	167	4					76	85																WOS:A1996UH65600002

Additive partitioning of diversity across hierarchical spatial scales in a forested landscape	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY												1. Ecological phenomena exist at multiple scales, but measurements of diversity frequently consider only the smallest scale, that of the original sample plots. Additive partitioning of diversity allows multiple, hierarchical spatial scales of analysis to reveal the scale at which diversity is maximized. 2. We examined the spatial partitioning of diversity across 378 permanent plots established in 10 7-369-ha research natural areas (RNA) in the 294 455-ha Shawnee National Forest, Illinois, USA. Diversity (richness and Shannon's and Simpson's indices) was partitioned across four spatial scales, i.e. within and between plots, and between RNA and natural divisions (corresponding to alpha and three levels of beta diversity), for two strata of vegetation (trees and woody understorey). 3. For both strata, the highest contribution to diversity measured as species richness was between plots and between RNA. Diversity was lower than expected within plots, although Simpson's and Shannon's indices achieved their maximum values at this scale. However, Shannon's index values were higher than Simpson's index values at the between-RNA scale and for all strata, indicating that the most common species were found at this scale. 4. There was a simple asymptotic relationship between plot occupancy and local abundance, suggesting high colonization rates and rapid colonization of open habitat indicative of a wide niche breadth of the most abundant species. 5. Synthesis and applications. The implications of these findings are that maximum diversity across a forested landscape is not necessarily at the scale of sampling (i.e. within plots) but may be at higher scales corresponding to larger landscape units. Moreover, the largest contribution of richness to total diversity occurred at a larger scale than diversity expressed using measures based upon information theory, which incorporate species abundance and evenness. Conservation efforts seeking to preserve diversity must identify and target the correct scales to allow effective management. In this study, management at and within the RNA represents the most appropriate scale for conserving maximum diversity.

Water Quality Index (WQI) is used to identify the adverse effects of water quality on species diversity, richness, and evenness of the aquatic community. Physicochemical parameters (PP) such as p(H), dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, electric conductivity, salinity, biological oxygen demand, magnesium cation, and turbidity are analyzed from 27 representative sampling stations as sandchar, mining, and pit sites along the upper, middle, and lower course. Pearson correlation indicates that p(H) and magnesium cation is the most significant parameters with WQI. Principal component analysis denotes good water quality (<50) concentrated in sandchar sites, while poor (50-70) and very poor (>70) water qualities are presence in mining and pit sites. Applying Simpson's index, Simpson's index of diversity, Simpson's reciprocal index, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index on instream biota, those vary from sandchar (0.19, 0.81, 5.57, and -1.34) to mining (0.11, 0.89, 9.23, and -1.39) and pit sites (0.12, 0.90, 10.68, and -1.50). Maximum Margalef's index of species indicated the richness of species types in mining sites (4.62), with minimum mean values in sandchar sites (3.64). Contrastingly, Pielou's evenness index is high in sandchar sites (-1.05) and low in mining sites (-1.49). Therefore, significant physicochemical parameters such as P-H, dissolved oxygen, magnesium cation, and electric conductivity changes the diversity index, species richness and evenness in mining and pit along the middle and lower courses caused by sand mining.

Ants and plants as indicators of biodiversity, ecosystem services, and conservation value in constructed grasslands	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Grasslands are constructed for soil and wildlife conservation in agricultural landscapes across Europe and North America. Constructed grasslands may mitigate habitat loss for grassland-dependent animals and enhance ecosystem services that are important to agriculture. The responses of animal species richness and abundance to grassland habitat quality are often highly variable, however, and monitoring of multiple taxa is often not feasible. We evaluated whether multiple animal taxa responded to variation in constructed grassland habitats of southwest Ohio, USA, in ways that could be predicted from indicators based on quality assessment indices, Simpson diversity, and the species richness of ants and plants. The quality assessment indices included a widely used Floristic Quality Assessment (FQA) index, and a new Ant Quality Assessment (AntQA) index, both based on habitat specificity and species traits. The ant and plant indicators were used as predictor variables in separate general linear models of four target taxa-bees, beetles, butterflies and birds-with response variables of overall species richness and abundance, and subsets of taxa that included the abundance of ecosystem-service providers and grassland-associated species. Plant Simpson diversity was the best-fitting predictor variable in models of overall bee and beetle abundance, and the abundance of bees classified as ecosystem-service (ES) providers. FQA and plant richness were the best predictors of overall butterfly species richness and abundance. Ant species richness was the best predictor of overall bird species richness and abundance as well as the abundance of ES birds, while the AntQA index was the best predictor for the abundance of grassland bird and butterfly species. Thus, plant Simpson diversity and ant species richness were the most effective indicators for complementary components of grassland animal communities, whereas quality assessment indices were less robust as indicators and require more knowledge on the habitat specificity of individual ant and plant species.						, Valerie/0000-0002-0337-2577													0960-3115	1572-9710				JUL	2016	25	8					1481	1501		10.1007/s10531-016-1120-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10531-016-1120-z													WOS:000379026600005

Monitoring of tree species diversity is vital due to climate change factors. Remote sensing imagery is a means of data collection for predicting diversity of tree species. Since various sensors have different spectral and spatial resolutions, it is worth comparing them to ascertain which could influence the accuracy of prediction of tree species diversity. Hence, this study evaluated the influence of the spectral and spatial resolutions of PlanetScope, RapidEye, Sentinel 2 and Landsat 8 images in diversity prediction based on the Shannon diversity index (H '), Simpson diversity Index (D-1) and Species richness (S). The Random Forest regression was applied for the prediction using the spectral bands of the sensors as variables. The Sentinel 2 was the best image, producing the highest coefficient of determination (R-2) under both the Shannon Index (R-2 = 0.926) and the Species richness (R-2 = 0.923). Both the Sentinel and RapidEye produced comparable higher accuracy for the Simpson Index (R-2 = 0.917 and R-2 = 0.915, respectively). The PlanetScope was the second-accurate for the Species richness (R-2 = 0.90), whiles the Landsat 8 was the least accurate for the three diversity indices. The outcomes of this study suggest that both the spectral and spatial resolutions influence prediction accuracies of satellite imagery.

J	Onaindia, M; Dominguez, I; Albizu, I; Garbisu, C; Amezaga, I				Onaindia, M; Dominguez, I; Albizu, I; Garbisu, C; Amezaga, I			Vegetation diversity and vertical structure as indicators of forest disturbance	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Plant species composition and vertical structure of oak-mixed Atlantic woodlands differing on disturbance regime were studied in the Basque Country, northern Spain. Four different disturbance groups were considered depending on the time since last thinning and the presence/absence of grazers. Plant species cover varied among disturbance groups for 17 out of the total 47 species present in the study area. In general, disturbance by clear-cutting favoured the cover of Betula alba, Castanea sativa and Quercus robur. The shrub species most affected by disturbance were heathers. Among these, the most drastic effect was found for Calluna vulgaris, Daboecia cantabrica and Erica vagans which disappeared in those woodlands subjected to grazing. Several nemoral species, such as Vaccinium myrtillus, Blechnum spicant and Lamiastrum galeobdolon, were absent in these same grazed forests. By contrast, generalist species, such as Ruscus aculeatus, Geranium robertianum and Veronica officinalis, were mostly present in the grazed woodlands. Diversity was measured as Species Richness as well as with the Shannon's and Simpson's indices. Plant species richness did not vary with disturbance treatment, however, it was highest for trees and shrubs at those woodlands in an advanced stage of regeneration, and for herbs in the lowest and highest disturbance groups. Besides, only the third vertical layer (2.5-10 m) was affected by disturbance treatment. Simpson's was the best index to explain the observed differences in the structure of woodlands subjected to unalike levels of disturbance. Species diversity was highest in woodlands with lowest disturbance or in an advanced state of regeneration. Woodlands with lowest disturbance had the highest diversity of trees and those woodlands in an advanced state of regeneration showed the highest diversity of shrub species. Regarding vertical structure, diversity was mostly affected in the intermediate layer (2.5-10 m), with highest values found in woodlands at the lowest disturbance group, i.e. at least 100 years of no disturbance. Two indices of evenness, i.e. Pielou's and Simpson's were also calculated in this study. Results here presented suggest that plant species composition, percent cover of individual plant species, and the Simpson's diversity index (applied considering the different growth-forms and vertical layers) are suitable and complementary indices to evaluate disturbance at the studied woodlands.

Traditional methods have been using in situ measurements to build multivariate models connecting environmental factors to species diversity. Developments in remotely sensed datasets, processing techniques, and machine learning models provide new opportunities for assessing relevant environmental parameters and estimating species diversity. In this study, geodiversity variables containing the topographic and soil variables and multi-seasonal remote-sensing-based features were used to estimate plant diversity in a rangeland from southwest Iran. Shannon's and Simpson's indices, species richness, and vegetation cover were used to measure plant diversity and attributes in 96 plots. A random forest model was implemented to predict and map diversity indices, richness, and vegetation cover using 32 remotely sensed and 21 geodiversity variables. Additionally, the linear regression and Spearman's correlation coefficient were used to assess the relationship between the spectral diversity, expressed as the coefficient of variation in vegetation indices, and species diversity metrics. The results indicated that the synergistic use of geodiversity and multi-seasonal remotely sensed features provide the highest accuracy for Shannon, Simpson, species richness, and vegetation cover indices (R-2 up to 0.57), as compared to a single model for each date (February, April, and July). Furthermore, the strongest relationship between species diversity and the coefficient of variation in vegetation indices was based on the remotely-sensed data of April. The approach of multi-model evaluations using the full geodiversity and remotely sensed variables could be a useful method for biodiversity monitoring.					; Borz, Stelian/F-3515-2017	Nasiri, Vahid/0000-0003-2819-142X; Nasiri, Vahid/0000-0003-1861-4732; Karami, Sahar/0000-0003-0381-2787; Borz, Stelian/0000-0003-4571-7235														2072-4292				JAN	2023	15	2							387	10.3390/rs15020387	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs15020387													WOS:000916383900001

In this paper, we explore the coupling relationship between tree layer structure (competition index, angle scale, neighborhood comparison, DBH, etc.) and understory herb diversity in the transition zone of shelter forest plots near oases and near deserts; in addition, we also aim to elucidate the dominant stand structure factors affecting herb biodiversity. The results indicated the following: A total of 13 herbaceous plant species were discovered in the transitional zone, with 11 species found near the oasis area and 4 species near the desert region. The Shannon, Simpson, and Pielou indices of understory herbaceous plants were significantly higher near the oasis area compared to the desert region. The Margalef index mean was higher in the oasis area compared to the desert region. Pearson and canonical correlation analyses revealed significant associations between specific stand structure indicators and diversity in the herbaceous layer. The results of the multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the competition index had a significant impact on the Shannon, Simpson, and Pielou diversity indices of the herbaceous layer in the understory of the shelterbelt forest near the oasis, with corresponding impact coefficients of 0.911, 0.936, and 0.831, respectively. The mingling degree was found to be the primary influencing factor for the Margalef index, with an impact coefficient of 0.825. However, in the understory of the shelterbelt forest near the desert, the neighborhood comparison ratio negatively affected the Shannon and Margalef indices, with impact coefficients of -0.634 and -0.736, respectively. Additionally, tree height negatively impacted the Simpson and Pielou indices, with impact coefficients of -0.645 and -0.677, respectively. In order to enhance the diversity of understory herbaceous species in the transitional zone and preserve the ecological system of the oasis, specific modifications to the forest structure and arrangement are essential. Pruning and thinning are necessary for shelterbelt forests located near desert regions, while shelterbelt forests near oases should use a suitable mix of tree species. These measures can help preserve or enhance the diversity of understory herbaceous plants.																				1424-2818				OCT	2023	15	10							1083	10.3390/d15101083	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15101083													WOS:001094099800001
J	de Bello, F; Leps, J; Sebastià, MT				de Bello, Francesco; Leps, Jan; Sebastia, Maria-Teresa			Variations in species and functional plant diversity along climatic and grazing gradients	ECOGRAPHY												Different components of biodiversity may vary independently of each other along environmental gradients giving insights into the mechanisms that regulate species coexistence. In particular, the functional diversity (FD) or the presence of rare or endemic species in natural assemblages do not necessarily increase with species diversity. We studied if different components of plant species diversity (species richness, Simpson diversity, evenness) varied similarly to FD (measured as a generalization of the Simpson index) and rarity along grazing intensity and climatic gradients. Plots under different sheep grazing regimes (high and low intensity, abandonment) were surveyed in five locations along a climatic gradient in north-eastern Spain, from semi-arid lowland to moist upland locations. Variation in species diversity, functional diversity and rarity followed different patterns. Species diversity was lowest in water-stressed environments (arid locations and southern aspects) and increased with grazing more makedly in humid locations. The FD was comparable between the most species-poor and species-rich locations and decreased with grazing in the moistest location, i.e. where species diversity markedly increased. The FD did not show a strong correlation with species richness nor with the Simpson index and less specious communities could show the highest functional diversity. The rarest species in the region were more frequently found in the abandoned areas, which held the lowest species diversity. Consequently, the mechanisms that enhance the diversity of species do not necessarily support a functional differentiation among those species or the maintenance of rare species in a region. We hypothesize that the degree of dependence of functional diversity on species diversity might be mostly related to the amplitude of the species' traits pool and on how species partition the niche space available.					de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022; de Bello, Francesco/AFQ-8650-2022; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; Sebastia, M.

By reanalysing the mathematical model we show that rather than the number of species, Simpson and Shannon diversity indices are encoded in the experimental data. Our main tool to establish this result are the so-called Renyi diversities, closely related to Hill numbers, illustrating the power of these concepts in interpreting ecological data. We argue that the huge diversity encountered in microbial ecology can be quantified more informatively by diversity indices than by number of species.

In this study, we surveyed 49 urban green areas and 134 sample sites in Nanjing, China, according to the functional type and administrative area of each green area using typical sampling and quadrat methods. We calculated the Rhododendron shrub community quantitative characteristics index and community diversity index to evaluate the species diversity of each Rhododendron shrub community. Additionally, the indicators of rhododendron planting in each sample site were counted to understand the characteristics of the application of rhododendrons in Nanjing's urban green space and to identify the problems. According to the Simpson index and Shannon-Wiener index of the Rhododendron shrub community, road green space and Xuanwu District have relatively higher species diversity, while the Pielou index indicates that road green space and Jianye District have relatively higher species evenness. A total of 11 Rhododendron cultivars were found in this survey, among which R. simsii 'ZiHuDie' was the most widely used cultivar in Nanjing urban greenery; however, this result shows that the applied Rhododendron cultivars are too homogeneous. This study highlights problems affecting Nanjing urban greening and can be used as a reference for future Rhododendron breeding research.					liu, xiao/HMD-7454-2023; Liu, Ying/ISU-1216-2023; liu, xq/JDW-2596-2023														0564-3295	2661-8982				2022 DEC	2022	63	4					506	521		10.1007/s42965-022-00219-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42965-022-00219-z		FEB 2022											WOS:000757146200001

INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Biodiversity being a multidimensional property is always considered as tough to measure or quantify mostly because of the assortment of indices recommended for this purpose. However, there is no agreement about which indices are more appropriate and informative. Arthropods are one of the groups that have evaded the knowledge of human beings of their role in ecosystem function. We used data collected from floricultural ecosystems of rose, jasmine and cock's comb fields during 2016 in Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu and calculated common arthropod diversity indices of species richness and species dominance in ordinal, familial and species level. The aim was to find out whether surrogacy is possible as far as arthropod diversity analyses are concerned and to determine whether some were better suited than others. In the present study, it was found that in most of the cases, irrespective of the index used, estimating species richness based on family level presented a closer picture to that of species level analysis, but could not totally replicate the sensitivity reflected by species level classification. Of the three dominance indices, only the Simpson's index discriminated the variation at all the three levels, viz. ordinal, familial and species with the discrimination being more pronounced at the species level. Hence, it could be inferred that the Simpson index could successfully be used in the floricultural ecosystems for estimating arthropod diversity based on dominance measures.

The purpose of this study was to describe the different types of fishing gear that are available with their characteristics, fish species assemblage and to assess the fish diversity status through sampling in five sampling stations during the study period. A total of 16 different types of fishing gears were discovered in the study, which were divided into eight major categories. There were 61 fish species found in total under 9 orders, 26 families and 45 genera. Cypriniformes (48.02%) was found to be the most dominant order, followed by Perciformes (17.07%), Siluriformes (15.96%), Synbranchiformes (9.33%), Clupeiformes (6.28%), and others (3.35%). Indices of Population viz. Shannon-Wiener's Index (H), Simpson's Dominance Index (D), Simpson's Diversity Index (1-D), Margalef's Index (d) and Gibson's Evenness (euro) were used to display species diversity, fish species richness and evenness in sampling areas and the overall values of the indices were 3.36-3.64, 0.033-0.048, 0.952-0.966, 4.74-6.02 and 0.64-0.73 respectively. There was a strong negative correlation between Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Dominance diversity index (r =-0.80936) and a moderate negative correlation between Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Evenness diversity index (r =-0.39911). According to Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis 67.29% similarity were found among the stations and 64.71% similarity were observed among the months of fish species. Among 61 fish species of different sampling stations found 5 species are critically endangered (CR), 11 species are endangered (EN) and 12 species are vulnerable according to IUCN red list (2015).																			1872-2032					JUN	2022	42	3					243	253		10.1016/j.chnaes.2022.03.004	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chnaes.2022.03.004													WOS:001108352900009

The present study is an attempt to investigate the measures of finfish diversity of the Poonthura estuary, located in Thiruvananthapuram district of Kerala, India. Samples were collected using gill nets from three stations. Biodiversity indices such as Margalef's richness (d), Pielou's evenness (J'), Shannon diversity (H') loge(2), Simpson diversity (1-), Simpson dominance (), average taxonomic distinctness (o+), and variation in taxonomic distinctness (+) were worked out for monthly and seasonal data (pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon). The ranges of species richness, evenness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity and dominance were 2.30 to 4.51, 0.79 to 0.92, 2.52 to 3.42, 0.76 to 0.91, and 0.11 to 0.23 respectively. Considering the lacuna in information on this estuary, the results of the present study provide reference points for the measures of fish diversity for future studies. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) plotted to understand the seasonal and monthly variation of diversity. The clusters showed 40% similarity in the monthly samples, with the post-monsoon season showing the highest number of species. Various physicochemical parameters influenced the temporal fluctuations in diversity including seasons, river runoff, sewage discharge, and intrusion of saline water. Moreover, higher values of chlorophyll a is an indicator of eutrophication. Proper management inputs are necessary to sustain the resources along with pollution abatement measures for improving the livelihood support from this estuary.

Based on the results of cluster analysis of species compositions of copepods collected, we could distinguish 3 copepod species composition groups, each associated with one of the 3 different water masses. The 1st group was associated with the Kuroshio Branch Current. It had high values for Shannon's species diversity and Simpson's species evenness indices. The dominant species in this group were Temora turbinata, Paracalanus parvus and Canthocalanus pauper. The 2nd group was associated with the China Coastal Current. It had low values for Shannon's diversity and Simpson's evenness indices, and its dominant species were P. parvus, Euchaeta sp., and Calanus sinicus. The 3rd group was found in the area receiving freshwater intrusion from the Tanshui River of Taiwan. It had the lowest values for Shannon's diversity and Simpson's evenness indices among the 3 groups.

Financial, personnel, and labor inputs of 38 agencies were analyzed in relation to the level of workforce diversity achieved by each decision-making unit (DMU). The Simpson index of diversity (D = 1 - Sigma p(2)) was used to measure the level of age, ethnic, and gender diversity in each agency. The findings suggest that the majority of the agencies have inefficient human resource (HR) recruiting and hiring processes (constant returns-to-scale [CRS] > 1.000 and Sigma lambda > 1.000). The findings also suggest that the inefficient agencies would exhibit decreasing returns-to-scale (DRS) if the level of inputs were to be increased.																			0091-0260	1945-7421				JUN	2015	44	2					239	265		10.1177/0091026015575179	http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0091026015575179													WOS:000353975800005

Buffer analysis and Mann-Kendall's test were used to quantify the relationships between distance from transportation routes (railway, highway, national, and provincial road) and a family of landscape diversity parameters (Simpson's diversity index, Simpson's evenness index, Shannon's diversity index, and Shannon's evenness index). One-way ANOVA was further applied to compare influences from different route types and their combined effects. Five other landscape metrics (patch density, edge density, area-weighted mean shape index, connectance index, and Euclidean nearest neighbor distance) were also calculated to analyze the associations between landscape diversity and landscape pattern characteristics. Results showed that transportation routes exerted significant impacts on landscape diversity. Impact from railway was comparable to that from highway and national road but was more significant than that from provincial road. The spatial influential range of railway and national road was wider than that of highway and provincial road. Combined effects of routes were nonlinear, and impacts from different route types were more complex than those from the same type. The four landscape diversity metrics were comparably effective at the buffer zone scale. In addition, landscape diversity can be alternatively used to indicate fragmentation, connectivity, and isolation at route buffer scale. This study demonstrates an applicable approach to quantitatively characterize the impacts from transportation routes on landscape patterns and has potential to facilitate route network planning.

A total of 11,038 ant workers belonging to 40 species, 25 genera of 10 tribes, and six subfamilies were recorded. The Simpson index of diversity (1-D) was 0.97, indicating greater diversity in both vegetative and human habitat. Similarly, the Shannon index was 3.40 and 3.50 for both vegetative and human habitats, respectively, indicating assemblage of similar ant species in both habitats. In contrast, for agricultural habitat, Simpson index of diversity (1-D) was 0.90, and for dry land habitat, the least diversity of 0.80 was reported. However, in pair-wise comparisons, no significant difference was observed between agriculture and dry land and vegetative and human habitats. The agriculture and arid land habitats tend to have fewer species compared with the vegetative and human habitats. Human-disturbed areas have an important role as reservoirs of biodiversity and should be included in landscape management practices to improve ant conservation in the tropics.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				FEB 25	2021	193	3							145	10.1007/s10661-021-08941-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-021-08941-2								33629184					WOS:000623840700001
J	del Valle, I; Astorkiza, K				del Valle, I; Astorkiza, K.			Exploring cross correlation among diversity indices	FISHERIES RESEARCH												This paper analysed cross correlations among multispecies and single species bio-economic diversity measures related to a local dynamic fisheries ecosystem along the period {1986:1-2014:12}. We focused on bio-economic Simpson, Shannon and multispecies Berger Parker indexes (our proposal of multispecies pure leadership indicator) and the percentage share of income of anchovy and mackerel. These two species were chosen because they showed the highest correlation with the multispecies diversity indices, and led, respectively the "antidiversity" and "prodiversity" groups of species within the ecosystem. Time series were subjected to a double treatment to avoid the potential for spurious and biased correlations. First, the long run and seasonal cycles were removed by means of a cyclical ARFIMA modelling approach. Second, the time series were pre-whitened using conventional ARMA modelling. Correlations between the multispecies indices were remarkably high and hardly changed with the pre-whitening procedure. Conversely, the correlations of the multispecies indicators with the income shares of the two leading species decreased to almost the half after pre-withening, but still remained significant. The concentration in our particular ecosystem is high (i.e. diversity low) and it is significantly correlated with the income shares of the leading species. Accordingly, the risk of collapse for the local fishing sector is high.

In this study, we investigate the interplay between genetic risk and gut microbial markers. Methods: We included 159 first-episode, drug-naive SCZ patients and 86 healthy controls. The microbial composition of feces was characterized using the 16S rRNA sequencing platform, and five microbial alpha-diversity indices were estimated [Shannon, Simpson, Chao1, the Abundance-based Eoverage Estimator (ACE), and a phylogenetic diversity-based estimate (PD)]. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for SCZ were constructed using data from large-scale genome-wide association studies. Effects of microbial alpha-diversity, microbial abundance, and PRS on SCZ were evaluated via generalized linear models. Results: We confirmed that PRS was associated with SCZ (OR = 2.08, p = 1.22x10(-5)) and that scores on the Shannon (OR = 0.29, p = 1.15x10(-8)) and Simpson (OR = 0.29, p = 1.25x10(-8)) indices were inversely associated with SCZ risk. We found significant interactions (p < 0.05) between PRS and alpha-diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson, and PD), with the effects of PRS being larger in those exhibiting higher diversity compared to those with lower diversity. Moreover, the PRS effects were larger in individuals with a high abundance of the genera Romboutsia, Streptococcus, and Anaerostipes than in those with low abundance (p < 0.05). All three of these genera showed protective effects against SCZ. Conclusion: The current findings suggest an interplay between the gut microbiota and polygenic risk of SCZ that warrants replication in independent samples. Experimental studies are needed to determine the underpinning mechanisms.																			1664-0640					FEB 1	2024	15								1275719	10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1275719	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2024.1275719								38362027					WOS:001162419200001

LAND												Land resources are important for millions of rural households in China. With the land tenure system reform and the trend of nonfarm employment, land transfer affects household income and consumption diversity significantly. Utilizing the data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) 2018, this study investigated the effects of land transfer on Chinese rural households' consumption diversity, measured by the Simpson index. In order to mitigate the endogeneity problems caused by reverse causality and selection bias between farmers' household land transfer decisions and consumption behavior, we employed the propensity score matching (PSM) method and instrumental variable (IV) method. Besides, the Shannon index was also used to measure consumption diversity for the robustness test. The results showed that the rural households who have transferred others' land in would decrease their consumption diversity, while the households who have transferred their land out would increase their consumption diversity. Heterogeneity analysis showed that land transfer had different degrees of impact on rural households with different income groups and was more significant for low-income households. Specifically, compared with higher-income households, both the promotion effect of land transfer out and the inhibitory effect of land transfer on consumption diversity were more obvious for lower-income households.					wang, hang/JND-8481-2023; Chen, Xin/JDN-2017-2023; Li, jiaqi/JOZ-6395-2023; yang, yue/KCK-7870-2024; liu, huan/JEO-4705-2023; luo, yuan/JLS-6416-2023; wang, wenxin/JOZ-3291-2023; Liu, Yilin/JWP-9153-2024; LIU, HUI/JPX-8014-2023; Wang, Hao/ABB-8923-2020; zhang, zheng/KBQ-7815-2024; liu, huan/JKI-3764-2023; Yu, Yue/JWP-9103-2024; wang, yixuan/JGM-3893-2023; zhang, yueqi/JXM-4287-2024; Li, Gang/HKE-4664-2023; wang, hao/JKH-5890-2023; Wang, Minghao/JMD-0670-2023; Xufeng, Cui/GMX-2978-2022	Liu, Yilin/0000-0002-7581-3933; Wang, Hao/0000-0001-9109-6017; Li, Gang/0000-0001-8807-4298; Xufeng, Cui/0000-0002-8016-5192; Pan, Lan/0000-0003-1266-6507														2073-445X				JAN	2023	12	1							203	10.3390/land12010203	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12010203													WOS:000917475700001

Diversity of antimicrobial use and resistance in 42 hospitals in the United States	PHARMACOTHERAPY					44th Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy	OCT 30-NOV 02, 2004	Washington, DC					Study Objective. To measure diversity (or heterogeneity) of antibiotic use in a sample of hospitals in the United States and to assess an association with bacterial resistance. Design. Observational cross-sectional study. Setting. Forty-two general medical-surgical hospitals, mostly in the Eastern United States. Data Source. Administrative claims data and hospital antibiograms during 2003. Measurements and Main Results. Antibiotic use was measured by defined daily dose (DDD), and diversity was assessed by using Simpson's Index and the Shannon-Weiner Index. Aggregated antibiograms (from 17 hospitals) were used to assess resistance. There were a total of 3,655,579 patient-days during 2003, with a mean +/- SD of 87,037 +/- 62,679 patient-days/hospital. Mean SD antibiotic use was 704 +/- 244 DDD/1000 patient-days/hospital, and fluoroquinolones represented the largest single class. Mean SD diversity by Simpson's Index was 0.861 +/- 0.022/hospital, and a strong correlation was noted between the two diversity measures. Multivariate analysis found no significant relationship between diversity and the proportion of resistant pathogens. Conclusion. Diversity of aggregate antibiotic use can be measured, but additional investigations are needed to determine if it is a useful strategy to contain resistance.

Identical microbial fuel cells were sampled at multiple time-points. Biofilm and suspension communities were analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to calculate the number and relative abundance of species. Shannon and Simpson indices and richness were examined for association with power using bivariate and multiple linear regression, with biofilm DNA as an additional variable. In simple bivariate regressions, the correlation of Shannon diversity of the biofilm and power is stronger (r = 0.65, p = 0.001) than between power and richness (r = 0.39, p = 0.076), or between power and the Simpson index (r = 0.5, p = 0.018). Using Shannon diversity and biofilm DNA as predictors of power, a regression model can be constructed (r = 0.73, p < 0.001). Ecological parameters such as the Shannon index are predictive of the electrogenic potential of microbial communities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

(Shoot and fruit borer of brinjal)	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Soil samples were collected from agricultural fields and gardens in North 24 Parganas, West Bengal, and fungi species were isolated from them. Thirty-one fungal species were isolated with 19 found in agricultural soil and 28 in garden soil. Twenty-eight out of 31 were identified using cultural and microscopic characters, and three were unidentified. The diversity of isolated fungi was calculated by Simpson's diversity index. The garden soil possessed more fungal colonies (750) than agricultural soil (477). In agricultural soil, the dominant fungi were Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus oryzae, and Penicillium expansum, and the dominant fungi of garden soil were A. niger and Fusarium moniliforme. Simpson's diversity index indicated that garden soil had more fungal diversity (0.939) than agricultural soil (0.896). The entomopathogenic capacity of the isolated fungi was tested against the brinjal shoot and fruit borer (Leucinodes orbonalis Guen) which is the major insect pest of brinjal. The isolated fungi were screened against larva of L. orbonalis for their entomopathogenic potential. Beauveria bassiana, A. niger, and P. expansum showed appreciable antagonism to L. orbonalis, and their lethal doses with 50 % mortality (LD(50)s) were 4.0 x 10(7), 9.06 x 10(7), and 1.50 x 10(8) spore/mL, respectively, and their times taken to reach 50 % mortality (LT(50)s) were 9.77, 10.56, and 10.60 days, respectively. This work suggests the restriction of chemical pesticide application in agricultural fields to increase fungal diversity. The entomopathogenic efficacy of B. bassiana could be used in agricultural fields to increase fugal diversity and protect the brinjal crop.

Samples were collected using Calvet (modified PairOVET) plankton net at 18 stations, from July 2006 through January 2009. Families with most numerous species were Engraulidae, Sparidae and Labridae. Investigation shows dominance of anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), Mediterranean rainbow wrasse (Coris julis) and annular sea bream (Diplodus annularis) during the summer. During the winter, dominant species were sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), while during the spring dominant species were anchovy, annular sea bream and white sea bream (Diplodus sargus). Spawning of most pelagic fish species in Adriatic Sea starts in spring, and progress during spring and summer months. Therefore, the highest number of species was found in these months, while the lowest number of species was during autumn and winter surveys. Eggs and larval stages of 35 species was determined, while the diversity analysis showed a significant degree of diversity in certain stations where the sea currents were probably the strongest. Diversity of ichthyoplankton communities was analyzed applying two diversity indices: Shannon index (H') and Simpson index (D). Diversity analysis was performed for each of the 18 investigated stations during the tree-year research, while influence of environmental factors on presence of some ichthyoplankton species by seasons was tested with Canonical Correspondence Analyses (CCA).

Diversity of phytoplanktons in a waste stabilization pond at Shimoga Town, Karnataka State, India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												To understand the diversity of phytoplanktons in waste stabilization pond effluents the hitherto study is undertaken. Species diversity indices of Shannon-Wiener and Simpson were applied to phytoplanktons. The diversity indices are of mathematical function to explain the abundance of each species. The total numbers of algae identified were 71 species belonging to Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceace and Desmidaceae. Chlorella and Scenedesmus were the dominant forms among the algal genera throughout the study period. Phytoplanktons play a vital role in improving the water quality of wastewater in waste stabilization ponds. Diversity indices provide important information about rarity and commonness of species in a community. The diversity indices of all the species explained the water was moderately polluted with less diversity level and highest possible equal number of different species of phytoplanktons. Greater impact of pollution leads to the lesser diversity of phytoplanktons.																			0167-6369					APR	2009	151	1-4					437	443		10.1007/s10661-008-0287-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-008-0287-5								18523855					WOS:000263832800042

The aim of this paper is to study the effects of the exotic Acacia saligna on native plant biodiversity of northern part of Jordan. Within each studied area we estimated plant species cover in six replicates of a 0.5 m(2) quadrate distributed randomly inside and outside the canopy of A. saligna. From these plant cover we estimated the total number of species, Shannon's diversity index, Simpson's diversity index and Margalef's diversity index of the associated annual and perennial species. The overall results showed that the effect of A. saligna on plant diversity depends largely on the proximity to the tree canopy. Namely, it has been found that native plant species diversity such as Shannon's diversity index, Simpson's diversity index are reduced under canopy (1.88, 0.8831) compared to the outside canopy of the trees (2.21, 0.876), respectively (One-way ANOVA; F = 14.99, 12.46; P-values<0.001). Moreover, observed and cumulative species richness of native plant biodiversity of Jordan is significantly affected by the presence of this exotic tree. It can be concluded that competition and intrinsic characteristics of tree i.e., nutrient uptake efficiency, are among the possible mechanisms responsible for the impact of A. saligna trees on native plants of Jordan.

W.; Arbuckle, Kevin			Diversity Begets Diversity When Diet Drives Snake Venom Evolution, but Evenness Rather Than Richness Is What Counts	TOXINS												Snake venoms are primarily used to subjugate prey, and consequently, their evolution has been shown to be predominantly driven by diet-related selection pressure. Venoms tend to be more lethal to prey than non-prey species (except in cases of toxin resistance), prey-specific toxins have been identified, and preliminary work has demonstrated an association between the diversity of diet classes and that of toxicological activities of whole venom. However, venoms are complex mixtures of many toxins, and it remains unclear how toxin diversity is driven by diet. Prey-specific toxins do not encompass the molecular diversity of venoms, and whole venom effects could be driven by one, few, or all components, so the link between diet and venom diversity remains minimally understood. Here, we collated a database of venom composition and diet records and used a combination of phylogenetic comparative methods and two quantitative diversity indices to investigate whether and how diet diversity relates to the toxin diversity of snake venoms. We reveal that venom diversity is negatively related to diet diversity using Shannon's index but positively related using Simpson's index. Since Shannon's index predominantly considers the number of prey/toxins, whereas Simpson's index more strongly reflects evenness, we provide insights into how the diet-venom diversity link is driven. Specifically, species with low diet diversity tend to have venoms dominated by a few abundant (possibly specialised) toxin families, whereas species with diverse diets tend to 'hedge their bets' by having venoms with a more even composition of different toxin classes.

Objective of this study is to assess and compare the beetle diversity at three selected lower elevational mountains to enlighten our understanding. Measuring the beetle diversity at Fraser???s hill, Gunung Besar Hantu and Gunung Angsi at lower altitudinal (500 m) cline was selected for sampling, where light, malaise and pitfall traps were utilized during 2013-2014 season. Altogether from these three sampling sites 1,575 beetle samples were collected and they went through with some diversity analysis. The Margalef index for Gunung Besar Hantu, Fraser???s Hill and Gunung Angsi showed 9.210, 7.214 and 6.777 respectively while Shannon-Weaner index ranged between 2.546 to 3.083. Evenness is very high at Gunung Angsi (0.930) and Fraser???s hill showed moderate level (0.51). Simpson diversity index is ranging from 0.859 to 0.946 while Shannon Weiner diversity index showed very close values for Gunung Besar Hantu and Gunung Angsi but slightly lower value for Fraser???s Hill. Highest Simpson diversity index and highest evenness index were shown by Gunung Angsi. Lower elevational ecoregions of Malaysian tropical mountains are good laboratories to assess beetle diversity which can be utilized for climate change studies and ecological disturbances. Long term monitoring program between different mountains on beetle diversity and distribution would enhance the understanding of their habitat pattern in relation to seasonal pattern and anthropogenic disturbances.

The relationships between the indices and a number of independent variables such as topography, geology, soil, climate, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and land cover were investigated to understand relationships between plant diversity and ecosystem. Georeferenced field data from the established 56 quadrats (50 x 20 m) were used to calculate the indices. Principle component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression were employed for data reduction and model development, respectively. Three diversity maps were produced using the developed models. Residual maps and logical interpretations in ecological point of view were used to test the validity of the models. Elevation and climatic factors formed the most important components that are effective determinants of plant species diversity, but geological formations, soil, land cover and land-use characteristics also influenced plant diversity. Considering the different responses of the models, Shannon-Wiener (SWI) and NS models were found suitable for rare cover types, while Simpson (SIMP) model might be appropriate for single dominant land covers in the study area.

J	Strong, WL				Strong, W. L.			Assessing species abundance unevenness within and between plant communities	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												A simple to calculate and statistically testable method is proposed for assessing species abundance unevenness or dominance concentration within plant communities. Dominance rather than evenness is considered the preferred measure, because perfect evenness can be defined and used as a benchmark for comparing communities regardless of floristic richness. Four dominance (Simpson, Berger-Parker, McIntosh, and a proposed [D-W]) and four evenness (Carmargo, Gini, Shannon, and Williams) indices are comparatively analyzed. The Simpson, McIntosh, Gini, and Williams indices were correlated with species richness, the Berger-Parker index was correlated with total species cover, the Shannon index over-estimated evenness, the Simpson index under-estimated dominance concentration, and a nonlinear relationship occurred between the Simpson and all of the evenness indices. OnlyD(W)and the Carmargo indices fulfilled the technical requirements established for evenness with appropriate reversals of criteria for assessing a dominance concentration index. Determination ofD(W)was based on the maximum difference between cumulative proportion (also referred to as Lorenz curve or partial order) and perfect evenness values. The conventional assumption that dominance (D) is the complete opposite of evenness (E), as assessed by indices, was found in practice to be lacking, without the inclusion of an error term (i.e., 1 =E+D+ error). Therefore, both dominance concentration and evenness should be reported when characterizing plant communities.																			1585-8553	1588-2756				JUN	2002	3	2					237	246		10.1556/ComEc.3.2002.2.9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/ComEc.3.2002.2.9													WOS:000558875400009

The present study was conducted to evaluate effects of elevation gradient on biodiversity in a temperate mountainous forest. For collection of trees' diversity data, 44 sample plots 20 x 20 m(2) were set up every 50 m of the elevation interval at the altitude ranging from 100 m to 2250 m a.s.l. Also for collection of data on herbaceous vegetation, five microplots (1 x 2 m) were established (one microplot in the center and four microplots in the four corners of the plot). Species diversity values were analyzed using Simpson and modified Shannon Wiener indices. Also, species richness was calculated using Margalef and SmithWilson indices for each plot. The results from Simpson and modified Shannon Wiener biodiversity indices imply approximately bell-shaped diversity curves with the greatest species richness at medium elevations (800-1300 m a.s.l). However, if ecotones (gradual changes between two communities) are excluded, one can conclude that species biodiversity decreases with increasing elevation. The lowland community has the least richness that can be the result of the anthropogenic pressure. The evenness indices for the forest sites along the elevation gradient detected no trend with increasing elevation.

Most studies on plant diversity in forests focus on adult trees, while the abiotic drivers of forest seedling community characteristics are less understood. Here, we studied seedling banks' composition, richness, diversity, and abundance, and investigated their relationships with microsite abiotic conditions along a wide elevational gradient. We sampled seedling communities in 312 1-m(2) quadrats, distributed in 13 one-ha plots in four subtropical forests in south China, covering an elevation gradient of 1500 m, for 2 years. We measured light availability, slope, and 11 soil nutrients for each seedling quadrat. We used analysis of similarities and multivariate analysis of variance to compare the composition and abiotic drivers of the four forests' seedling communities. We then used mixed models and structural equation modeling to test the direct and indirect effects of abiotic factors on seedling species richness, diversity, and abundance. The differences in seedling community composition among these forests were mostly explained by differences in elevations and soil nutrients. Seedling diversity as Shannon and Simpson diversity index decreased with increasing elevation and increased with increasing slope, but seedling abundance and species richness did not. Elevation had an indirect effect on Simpson's diversity index through modulating the direct effects of soil properties. Our findings show that soil properties play a prominent role in favoring differentiation in species composition among the four forests we studied and provide additional evidence to decreasing species diversity with elevation. However, this was reflected in decreasing Shannon and Simpson indices rather than species richness, which is more commonly studied. Whether and to what extent future environmental changes in climate and soil acidification will alter future forest composition and diversity needs to be investigated.

The diversity and dominance of crop plantations in the agroecosystems in communes were calculated based on percentage share of 21 kinds of crops in the cropland structure. The algorithms applied in ecological research of biodiversity were used: the Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H') and Simpson's dominance index (lambda). The diversity (H') of crops in arable land in the Kujawy and Pomorze Province ranges from 1.68 to 2.54. The diversity of crop plantations in the region was bigger in the communes in which there are: better soil, a higher share of arable land in the agricultural acreage and cropland in the arable land as well as with a higher share of barley, corn for grain and sugar beet in the cropland structure. The highest dominance index (lambda) for crops in the whole province is 0.291. The index of dominance of agricultural crops in this region increases with an increase in the share of: woodland in the total area, meadows and pasture in the agricultural acreage and rye in the cropland structure.

J	Baczkowski, AJ; Joanes, DN; Shamia, GM				Baczkowski, AJ; Joanes, DN; Shamia, GM			Properties of a generalized diversity index	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												Diversity indices attempt to summarize both the total number of species in a population and the degree of evenness of the species relative abundances. A general diversity index, H(alpha,beta), was proposed by Good (1953) and defined for alpha and beta non-negative integers. For example, H(1, 1) and H(2, 0) are two popular diversity indices due to Shannon (1948) and Simpson (1949) respectively. This paper presents results extending alpha and beta to include any real values under two desirable properties due to Pielou (1975). The evenness and richness components of diversity have been examined and optimal choices of alpha and beta discussed, particularly for the equiprobable and broken-stick models of abundance.

J	Carugo, O				Carugo, Oliviero			Hydrophobicity diversity in globular and nonglobular proteins measured with the Gini index	PROTEIN ENGINEERING DESIGN & SELECTION												Amino acids and their properties are variably distributed in proteins and different compositions determine all protein features, ranging from solubility to stability and functionality. Gini index, a tool to estimate distribution uniformity, is widely used in macroeconomics and has numerous statistical applications. Here, Gini index is used to analyze the distribution of hydrophobicity in proteins and to compare hydrophobicity distribution in globular and intrinsically disordered proteins. Based on the analysis of carefully selected high-quality data sets of proteins extracted from the Protein Data Bank (http://www.rcsb.org) and from the DisProt database (http://www.disprot.org/), it is observed that hydrophobicity is distributed in a more diverse way in intrinsically disordered proteins than in folded and soluble globular proteins. This correlates with the observation that the amino acid composition deviates from the uniformity (estimate with the Shannon and the Gini-Simpson indices) more in intrinsically disordered proteins than in globular and soluble proteins. Although statistical tools tike the Gini index have received little attention in molecular biology, these results show that they allow one to estimate sequence diversity and that they are useful to delineate trends that can hardly be described, otherwise, in simple and concise ways.

Assessing regional geodiversity: the Iberian Peninsula	EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS												Geodiversity is a landscape characteristic related to the heterogeneity of the physical properties of the earth surface. in this work, we quantify and compare geodiversity in several geodynamic zones of the Iberian Peninsula. For this purpose, we have developed a geographic information system (GIS) procedure to carry out a regional terrain classification based on geodiversity factors. A classification process helped to produce a morphometric map (10 classes), a morphoclimatic map (five classes) and a geological map (15 classes). These three maps were combined using an overlay operation (union) to obtain the final terrain classification (419 classes), which was then applied to calculate diversity landscape indices. The latter were calculated using common landscape diversity indices (Patch Richness Density, Shannon's Diversity Index, Shannon's Evenness Index, Simpson's Diversity Index and Simpson's Evenness Index), provided by FRAGSTATS free software. These indices were calculated for the whole landscape of the main Iberian geological regions, thus revealing a close relationship between some index values and the geological and geomorphological characteristics. The highest diversity values are associated with Alpine collisional orogens and reactivated chains of the Precambrian-Palaeozoic massif. Intraplate orogen with sedimentary cover, characterized by extensive planation surfaces, have lower values. Mesozoic areas with no significant tectonic deformation and Cenozoic basins are characterized by the lowest diversity values. Amongst the latter, the major diversity is associated with the most dissected basins, which also present higher morphoclimatic variety. Though depending on the chosen scale and the landscape classification criteria, these indices provide an objective assessment of the regional geodiversity of Iberia.

However, grasslands in alpine regions of China are severely degraded, and the effects of land-use types on species composition, soil nutrients, and ecosystem multifunctionality of degraded alpine grasslands are less certain. To ascertain the effects of main land-use types (no-tillage reseeding and fertilization) on species diversity and ecosystem multifunctionality in alpine grasslands, we investigated the changes in these factors by subjecting specified areas. Using a standardized field survey, we measured the cover, richness, and evenness of plants. At each site, we measured microbial diversity and twelve soil variables critical for maintaining ecosystem multifunctionality in alpine grasslands. The results showed that: (1) the Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices of plant community, and fungal diversity indices increased significantly in no-tillage reseeding and fertilization; (2) at the phyla level, the relative abundances of Basidiomycota, Olpidiomycota, and Proteobacteria increased significantly in no-tillage reseeding and fertilization, as well as, at the genus level, those of Coniochaeta, Solirubrobacter, Pseudonocardia, and Microvirga; (3) the soil physicochemical properties (except the C:N of soil) increased significantly in no-tillage reseeding and fertilization; (4) correlation analysis showed that species diversity was mainly correlated with soil nutrients in control check, while it was mainly correlated with soil physical properties in no-tillage reseeding and fertilization; (5) linear regression analysis showed significant positive relationships between Margalef, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices of plant community and ecosystem multifunctionality. In addition, ecosystem multifunctionality was positively related to Pielou, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices of the fungal community and it was positively related to Pielou and Shannon-Wiener indices of bacterial community. These observations indicated that no-tillage reseeding and fertilization of degraded alpine grasslands had the potential to improve ecosystem functions in many ways.

Remote sensing for obtaining large-scale spatial distribution information of tree species diversity is a geoscience research hotspot to overcome the limitations of conventional tree species diversity survey approaches. Airborne LiDAR or synergy with airborne optical imagery has been used to model and estimate tree species diversity for specific forest communities, with many revealing results. However, the data collection for such research is costly, the breadth of monitoring findings is limited, and obtaining information on the geographical pattern is challenging. To this end, we propose a method for mapping forest tree species diversity by synergy satellite optical remote sensing and satellite-based LiDAR based on the spectral heterogeneity hypothesis and structural variation hypothesis to improve the accuracy of the remote sensing monitoring of forest tree species diversity while considering data cost. The method integrates horizontal spectral variation from GF-1/PMS image data with vertical structural variation from ICESat-2 spot data to estimate the species diversity of trees. The findings reveal that synergistic horizontal spectral variation and vertical structural variation overall increase tree species diversity prediction accuracy compared to a single remote sensing variation model. The synergistic approach improved Shannon and Simpson indices prediction accuracy by 0.06 and 0.04, respectively, compared to the single horizontal spectral variation model. The synergistic model, single vertical structural variation model, and single horizontal spectral variation model were the best prediction models for Shannon, Simpson, and richness indices, with R-2 of 0.58, 0.62, and 0.64, respectively. This research indicates the potential of synergistic satellite-based LiDAR and optical remote sensing in large-scale forest tree species diversity mapping.						shu, qing tai/0000-0002-7425-1158														1999-4907				AUG	2023	14	8							1537	10.3390/f14081537	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f14081537													WOS:001055468800001

Four rarefaction approaches (richness, Shannon's entropy, Simpson's diversity, and max-entropy) were implemented as an algorithm and run 10,000 times. Our results showed similar patterns of richness in natural compounds according to genus and of Simpson's diversity index while max-entropy has a similar pattern as Shannon's entropy. The analysis of both richness in active compounds and weight of most frequent extracted compound revealed that Dracocephalum genus is most suitable for propagation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Gut Microbial Diversity in Antibiotic-Naive Children After Systemic Antibiotic Exposure: A Randomized Controlled Trial	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES												Background. Antibiotic exposure can alter the gut microbiome. We evaluate the effects of azithromycin on the gut microbiome diversity of children from an antibiotic-naive community in Niger. Methods. A population-based sample of 80 children aged 1-60 months in the Dosso region of Niger was randomized to receive a single dose of either oral azithromycin or placebo. Fecal samples were collected immediately before treatment and 5 days after treatment for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The prespecified outcome was a-diversity (inverse Simpson's alpha-diversity index), with secondary outcomes of beta and gamma Simpson's and Shannon's diversities. Results. At 5 days after treatment, 40 children aged 1-60 months were analyzed in the azithromycin-treated group and 40 children in the placebo-treated group. Diversity of the gut microbiome was significantly lower in the treated group (inverse Simpson's a-diversity, 5.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 4.08-6.14) than in the placebo group (6.91; 95% CI, 5.82-8.21; P = .03). Similarly, the Shannon's alpha-diversity was lower in the treated group (10.60; 95% CI, 8.82-12.36) than the placebo group (15.42; 95% CI, 13.24-17.80; P =.004). Simpson's community-level (gamma) diversity decreased with azithromycin exposure from 17.72 (95% CI, 13.80-20.21) to 10.10 (95% CI, 7.80-11.40; P =.00008), although beta-diversity was not significantly reduced (2.56, 95% CI, 1.88-3.12; to 2.01, 95% CI, 1.46-2.51; P = .26). Conclusions. Oral administration of azithromycin definitively decreases the diversity of the gut microbiome of children in an antibiotic-naive community.

The diversity of macrofungi comprised 51 species belonging to 22 families and 37 genera. The families Agaricaceae (7 species) and Psathyrellaceae (7 species) were found dominant followed by Tricholomataceae (4 species), Fomitopsidaceae and Polyporaceae (4 species each) and Amanitaceae (3 species). White (23 species), brown (11 species), and yellow were the most prevalent morphological colours in basidiocarps (8 species). Among the identified species, 32 were saprophytic in nutrition followed by 7 parasitic, 6 saprophytic and parasitic both, while 6 mycorrhizal that make association with higher plants. The distribution of macro-fungal species in the three tehsils of Bajaur was also evaluated based on Shannon diversity index, Simpson diversity index and evenness. The highest Shannon diversity index and Simpson di-versity index were found for tehsil Utman Kheil at 3.73 and 0.97, while the maximum value of evenness for tehsil Khar with 0.92 value. The results indicate a very high species richness of the study site. Four species out of the total were identified to be new reports from Pakistan. This survey's findings suggested that there is a wide variety of macrofungi that might be used as food and alternative medications if further research is carried out.

An approach for the determination and correlation of diversity and efficiency of software development teams	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF SCIENCE												We examined the impact of diversity on team efficiency. To do so, a model was developed to measure both the efficiency and diversity of the teams. Based on these measures, the correlation between efficiency and diversity was also analysed. In addition, to demonstrate the applicability of the model, it was applied to a real-life problem involving five teams dealing with different software development projects. Firstly, diversity indices were calculated based on age, experience, education and gender information on each member for each team by using Simpson's Diversity Index. Then, four key performance indicators (KPIs) were defined to measure the success rate of the teams. Depending on these KPIs, efficiencies of the teams were measured through data envelopment analysis (DEA). The correlation between team efficiency and each diversity factor was analysed and all four factors had positive correlation with efficiency. That is, in order to increase efficiency, teams should be composed of members with diverse characteristics. Education was the diversity factor that had the most positive correlation with team efficiency. This result highlights the importance of different educational backgrounds on team efficiency. Significance: This study represents the first attempt to measure team diversity using Simpson's Diversity Index. A new technique is proposed to measure team efficiency through DEA. Team efficiency is positively correlated with diversity, specifically educational level, which is important for many software development teams to consider.																			0038-2353	1996-7489				MAR-APR	2018	114	3-4							2017-0331	10.17159/sajs.2018/20170331	http://dx.doi.org/10.17159/sajs.2018/20170331													WOS:000428433400015

We tested whether S. agalactiae PFGE types correspond to a specific serotype within individuals, and different individuals from the same geographic area. A total of 872 S. agalactiae isolates from 152 healthy individuals were classified by PFGE and capsular serotype. Serotype V was the most homogeneous (Simpson's diversity index 0-54); and types III, II and Ib were mostly heterogeneous (Simpson's diversity index >= 0.90). Within an individual, isolates with the same PFGE patterns had identical capsular types, but across individuals the same PFGE types sometimes occurred in different serotypes. Capsular type alone is insufficient to define epidemiological relatedness. Although PFGE types appear to be a valid surrogate for capsular typing of isolates from the same individual, it is not a valid surrogate for serotype in isolates from different individuals.

Soil samples were collected at a depth of 0 to 0.2 m during the dry season of 2009 in four areas of ultisol, which were visually defined as: REC - an area under recovery by erosion contention and the planting of exotic grasses and legumes; DEG- an area with high degradation; IDEG - an area with moderate degradation; MN - an area of native vegetation. The following were analysed: root colonization, the most probable number of infective propagules (MPN), diversity indices (the Shannon-Wiener index, the Simpson diversity and dominance indices, the Pielou equitability index and the Margalef index) and the soil chemical attributes of pH, H+Al, phosphorus and organic matter, used as explanatory variables for the variability of the AMF attributes by multivariate analyses. Root colonization and propagule MPN were higher in the REC area. The Shannon-Wiener index, the Simpson dominance index and the Margalef index were lower in the DEG area, showing that they are good indicators of changes in the AMF community in degraded areas. By hierarchical cluster analysis, the DEG area showed higher dissimilarity in relation to the other areas. By principal component analysis, the Shannon-Wiener index, the Margalef index and the Simpson dominance index, and the phosphorus levels were the parameters that best explained the total variation.					da Silva, Gladstone Alves/E-5110-2013; Araujo, Ademir/N-1377-2016	da Silva, Gladstone Alves/0000-0002-5652-7800; Araujo, Ademir/0000-0002-3212-3852													0045-6888	1806-6690				OCT-DEC	2012	43	4					648	657		10.1590/S1806-66902012000400005	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/S1806-66902012000400005													WOS:000309315700005
J	Negiz, MG; Ozkan, K				Negiz, Mehmet Guvenc; Ozkan, Kursad			REPRODUCING A COMPONENT DIVERSITY INDEX FOR REGIONAL BIODIVERSITY ASSESSMENTS	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												The fact that there is no any rule in selection of a given diversity index concerning the measures of biodiversity means that utilization only one of these to define the diversity of living communities is insufficient. Different diversity indices have been used by many researchers. Even though diversity indices have different facets, they are also highly correlative with each other. That allows us to reproduce a component diversity index from the all diversity indices we have used. The present study was carried out to get a component diversity index for the Kuyucak mountain of the Mediterranean region, Turkey. In the study, the woody vegetation data obtained from 800 sample plots were used. The diversity indices (Species richness (S) Shannon entropy (H), Simpson 1-dominance (1-lambda), Brillouin index (HB), reciprocal of Berker-Parker index (1/d), Menhinick (DMN) index, Margalef (DMG) index and Fisher' alpha (alpha F) were measured at each sample plot. The results of Pearson correlation analysis among the diversity indices showed that all indices are significantly correlated with each other at the level of 0.01. H has the strongest correlations with majority of the diversity indices whereas 1/d has generally weaker correlations with the indices compared to the other indices' inter-correlations.

RICE WEED COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AND RICHNESS IN NORTHERN IRAN: A TEMPERATE RAINY AREA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Knowledge about weed density and composition plays an important role in weed management decision making. Surveys were carried out to study the weed flora composition in rice fields of Guilan Province in Iran. 481 fields from 16 regions were selected for survey. Weed samples were taken with a W-shaped sampling pattern. Weed species were identified and the plant density, percentage frequency, uniformity, and abundance indices were determined. Biodiversity was calculated using Shannon-Weiner (H') and Simpson (D) diversity indices. A total of 66 species, belonging to 43 genera and 29 families were identified. The highest number of weeds belonged to the two families Cyperaceae and Poaceae with 15 and 8 species, respectively. The most frequent weed species were Echinochloa crus-galli (89.8%), and Paspalum distichum (79.4%), Echinochloa oryzoides (60.3%), Cyperus difformis (56.5%), Ecliptal prostrate (49.5%), Cyperus serotinus (34.7%), Azolla filiculoides (34.5%), Sagittaria trifolia (31.6%), Cyperus esculentus (31.6%) and Alisma plantago-aquatica (28.7%). Relative abundance index indicated that the annual weed species were more dominant than the perennial ones. Based on Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's diversity indices Talesh area had the highest weed diversity (H' = 2.85; D = 0.916) and Rudbar showed the lowest diversity values (H' = 1.97; D = 0.749).

J	Casquilho, JP				Casquilho, Jose Pinto			On the weighted Gini-Simpson index: estimating feasible weights using the optimal point and discussing a link with possibility theory	SOFT COMPUTING												Following a brief historic note on the foundations and some applications of the Gini-Simpson index and its weighted versions, it focuses on the inversion problem relative to the maximum point of the weighted index, which has the nature of a probability distribution given a set of positive weights. Then, after revisiting the general background of the topic under study is formulated the process of estimating feasible weights that would generate the maximizer's solution. The methodology herein explained uses a fixed-pole method, what provides a unique solution restricted to the support of the maximizer under a normalization constraint. The procedure is exemplified numerically, and an appellative link with possibility theory is discussed. The novel probability-possibility transformation here outlined, anchored in the optimal point of the weighted Gini-Simpson index and an associated consistency sufficient condition, seems to be plausible and even useful in given contexts, either as a basis for decision-making procedures or for testing real weights operating as driving forces of the composition. Also, the method provides a distinction between virtual and epistemic possibilities, relative to a defined quantitative threshold.

EFFECTS OF SOIL SALT CONCENTRATION ON<i> nirS</i> AND<i> nosZ</i> GENES DIVERSITY OF PADDY SOIL DENITRIFYING BACTERIA	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												To further study saline-alkali soil cultivation, the terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) was used to analyze the effects of different salt concentrations on the denitrification functional genes nirS and nosZ after collecting different soil samples and extracting total soil DNA. The results showed that the variation range of nirS gene abundance was concentrated in 14 segments, the nosZ gene abundance was concentrated in 9 segments. The abundance of nirS gene in paddy soil of different concentrations was higher than nosZ, and the activity of the nirS gene was higher. Diversity index analysis showed that sample I was significantly different from III and V in the Shannon index of the nirS. Sample I and IV were significantly different from III in Simpson index. Except for the significant difference between III and I, II, IV, and V, there was no difference between the other four samples significant in Pielou index. The difference between sampl I and V was extremely significant in Brillouin index. The Shannon index, Simpson index and Pielou index of nosZ gene were not significantly different, sample II and III, IV, V were significantly different in Brillouin index. The diversity of nirS gene was more affected by the salt concentration, and the nirS gene was more widely distributed than nosZ in soil with different salt concentrations. It indicated that nirS-mediated nitrite reductase played an important role in salinity affected soil environment.																			1018-7081	2309-8694				APR	2023	33	2					270	+		10.36899/JAPS.2023.2.0618	http://dx.doi.org/10.36899/JAPS.2023.2.0618													WOS:000958328000003
J	Payne, LX; Schindler, DE; Parrish, JK; Temple, SA				Payne, LX; Schindler, DE; Parrish, JK; Temple, SA			Quantifying spatial pattern with evenness indices	ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS												Quantifying the spatial distributions of organisms in simple and meaningful ways is important for understanding the ecology and habitat needs of species subject to anthropogenic disturbances. Most multi-species conservation and management programs do not yet account for the variation of space-use patterns exhibited by species preferring the same habitat type. To measure species' space-use patterns as a step toward determining habitat needs, we suggest using evenness indices. Although commonly used in characterizing communities (i.e., as a measure of species diversity), these indices are suitable for characterizing many other ecological patterns, including patterns of site use by individuals. We investigate the statistical properties of five indices (Camargo's index of evenness, E'; Simpson's index of evenness, E-1/D; Lloyd's index of mean crowding, J; Smith-Wilson index E-var; and Dispersion index, D-L, a variant of the Shannon diversity index) to evaluate their utility for quantifying broad-scale spatial patterns of migratory shorebirds. We use a Monte Carlo simulation approach to compare these indices for their (1) ability to characterize a wide range of spatial patterns (from even to patchy); (2) ability to discriminate among distributions; and (3) robustness to incomplete sampling. In addition, we compare the ability of these indices to characterize spatial dispersion for four species of shorebirds migrating through the United States: Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), Semipalmated Plover (C. semipalmatus), Sanderling (Calidris alba), and Red Knot (C. canutus). Overall, we recommend Camargo, Simpson, and Lloyd indices for quantifying spatial dispersion. All three indices gave precise and unbiased estimates once 35 or more sites (3.5% of 1000 simulated sites) were sampled randomly, regardless of the degree of patchiness. Nonrandom sampling resulted in biased estimates until a much greater proportion of sites (at least 30-50%) were sampled, highlighting the importance of site selection in sampling programs. Our analysis of shorebird spatial patterns revealed that evenness indices discriminate well among the species we considered, ranking Killdeer as most dispersed and Red Knot as most aggregated. Our results agree with earlier (independent) assessments of these species' migration strategies and illustrate how simple univariate metrics may be useful tools for characterizing complex spatial patterns.																			1051-0761	1939-5582				APR	2005	15	2					507	520		10.1890/03-5029	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/03-5029													WOS:000228059000009

Characterization of bird, reptile, and insect community diversity in constructed wetlands and waste stabilization ponds across Tanzania	ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING												Wastewater treatment systems, such as Constructed Wetlands (CWs) and Waste Stabilization Ponds (WSPs), have untapped biodiversity enhancement and development potential. Birds, insects, and reptiles, which are displaced by human development, might find refuge in these ecosystems. However, the lack of a detailed characterization of the biodiversity status of these wastewater treatment systems hinders their widespread adoption. Point counts, direct observations, and camera traps were used to assess bird diversity across five CWs and three WSPs in Tanzania in 2021. For insects and reptiles, pitfall and pan traps were laid along established transects, in addition, direct observations and fishnets were also used to assess the reptiles dwelling within the WSPs. Abundance, Shannon index, Simpson index, Margalef index, and evenness index were the diversity parameters used to analyze the diversity of birds, insects, and reptiles. Our results show that among the studied groups and between WSPs and CWs, birds had high species abundance (n = 1132), richness, Margalef index (D = 4.266), evenness (E = 0.815), Shannon diversity (H = 2.881) and Simpson index (lambda =0.903). The abundance and diversity of studied groups differed significantly (P < 0.05) between WSPs and CWs. Our study also recorded four reptile species belonging to three orders. Molecular analyses confirmed that insect species belong to nine orders and 13 families, with the order Diptera dominating both CWs and WSPs, followed by Orthoptera, Hymenoptera, and Araneae. We conclude that CW and WSP wastewater treatment systems are important for hosting various populations of birds, reptiles, and insect species.																			0925-8574	1872-6992				2023 NOV	2023	196								107082	10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107082	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoleng.2023.107082		SEP 2023											WOS:001080888000001

Plant microorganisms play an important role in the pathogenesis of nematodes. The phyllosphere and rhizosphere bacterial and fungal communities associated with healthy Pinus koraiensis (PKa) and P. koraiensis infected by B. xylophilus at the early (PKb) and last (PKc) stages were analyzed. Our results demonstrated that pine wood nematode (PWD) could increase the phyllosphere bacterial Pielou_e, Shannon, and Simpson index; phyllosphere fungal Chao 1 index, as well as rhizosphere bacterial Pielou_e, Shannon, and Simpson index; and rhizosphere fungal Pielou_e, Shannon, and Simpson index. What's more, slight shifts of the microbial diversity were observed at the early stage of infection, and the microbial diversity increased significantly as the symptoms of infection worsened. With the infection of B. xylophilus in P. koraiensis, Bradyrhizobium (rhizosphere bacteria), Massilia (phyllosphere bacteria), and Phaeosphaeriaceae (phyllosphere fungi) were the major contributors to the differences in community compositions among different treatments. With the infection of PWD, most of the bacterial groups tended to be co-excluding rather than co-occurring. These changes would correlate with microbial ability to suppress plant pathogen, enhancing the understanding of disease development and providing guidelines to pave the way for its possible management.						wenxu, zhu/0000-0002-7367-3754													0095-3628	1432-184X				2022 JUL	2022	84	1					285	301		10.1007/s00248-021-01850-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-021-01850-4		SEP 2021						34487211					WOS:000693124400002

We also explored how the functional evenness of life-history traits varies across biogeographical regions. Location Continental Americas. Methods We performed a trait classification based on an Eltonian approach and calculated functional diversity using Hill numbers, Shannon and Gini-Simpson indices. We tested the relationship between functional diversity and different axes of environmental variation by using a series of spatial autoregressive (SAR) models. Results Based on 212 different functional attributes for 2,776 species, we found that functional diversity has a latitudinal gradient consistent with that of species richness, regardless of the diversity index used. Evenness of functional diversity of amphibian assemblages varies depending on the region, but in general they are close to the maximum possible value. Areas with more functional richness relative to species richness are associated with high annual precipitation and low precipitation seasonality regardless of temperature; in contrast, areas with fewer functions than expected are associated with high aridity. Main conclusions The highest functional diversity is located in mountainous regions. Overall, functional diversity is positively correlated with humid environments with low precipitation seasonality and low aridity regardless of temperature. This is especially relevant for amphibians facing contemporary climate change because it suggests that future variation in rainfall patterns, but not in annual mean temperature, might interact with functional diversity to pose an imminent threat to amphibian functional diversity.

A Test of Foraging Models Using Dietary Diversity Indices for the Lomako Forest Bonobos	FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA												Optimal diet and functional response models are used to understand the evolution of primate foraging strategies. The predictions of these models can be tested by examining the geographic and seasonal variation in dietary diversity. Dietary diversity is a useful tool that allows dietary comparisons across differing sampling locations and time periods. Bonobos (Pan paniscus) are considered primarily frugivorous and consume fruits, leaves, insects, vertebrates, terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, and flowers. Frugivores, like bonobos, are valuable for examining dietary diversity and testing foraging models because they eat a variety of species and are subject to seasonal shifts in fruit availability. Frugivorous primate species thus allow for tests of how variation in dietary diversity is correlated with variation in ecological factors. We investigated measures of dietary diversity in bonobos at two research camps across field seasons within the same protected area (N'dele and Iyema) in Lomako Forest, Democratic Republic of the Congo. We compared the results of behavioral observation (1984/1985, 1991, 1995, 2014, and 2017) and fecal washing analysis (2007 and 2009) between seasons and study period using three diversity indices (Shannon's, Simpson's, and SW evenness). The average yearly dietary diversity indices at N'dele were Shannon's HMODIFIER LETTER PRIME = 2.04, Simpson's D = 0.82, and SW evenness = 0.88 while at Iyema, the indices were Shannon's HMODIFIER LETTER PRIME = 2.02, Simpson's D = 0.82, and SW evenness = 0.88. Behavioral observation data sets yielded significantly higher dietary diversity indices than fecal washing data sets. We found that food item (fruit, leaf, and flower) consumption was not associated with seasonal food availability for the 2017 behavioral observation data set. Shannon's index was lower during periods when fewer bonobo dietary items were available to consume and higher when fruit was abundant. Finally, we found that optimal diet models best-explained patterns of seasonal food availability and dietary diversity. Dietary diversity is an essential factor to consider when understanding primate diets and can be a tool in understanding variation in primate diets, particularly among frugivores. Dietary diversity varies across populations of the same species and across time, and it is critical in establishing a complete understanding of how primate diets change over time.																			0015-5713	1421-9980				NOV	2021	92	4					211	226		10.1159/000519722	http://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000519722								34727553					WOS:000728110200004
J	Michie, J; Oughton, C				Michie, Jonathan; Oughton, Christine			Measuring corporate diversity in financial services: a diversity index	INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF APPLIED ECONOMICS												This paper provides a measure of corporate diversity in financial services. Our index is based on four components: ownership; competitiveness; balance sheet structure/resilience; and geographic spread. The first of these sub-indexes measures ownership diversity based on the Berry index of diversification and the Gini-Simpson index of biodiversity. It captures the extent of diversity in ownership types - for the UK, banks, mutuals, and the government owned National Savings & Investment - where each of these have different objectives, creating diversity in behaviour. Our second sub-index captures the extent of competition, and is based on the inverse of the Hirschmann-Herfindahl index of concentration. Our third subindex measures diversity in balance sheet structures and resilience across the financial sector. Our final sub-index captures the extent of geographic spread and the regional concentration of financial services. These indicators are combined into a single index - the D-Index - that measures diversity in financial services. The D-Index shows a marked decline in the run-up to the 2007-2009 financial crisis, followed by further falls during 2008 and 2009. Since then, the index has remained more or less flat. We are no closer to creating the conditions - of diversity - to avoid a repeat of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis.

Samples were taken in autumn from the forest ground of the study sites (litter and soil till 7 cm in depth) during the three years of the study. Collected adult specimens were identified at species level and data were used to calculate the following indices: Shannon, Simpson, Eveness and Maturity index. On the whole, in the 8 study sites were recorded 63 species of Gamasida, belonging to 17 families, and some species seems to be a rare component of the fauna. Among study sites, diversity indices ranged from 2.20 to 2.57 for the Shannon index and from 0.82 to 0.90 for the Simpson, while the Maturity index ranged from 0.69 to 0.85; no substantial differences were observed among different study areas.

There is a lack of studies at a continental scale analyzing the relationship between urban green areas, such as parks and cemeteries, and bird species richness in the Neotropical region. Bird diversity-environment relationships in urban parks and cemeteries may be influenced by latitudinal gradients or species-area relationships. However, the seasonal variation of species diversity- environment has not been analyzed at a continental scale in the Neotropics. Methods: Bird surveys were conducted in 36 cemeteries and 37 parks within 18 Neotropical cities during non-breeding and breeding seasons. Bird diversity was assessed through Hill numbers, focusing on species richness, the effective number of species derived from Shannon index and the Simpson index. Environmental variables included latitude, altitude, and local scale variables such as area size, habitat diversity and pedestrian traffic. Results: Species richness and Shannon diversity were higher during the breeding season, whereas Simpson diversity did not vary between seasons. During both seasons, species richness increased with area size, was negatively related to altitude, and was the highest at 20 degrees latitude. Species richness was also positively related to habitat diversity, pedestrian traffic, and was highest in suburban areas during the non-breeding season. Shannon and Simpson diversity showed significant relationships with habitat diversity and area size during the breeding season. Bird diversity was similar between parks and cemeteries. Discussion: Our results showed that urban parks and cemeteries have similar roles in conserving urban bird diversity in Neotropical cities. However, species diversityenvironment relations at the continental scale varied between seasons, highlighting the importance of conducting annual studies.

We tested the utility of a novel richness-weighted abundance (RWA) index as a tool for guiding habitat conservation and restoration for native fishes and compared its utility to established indices of abundance and diversity (i.e., Shannon diversity index, Simpson diversity index, species richness, total catch). Habitat and fishes were sampled in the upper Niagara River during late summer, 2013-2015. We used multivariate adaptive regression splines to model the relation between each index of abundance or diversity of native age-0 fish and aquatic habitat fea-tures, and compared R-2 values among models to determine the strength of the relationship between each index and aquatic habitat features. Our RWA index had the strongest relation with habitat features (R-2 = 0.40) and Shannon and Simpson indices were unrelated to habitat features. We found the best habitats for native fishes (i.e., highest RWA scores) contained substantial submerged aquatic vegetation extending into the water column (20%), low water velocities (< 0.1 m/s), and fine to very fine substrates. Our approach of valuing habitat based on an RWA index allows researchers and practitioners to assess the quality of native fish assemblages and determine which habitat characteristics are associated with supporting those assemblages. This index should be applicable to other ecosystems, and has value for ranking existing sites for conservation and for setting clear goals for enhancement and restoration projects.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				OCT	2020	117								106713	10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106713	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106713													WOS:000555565500007

Fish samples were collected monthly between February to July 2018 at three landing stations: Choba: Station 1, Ogbogoro: Station 2 and Iwofe: Station 3. A total of 578 individuals belonging to three species (Sicklefin mullet (Neochelon falcipinnis Valenciennes, 1836), Largescaled mullet (Parachelon grandisquamis Valenciennes, 1836) and Flathead grey mullet (Mugil cephalus Linnaeus, 1758) of the family Mugilidae were sampled. N.falcipinus recorded the highest abundance (47.40%) followed by M.cephalus (36.85%) while P.grandisquamis recorded the least abundant (15.74%). The Simpson's index of diversity had the highest value of 0.63 in Choba station and the least value of 0.59 in Iwofe station, while the Simpson's reciprocal index highest value of 1.71 in Iwofe station and least value of 1.60 in Choba station. The Shannon- Weiner index and Pielou's eveness index value also recorded highest values of 1.03 and 0.94 in Choba station with the least values of 0.96 and 0.87 in Iwofe station respectively. The diversity indices showed that the family Mugilidae is fairly distributed in the study area and it is therefore recommended that further research should be carried out to provide a complete examination of the biology and ecology of the mullets within the New Calabar River.

THE LONG-TERM DYNAMICS OF ICHTHYOPLANKTON BIODIVERSITY IN THE OPEN PART OF THE SOUTHEASTERN BALTIC SEA	ZOOLOGICHESKY ZHURNAL												Based on long-term AtlantNIRO investigations and published data, the dynamics of Shannon's index of general diversity and Simpson's dominance index were studied in the ichthyoplankton of the open part of the southeastern Baltic Sea. Beginning from the late 1940s to 1990s, the index of general diversity exhibited a stable downward trend, whereas the dominance index permanently increased. It was caused by a drastic decline in the cod egg abundance and a significant growth of the sprat abundance. As result, a shift was observed from poly-dominance to monodominant ichthyoplankton assemblage. Mechanisms that compensate the low species saturation of the ichthyoplankton assemblage diversity are discussed.																			0044-5134					OCT	2009	88	10					1222	1229																WOS:000271968600010

A good measure gives precise, reliable, and efficient information about the community structure. This study was conducted to evaluate the statistical properties and test some alpha diversity indices' efficiency through a bootstrap resampling. The available birds' data were being applied in some alpha diversity indices. Moreover, the Shapiro-Wilk test is being used to test the normality of the index. All indices analyzed have p -values higher than the alpha level of significance (alpha=0.05), indicating that the index's bootstrap sampling distribution is normally distributed. Mostly, all indices are consistently efficient at large sample sizes. The Menhinick richness index is more efficient in measuring birds' species richness since it has the smallest means squared error (MSE) values. Among the diversity indices studied in this paper, Simpson's diversity index generated smaller mean squared error (MSE) values; thus, it is a more efficient diversity index in measuring birds' diversity. The Shannon evenness index is more efficient among the five evenness indices in measuring species evenness of birds because it provides the smaller MSE values.

However, the relationships were both complex and dependent on the racial group. Racial diversity was assessed for all 927 metropolitan and micropolitan areas as opposed to just the largest fifty or the largest one hundred. Racial segregation and isolation were assessed at the block group level (excluding water and zero population block groups), not the census tract level, within each metro/micro area. The eight non-overlapping racial groups as defined by the U.S. Census were used. Racial diversity was measured with the Diversity Index (the Simpson Index). Racial residential segregation was measured with the pairwise Dissimilarity Index (D) and the Multigroup Dissimilarity Index (D-G) as it was initially proposed using expected frequencies. Racial isolation was measured with the Isolation Index (P*).																				2413-8851				DEC	2022	6	4							66	10.3390/urbansci6040066	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/urbansci6040066													WOS:000902924800001
J	Jost, L				Jost, L			Entropy and diversity	OIKOS												Entropies such as the Shannon-Wiener and Gini-Simpson indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sorensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita-Horn index as special cases.

The study used multi stage sampling in combination with stratified and simple random sampling procedures to select kebeles and households. The Simpson Index of Diversity (SID) and Fractional response model were employed to analyse the data collected from a sample of 153 rural households. The level and type of income diversification depends on the accessibility and availability of different income sources. The mean results of degree of income diversification revealed that Simpson Index of Diversity (SID = 0.24) by rural households in the study area. Based on fractional response model educational status, credit utilization, distance from market and access to electric power affect at p < 0.01% probability level, sex of the household head affect at p < 0.05% probability level and, annual household income, special skill and household size significantly affecting degree of income diversification at p < 0.1% probability level. The finding of this research indicates important policy implications suggesting that programs, projects and/or any interventions designed targeting to engage people in other income-generating activities would augment their income sources, which are made to increase the level of income diversification at household level in Asayita woreda.

J	Kalyoncu, H; Zeybek, M				Kalyoncu, Hasan; Zeybek, Melek			An application of different biotic and diversity indices for assessing water quality: A case study in the Rivers Cukurca and Isparta (Turkey)	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH												A number of biotic indices (Biological Monitoring Working Party-BMWP, Average Score Per Taxa-ASPT, Belgian Biotic Index-BBI, Family Biotic Index-FBI, Saproby Index-SI, Extended Biotic Index-EBI, Biotic Index for Pampean Rivers and Streams-IBPAMP), diversity indices (Margalef-MDI, Simpson-SDI and Shannon and Weaver-SWDI Diversity indices) and EPT% (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera), EPT/Chironomus%, based on benthic macroinvertebrates in relation to physicochemical parameters, have been applied in assessing the water quality of the Rivers Cukurca and Isparta (Mediterranean Region, Turkey). According to the results, the water quality in both rivers varied from weak to excellent. From the indices, SWDI index of the diversity indices and BBI index of the biotic indices seem to be the most reliable. All indices, except EBI were found applicable for Mediterranean Region in Turkey. More researches must be carried out, to get exact decisions about the applicability of EBI in Turkey's rivers.																			1991-637X					JAN 4	2011	6	1					19	27																WOS:000287927200003

The congruences in water quality bioassessment based on diversity and biotic indices and using different taxonomic categories were also explored to find the best assessment method of water quality for the lake. All major structural characteristics of macrozoobenthic community, including species composition, abundance, biomass and four biomass-based diversity indices (Shannon's diversity, Simpson's diversity, Pielou's evenness and Simpson's evenness index) fluctuated significantly in season but in space. The above four abundance-based diversity indices plus abundance-based Margalef's richness index did not display significant spatial variations; and significant seasonal differences were found in three indices only. Water temperature was the key environmental factor responsible for macrozoobenthic spatio-temporal distribution patterns. Water quality assessed by Shannon's index (H-a') and biological pollution index (BPI) rather than the other four biotic indices were consistent with those by trophic state index (TSI). Results from chironomids and oligochaetes did not always agree to those from the whole community when H-a' or Hilsenhoff biotic index was applied to bioassessment. Therefore, combining multiple indices and avoiding a single taxonomic category to assess water quality are strongly recommended and in Mingzhu Lake using a mixture of H-a' and BPI will ensure the most effective investigation of water quality. Our results also show that the main structural characteristics of macrozoobenthic communities in the small lake may display consistent spatial patterns.					li, li/GPX-3938-2022; liu, xiao/HKE-9880-2023; wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023														0254-4059	1993-5005				SEP	2016	34	5					928	936		10.1007/s00343-016-4244-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00343-016-4244-9													WOS:000379737000005

Subtype diversity and reassortment potential for co-circulating avian influenza viruses at a diversity hot spot	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL ECOLOGY												Biological diversity has long been used to measure ecological health. While evidence exists from many ecosystems that declines in host biodiversity may lead to greater risk of disease emergence, the role of pathogen diversity in the emergence process remains poorly understood. Particularly, because a more diverse pool of pathogen types provides more ways in which evolutionary innovations may arise, we suggest that host-pathogen systems with high pathogen diversity are more prone to disease emergence than systems with relatively homogeneous pathogen communities. We call this prediction the diversity-emergence hypothesis. To show how this hypothesis could be tested, we studied a system comprised of North American shorebirds and their associated low-pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) viruses. These viruses are important as a potential source of genetic innovations in influenza. A theoretical contribution of this study is an expression predicting the rate of viral subtype reassortment to be proportional to both prevalence and Simpson's Index, a formula that has been used traditionally to quantify biodiversity. We then estimated prevalence and subtype diversity in host species at Delaware Bay, a North American AIV hotspot, and used our model to extrapolate from these data. We estimated that 4 to 39 virus subtypes circulated at Delaware Bay each year between 2000 and 2008, and that surveillance coverage (percentage of co-circulating subtypes collected) at Delaware Bay is only about 63 center dot 0%. Simpson's Index in the same period varied more than fourfold from 0 center dot 22 to 0 center dot 93. These measurements together with the model provide an indirect, model-based estimate of the reassortment rate. A proper test of the diversity-emergence hypothesis would require these results to be joined to independent and reliable estimates of reassortment, perhaps obtained through molecular surveillance. These results suggest both that subtype diversity (and therefore reassortment) varies from year to year and that several subtypes contributing to reassortment are going undetected. The similarity between these results and more detailed studies of one host, ruddy turnstone (Arenaria interpres), further suggests that this species may be the primary host for influenza reassortment at Delaware Bay. Biological diversity has long been quantified using Simpson's Index. Our model links this formula to a mechanistic account of reassortment in multipathogen systems in the form of subtype diversity at Delaware Bay, USA. As a theory of how pathogen diversity may influence the evolution of novel pathogens, this work is a contribution to the larger project of understanding the connections between biodiversity and disease.

AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT												Arthropods are important components of the soil fauna in improving soil quality and its structural properties. Arthropods are also very sensitive to soil management practices. Thus, a study was carried out in a vineyard in the Douro Demarcated Region (Northeast Portugal), to investigate the effect of three soil management practices (tillage, ground cover with spontaneous vegetation, and ground cover with sown vegetation) on the activity density, richness and diversity of soil arthropods, as well as on the stability of their communities. Soil-surface arthropods were assessed in 2014 and 2015 using pitfall traps, while soil-living arthropods were assessed in 2016 by collecting soil samples and extracting them through a Berlese-Tullgren funnel. The possibility of using the Soil Biological Quality index (QBS-ar index) as a tool to discriminate soils of vines subject to those management practices was also investigated. Results show that ground cover treatments significantly enhanced the activity density of soil-surface herbivores and of their potential natural enemies in both years and the activity density of detritivores in 2014. The richness of total soil-surface arthropods and potential predators was also increased by ground cover treatments in 2015. In both years, Simpson's diversity index of herbivores was enhanced by ground cover treatments, and in 2015, Simpson's diversity index of the total soil-surface arthropods, potential predators, and omnivores was significantly higher in spontaneous vegetation than in tillage or sown vegetation treatments. The soil-surface arthropods community stability was positively affected by both their activity density and richness in 2015, with that stability being better achieved in the sown vegetation treatment. In soil-living arthropods, activity density, richness and Simpson's diversity index were significantly higher in ground cover treatments than in the tillage treatment. The QBS-ar index was significantly higher in ground cover treatments than in the tillage, suggesting that this index can be a useful tool to discriminate soil management practices in vineyards. In conclusion, our results indicate that the ground cover with vegetation improves the activity density and diversity of soil arthropods in vineyards.

J	Lisek, J				Lisek, Jerzy			Diversity of Summer Weed Communities in Response to Different Plum Orchard Floor Management in-Row	AGRONOMY-BASEL												The effect of five methods of in-row weed management on the species composition and diversity of summer weed communities in a plum orchard was evaluated. Different methods of orchard floor management (OFM) were implemented for seven consecutive years from 2009 to 2015. Festuca rubra L. ssp. rubra-rhizomatous perennial grass was sown as a cover crop in the alleys of the orchard, in the tree planting year. In the seventh year of OFM implementation, the treatments were ranked according to the decreasing value of the Shannon-Wiener floristic diversity index as follows: tillage, post-emergence herbicides spraying, mowing, mulch, and weedy control. The highest value of Simpson dominance index was found in the control treatment. In plots with such treatments as control, mowing, tillage, and mulch, the dominant species was F. rubra. This meant that the rhizomatous cover crop from the alleys penetrated and affected the in-row flora. Vegetation of mulched plots was characterized by low value of density and soil cover. The obtained results indicated that the flora developing in the control, sprayed with post-emergence herbicides, tilled and mowed plots had greater potential to provide ecosystem services, than the flora of mulched plots.																				2073-4395				MAY 21	2023	13	5							1421	10.3390/agronomy13051421	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/agronomy13051421													WOS:000994171900001
J	Keszthelyi, S				Keszthelyi, Sandor			Diversity and seasonal patterns of longhorn beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in the Zselic region, Hungary	NORTH-WESTERN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												This study aims to assess the abundance and diversity of Cerarabycid.beetles (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) in different types of habitats (urbanized, natural oak forest, herbaceous and mixed forest) of the Zselic region in Hungary. Beetles were collected by sweep netting and hand collecting. Species richness and diversity were analyzed for the different habitats. Temporal data also contributed to a better knowledge of the flight period and ecology of the captured species and specimens. A total of 69 species were identified during the sampling period (2009-2013). The period of adult flight activity was from the second week of May until the second week of June. Plagionotus arcuatus L., Dorcadion aethiops Scopoli and Strangalia melanura Fabricius were the most abundant species. The most diverse habitat type was mixed forest (Simpson Index= 0.9443; Shannon Index= 1.4373), and the least diverse one was the urbanized environment (Simpson Index= 0.4141; Shannon Index= 0.5111). The differences in diversity might be explained by the heterogeneity of potential host plants available in the different habitats. Correspondence and cluster analyses revealed that different habitats were associated with distinct beetle assemblages. Certain Cerambycidae species are associated with certain habitats, although some species might be present in several types of habitats due to their lower plant specificity.

Here, using meta-analysis, we synthesized 997 paired observations extracted from 94 peer-reviewed publications to assess how drought affects the biomass, density, taxonomic richness, and diversity (Shannon-Wiener, Simpson, and Pielou indices) of instream invertebrates at a global scale. We found that (i) drought significantly decreased instream invertebrate density and taxonomic richness by an average of 4.9 and 5.0%, respectively, had marginal negative effects on Shannon-Wiener index, but did not affect biomass, Simpson index or Pielou index; (ii) the effects of drought on instream invertebrate biomass, density, and diversity were not affected by taxonomic level, indicating the robustness of our results; and (iii) stream water physiochemical characteristics such as water flow velocity, pH, conductivity, discharge, total nitrogen concentration, and chlorophyll-a concentration were important moderator variables of drought effects on instream invertebrate communities. Overall, our results clearly showed the global patterns and driving factors of drought effects on instream invertebrate biomass, density, richness, and diversity, which helps scientists better understand the responses of instream invertebrate communities under ongoing global climate change.

In this study we estimated the diversity components (alpha, beta and gamma) of the spider community at El Vinculo Natural Regional Park, using the additive partitioning of diversity (species richness, Shannon's diversity index and Simpson's index) for the first time on this taxon in Colombia. We collected the specimens following a nested sampling design that consisted of two spatial scales. At the local scale, we quantified additive diversity components in 238 sampling units, and at the regional scale in five vegetation types. Total observed regional diversity (gamma) was partitioned into its additive components: within sampling units (alpha(1)), among sampling units (beta(1)) and among vegetation types (beta(2)). We used the same approach to compare common and infrequent spider species and to compare sampling methods. A total of 1565 adult spiders and 72 identifiable juveniles, including 193 morphospecies from 36 families, was sampled during the study. In all cases (entire community, infrequent species, common species and four different sampling methods) we found that a significant percentage, relative to that of randomization tests, of the diversity measurements used was attributed to beta diversity among vegetation types. The relative contributions of alpha and beta diversity to total observed regional diversity depended on the diversity measurement used. The contribution of beta diversity with respect to alpha diversity was low using Simpson's index (less than 20%), whereas with species richness and Shannon's index the contribution was high (up to 90% and up to 66%, respectively). Our results suggest that beta diversity is the main component of diversity in the natural park. We concluded that the maintenance of a large variety of vegetation types can be an important tool for the conservation of spider richness at the natural park.

In forest communities, there are large variations in tree size among species and individuals of the same species, which result in differences in ecological processes and ecosystem functions. However, tree size inequality (TSI) has been largely neglected in studies using the available diversity indices. The TSI in the diameter at breast height (DBH) data for each of 999 20 m x 20 m forest census quadrats was quantified using the Gini index (GI), a measure of the inequality of size distribution. The generalized performance equation was used to describe the rotated and right-shifted Lorenz curve of the cumulative proportion of DBH and the cumulative proportion of number of trees per quadrat. We also examined the relationships of alpha-diversity indices with the GI using correlation tests. The generalized performance equation effectively described the rotated and right-shifted Lorenz curve of DBH distributions, with most root-mean-square errors (990 out of 999 quadrats) being < 0.0030. There were significant positive correlations between each of three alpha-diversity indices (i.e., R, D, and H') and the GI. Nevertheless, the total abundance of trees in each quadrat did not significantly influence the GI. This means that the TSI increased with increasing species diversity. Thus, two new indices are proposed that can balance alpha-diversity against the extent of TSI in the community: (1 - GI) x D, and (1 - GI) x H'. These new indices were significantly correlated with the original D and HGREEK TONOS, and did not increase the extent of variation within each group of indices. This study presents a useful tool for quantifying both species diversity and the variation in tree sizes in forest communities, especially in the face of cumulative species loss under global climate change.

The basin is composed of mixed but primarily agricultural land uses. From March 2004 to November 2007, a total of 2,004 surface water samples were collected from 24 sampling sites. E. coli densities ranged from undetectable to 1.64 x 10(5) CFU 100 ml(-1) and were correlated with stream order and proximity to livestock production systems. The diversity of 21,307 E. coli isolates was characterized using repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR (rep-PCR), allowing for the identification of as many as 7,325 distinct genotypes, without capturing all of the diversity. The community was temporally and spatially dominated by a few dominant genotypes (clusters of more than 500 isolates) and several genotypes of intermediary abundance (clustering between 10 and 499 isolates). Simpson diversity indices, assessed on a normalized number of isolates per sample, ranged from 0.050 to 0.668. Simpson indices could be statistically discriminated on the basis of year and stream order, but land use, discharge, weather, and water physical-chemical properties were not statistically important discriminators. The detection of Campylobacter species was associated with statistically lower Simpson indices (greater diversity; P < 0.05). Waterborne E. coli isolates from genotypes of dominant and intermediary abundance were clustered with isolates obtained from fecal samples collected in the study area over the same period, and 90% of the isolates tested proved to share genotypes with fecal isolates. Overall, our data indicated that the densities and distribution of E. coli in these mixed-use watersheds were linked to stream order and livestock-based land uses. Waterborne E. coli populations that were distinct from fecal isolates were detected and, on this basis, were possibly naturalized E. coli strains.

There was no reduction on seedbank, although lower number of species and families and diversity index ( Shannon and Simpson) with burning were observed. There was also greater importance value index ( IVI) and number of native species, in the non burned area, and of weeds in the burned one. It was observed that the crop area had higher seed density than the pasture and cerrado areas. The species with the highest IVI in the areas were those considered as weeds and forages. The crop area presented lower IVI of native species than the pasture and cerrado areas; besides, it presented diversity indexes ( Shannon and Simpson) and native species percentage lower than pasture and cerrado. The cultivation with crop cause higher disturbance in the areas than burning.

Timely and accurate monitoring and evaluation of large-area wall-to-wall maps on plant diversity and its spatial heterogeneity are crucial for the conservation and management of forest resources. However, traditional botanical field surveys designed to estimate plant diversity are usually limited in their spatiotemporal resolutions. Using Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) data at high spatiotemporal scales, combined with and referenced to botanical field surveys, may be the best choice to provide accurate plant diversity distribution information over a large area. In this paper, we predicted and mapped plant diversity in a subtropical forest using 24 months of freely and openly available S-1 and S-2 images (10 m x 10 m) data over a large study area (15,290 km(2)). A total of 448 quadrats (10 m x 10 m) of forestry field surveys were captured in a subtropical evergreen-deciduous broad-leaved mixed forest to validate a machine learning algorithm. The objective was to link the fine Sentinel spectral and radar data to several ground-truthing plant diversity indices in the forests. The results showed that: (1) The Simpson and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices were the best predicted indices using random forest regression, with (r) over cap (2) of around 0.65; (2) The use of S-1 radar data can enhance the accuracy of the predicted heterogeneity indices in the forests by approximately 0.2; (3) As for the mapping of Simpson and Shannon-Wiener, the overall accuracy was 67.4% and 64.2% respectively, while the texture diversity's overall accuracy was merely 56.8%; (4) From the evaluation and prediction map information, the Simpson, Shannon-Wiener and texture diversity values (and its confidence interval values) indicate spatial heterogeneity in pixel level. The large-area forest plant diversity indices maps add spatially explicit information to the ground-truthing data. Based on the results, we conclude that using the time-series of S-1 and S-2 radar and spectral characteristics, when coupled with limited ground-truthing data, can provide reasonable assessments of plant spatial heterogeneity and diversity across wide areas. It could also help promote forest ecosystem and resource conservation activities in the forestry sector.

J	McQueen, JP; Treonis, AM				McQueen, J. Parr; Treonis, Amy M.			Cacao agroforestry in Belize: Effects on soil nematode community structure	AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS												Cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) is a shade tolerant crop that can be grown beneath the rainforest canopy rather than in a conventional monoculture. Cacao agroforestry has been proposed as a more sustainable method of farming to mitigate climate change and protect above-ground biodiversity, yet impacts on soil biodiversity and function have rarely been investigated. Our goal was to study how the diversity and community structure of soil nematodes are impacted by planting the rainforest understory with cacao. At field sites in southern Belize and during two growing seasons, nematodes were extracted from soil from cacao agroforestry plots, undisturbed rainforests, and a banana plantation. Nematodes were enumerated and visually identified, and communities were analyzed using several community and diversity indices. In both the dry and wet seasons, soils from cacao plots contained similar nematode communities to the rainforest with respect to all measured variables, including the abundance of nematodes from each trophic group, the Bongers Maturity and Plant-Parasite indices, and the Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices. In contrast, the banana plantation soils were dominated by plant-parasitic nematodes with lower Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices. Overall, it appears that cacao agroforestry plots maintain nematode community structure relative to the undisturbed rainforest they were created from, suggesting that soil health is not compromised by this land-use strategy.

J	Lu, HP; Wagner, HH; Chen, XY				Lu, Hui-Ping; Wagner, Helene H.; Chen, Xiao-Yong			A contribution diversity approach to evaluate species diversity	BASIC AND APPLIED ECOLOGY												Measuring species diversity is critical for ecological research and biodiversity conservation. The separate assessment of within-unit diversity and unit distinctiveness in the form of endemism may Lead to biased results when evaluating the importance of a unit for regional diversity. In this paper, we adopt the additive partitioning of species diversity and propose a series of measurements decomposing the contribution of a unit into two components, one based on within-unit species diversity and the other on unit distinctiveness, for species richness and Simpson's index. We also propose a differentiation coefficient to evaluate the distribution of species diversity within and among units and to compare the relative importance of unit distinctiveness and within-unit diversity for regional diversity. Using simulations and a real data set of tree species in a community consisting of nine plots, we compared the proposed method with other ranking methods. The definition of unit-specific additive components of species diversity facilitates diversity scaling in hierarchical systems. The individual components may be used to identify the factors determining the contribution of a unit to larger-scale diversity, while avoiding typical problems associated with the number of endemic species. The ranking of units based on an integrated assessment of alpha and beta diversity at the unit level provides an objective foundation for determining conservation priorities.

Therefore, sampling including some water quality parameters was conducted twice in the four seasons: autumn, summer, spring, and winter, from September 2020 to August 2021, in the first week of September, December, February, March, May, June, and August. Most of the physicochemical parameter values recorded in this study indicated that they were within the range of standards for zooplankton community requirements. Of the 14 species identified, Mesocyclops aequatorialis similis, Thermodiaptomus galebi, and Bra-chionus angularis had the first, second, and lowest records, respectively. Species abundance showed a decrease from autumn to winter and then to spring and summer. Species richness (14), abundance (6736), Margalef's diversity index (1.48), Menhinick's diversity index (0.17), Simpson index (0.098), dominance index (0.902), Shannon index (2.47), equality index (0.934), and reciprocal Simpson index (10.2) of the species were calculated in the reservoir. Some of the proposed management measures include reservoir buffering, impact assessment of over-abstraction of water for irrigation, time series of water quality data, and the reservoir water level should be above the conduit.

We compared Erosive Reflux Disease (ERD) to gastritis and Non-erosive Reflux Disease (NERD) subjects by 16S rRNA approach on gastric biopsy specimens. A total of 197 subjects were included consisting of gastritis (68; 34.52%), ERD (55; 27.92%), and NERD (74; 37.56%). After quality filtering, 187 samples were included for OTU analysis using Qiime2. Results We observed a significant difference in alpha diversity (Shannon and Simpson indexes were P = 0.0016 and P = 0.017, respectively). A significant decrease in alpha diversity index was observed in NERD with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori)-positive subjects than in gastritis (Simpson index P = 0.022; Shannon index P = 0.029), indicating a significant influence of H. pylori on the diversity in the stomach despite the diseases. In H. pylori-negative samples, alpha diversity measurement by the abundance coverage estimates (ACE) and Fisher Test revealed that ERD had significantly lower richness than gastritis and NERD groups (P = 0.00012 and P = 0.00043, respectively). Anaerobacillus sp. could only be found in ERD patients by LEFse analysis. Conclusions The presence of ERD could alter microbiome diversity. A negative correlation between H. pylori and ERD is shown in this microbiome study but not in NERD.

Evaluation of Changes in Native Vegetation Cover of Dust Sources in the Southwest of Iran under Different Irrigation Systems and Rainfall Patterns in Seedling Cultivation Areas	ARID ECOSYSTEMS												Efficient use of rainfall and water storage is fundamental to rehabilitating and improving rangelands in arid areas. In this study, we evaluated the changes in the native vegetation cover of three regions (dust centers) of the south and southeast of Ahvaz under different irrigation systems and rainfall patterns following seedling cultivation. A native of five 100-m transects, each 50 m apart, were systematically established in the three selected areas. Around 180 fixed plots were installed along transects. In the two growing seasons of spring and autumn from 2018 to 2020, the coverage of native species was recorded. The Simpson and Shannon and dominance diversity indices were estimated using the PAST software. The results showed that in the selected areas, various irrigation methods along with rainfall caused significant positive changes in vegetation cover, the number of species, and diversity from 2018 to 2020. The results indicated a significant difference between the average dominance index, Simpson and Shannon indices, and vegetation cover, as well as the number of species in different years. This study has identified that due to the lack of water for surface irrigation, contour furrowing and pitting using an excavator is the best and cost-effective way to restore native species. In addition to creating a suitable hole for receiving irrigation water, this method provides better drainage of the area during the rainy season, providing a suitable substrate for the growth and germination of seeds of native plants.

Results showed that individuals (clonal ramets) per genotype were 1.12 and 1.149 at population and species levels, respectively, and that the 16 populations were all multiclonal. The detected genotypes were localized, without exception, within populations but demonstrated relatively high clonal differentiation among populations. The clonal diversity of the studied populations was high, with the average Simpson's index of 0.975, while the genets showed a clonal architecture of "guerilla". The population genetic diversities revealed by genet were consistent with those by ramet, further confirming their genetic differentiation among populations. And its genotype diversity within populations probably resulted largely from the frequent seedling regeneration and self-compatibility. In addition, the correlation analysis further revealed that, among the ecological factors, Simpson's index of C. udensis had a significant positive correlation (P < 0.05) with pH values in the soil but not others.																			1006-9305					JUL	2008	51	7					575	582		10.1007/s11427-008-0087-8	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11427-008-0087-8								18622740					WOS:000257595000001
J	Archaux, F; Bergès, L; Chevalier, R				Archaux, Frederic; Berges, Laurent; Chevalier, Richard			Are plant censuses carried out on small quadrats more reliable than on larger ones?	PLANT ECOLOGY												Plant censuses are known to be significantly affected by observers' biases. In this study, we checked whether the magnitude of observer effects (defined as the % of total variance) varied with quadrat size: we expected the census repeatability (% of the total variance that is not due to measurement errors) to be higher for small quadrats than for larger ones. Variations according to quadrat size of the repeatability of species richness, Simpson equitability and reciprocal diversity indices, Ellenberg indicator values, plant cover and plant frequency were assessed using 359 censuses of vascular plants. These were carried out independently by four professional botanists during spring 2002 on the same 18 forest plots, each comprising one 400-m(2) quadrat, four 4-m(2) and four 2-m(2) quadrats. Time expenditure was controlled for. General Linear Models using random effects only were applied to the ecological indices to estimate variance components and magnitude of the following effects (if possible): plot, quadrat, observer, plant species and two-way interactions. High repeatability was obtained for species richness and Ellenberg indicator values. Species richness and Ellenberg indicator values were generally more accurate but also more biased in large quadrats. Simpson reciprocal diversity and equitability indices were poorly repeatable (especially equitability) probably because plant cover estimates varied widely among observers, irrespective of quadrat size. Grouping small quadrats usually increased the repeatability of the variable considered (e.g. species richness, Simpson diversity, plant cover) but the number of plant species found on those pooled 16 m(2) was much lower than if large plots were sampled. We therefore recommend to use large, single quadrats for forest vegetation monitoring.					; Archaux, Frederic/M-5242-2014	Berges, Laurent/0000-0003-0408-7900; Archaux, Frederic/0000-0002-9996-0006													1385-0237	1573-5052				FEB	2007	188	2					179	190		10.1007/s11258-006-9155-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11258-006-9155-y													WOS:000243399000005

Since gut microbiota dysbiosis is potentially modifiable, it has been postulated to be a promising preventive or therapeutic target for rheumatic diseases. However, the current understanding on the potential associations between gut microbiota and rheumatic diseases is still inadequate. Therefore, we aimed to synthesise the accumulating evidence for the relation of gut microbiota to rheumatic diseases. Methods The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to March 11, 2022 to include observational studies evaluating the associations between gut microbiota and rheumatic diseases. Standardised mean difference (SMD) of alpha-diversity indices between rheumatic diseases and controls were estimated using ran-dom-effects model. beta-diversity indices and relative abundance of gut microbes were summarised qualitatively. Findings Of the included 92 studies (11,998 participants), 68 provided data for a-diversity. Taken together as a whole, decreases in a-diversity indices were consistently found in rheumatic diseases (observed species: SMD = -0.36, [95%CI = -0.63, -0.09]; Chao1: SMD = -0.57, [95%CI = -0.88, -0.26]; Shannon index: SMD = -0.33, [95%CI = -0.48, -0.17]; Simpson index: SMD = -0.32, [95%CI = -0.49, -0.14]). However, when specific rheumatic diseases were examined, decreases were only observed in rheumatoid arthritis (observed species: SMD = -0.51, [95%CI = -0.78, -0.24]; Shannon index: SMD = -0.31, [95%CI = -0.49, -0.13]; Simpson index: SMD = -0.31, [95%CI = -0.54, -0.08]), systemic lupus erythematosus (Chao1: SMD = -1.60, [95%CI = -2.54, -0.66]; Shannon index: SMD = -0.63, [95%CI = -1.08, -0.18]), gout (Simpson index: SMD = -0.64, [95%CI = -1.07, -0.22]) and fibromyalgia (Simpson index: SMD = -0.28, [95%CI = -0.44, -0.11]), whereas an increase was observed in systemic sclerosis (Shannon index: SMD = 1.25, [95%CI = 0.09, 2.41]). Differences with sta-tistical significance in [3-diversity were consistently reported in ankylosing spondylitis and IgG4-related diseases. Although little evidence of disease specificity of gut microbes was found, shared alterations of the depletion of anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing microbe (i.e., Faecalibacterium) and the enrichment of pro-inflammatory microbe (i.e., Streptococcus) were observed in rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus. Interpretation Gut microbiota dysbiosis was associated with rheumatic diseases, principally with potentially non-specific, shared alterations of microbes.

J	Gergócs, V; Hufnagel, L				Gergocs, Veronika; Hufnagel, Levente			Global pattern of oribatid mites (Acari: Oribatida) revealed by fractions of beta diversity and multivariate analysis	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ACAROLOGY												Global patterns of organisms have long been investigated by calculating the (dis)similarity among geographical units followed by multivariate analysis. Beta-diversity-related structural characteristics of world-scale data, such as nestedness or species replacement may also be considered as an additional tool in revealing distributional patterns more accurately. To achieve this objective, our study combines cluster analysis and ordination based on Jaccard and Simpson dissimilarity with the decomposition of beta diversity into meaningful fractions. As a model group, the oribatid mite fauna of the seven biogeographic realms was analysed at three taxonomic levels, i.e. species, genus and family. The highest overall similarity was obtained between the Palaearctic and Nearctic realms and the lowest richness resulted for the Antarctic realm. The classifications and ordinations usually differed with the two dissimilarity indices. Beta diversity decomposition showed that these discrepancies were caused by different patterns of nestedness and taxon richness. Our study is the first to demonstrate that such a complex approach may disclose several features of biogeographic data not apparent otherwise and therefore may improve our understanding of inter-regional relationships.

The samples were collected from three partially separated stations of the Chashma Lake on a monthly basis. A total 42 species of zooplankton were identified from the Chashma Lake belonging to three taxa viz.; copepoda, rotifera and cladocera. The diversity of the zooplankton species in the lake was determined by richness and evenness indices, which were found as follows; Margalef Index 1.30 to 3.87, Shannon's Index 2.54 to 3.68, Simpson Index 0.92 to 0.97, Simpson's Reciprocal Index 12.25 to 37.69 and Pielou's Evenness Index 0.94 to 1.0. The zooplankton community was found abundant in summer as compared to winter. The copepods were found dominant followed by rotifers and cladocerans for entire study period. The spatial distribution of zooplankton was not found prominent as compared to their seasonal distribution. However, rotifers showed spatial difference among sampling stations (ANOVA, p-value < 0.05). The present study provides a first detailed spatial and seasonal distribution of zooplankton in Chashma Lake, which may be a road map for further studies on zooplankton diversity in other freshwater lakes in the region.

The objective of this study was to examine the influence of C3 and C4 plants on species diversity and productivity relationship in the grassland of Inner Mongolia. Above ground dry matter, species richness and diversity were measured in semi-arid grassland at 20 sites in Inner Mongolia during the summers of 2007, 2008 and 2012. In this study, a total of 60 quadrates were located and study sites were divided into three categories (sites dominated by C3 plants, sites with a mixture of C3 and C4 plants and sites dominated by C4 plants) on the basis of above ground dry matter ratio of C3 and C4 plants. Above ground dry matter was the highest in sites dominated by C4 plants. At sites dominated by C3 and at C3 and C4 mixed sites a significant positive linear relationship between above ground dry matter with both species richness index and Simpson's diversity index was recorded. However, in sites dominated by C4 plants, above ground dry matter is not significantly related to species richness and diversity. The results suggest that the sites dominated by C3 plants and the C3 and C4 mixed sites are important for diversity conservation in semi-arid grassland of Inner Mongolia.																			0552-9034	2076-0906				JUN	2015	52	2					259	264																WOS:000360824900001

Field data were collected in 18 altitudinal intervals of 100 m each. Polynomial regression was used to find relations of the different growth forms with elevation. The Shannon index was used for calculating alpha-diversity and the Simpson index for beta-diversity. Species richness and alpha-diversity of herbs were unrelated to elevation. Herbaceous species turnover was high, ranging between 0.46 and 0.89, with its maximum between 2700 and 3000 m. Hump-shaped relationship was observed for shrubs with maximum richness between 2000 and 2200 m; and alpha-diversity decreased monotonically. Turnover of shrub species was highest between 2000 and 2500 m. Tree species richness was highest at low elevations, and alpha-diversity was relatively low along the entire gradient. Tree species turnover was also high in the lower zone and again at 2600-2800 m. Species richness of all vascular plants was highest at 2200-2500 m, and alpha-diversity was highest in the lower part of the gradient. Beta diversity of all growth forms was quite high ranging between 0.53 and 0.87along the entire gradient reflecting high species and structural turnover.

Equisimilis isolates from 32 humans and 8 companion animals and compared Simpson's diversity index of this genogrouping to those of multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and emm genotyping. CRISPRCasFinder detected a type II-A CRISPR array with the same repeat sequences in three whole-genome sequences. Subsequently, optimized polymerase chain reaction-based II -A CRISPR array amplification was performed to sequence the region around the leader and terminal repeat sequences. We conducted spacer genogrouping by evaluating the spacer sequence similarities. A phylogenetic dendrogram was constructed, and spacer content and polymorphisms were illustrated. Simpson's diversity indices were calculated for the CRISPR array genogrouping, MLST, and emm genotyping. We analyzed the as-sociation between the spacer genogroup with sequence type (ST)/emm genotype for each isolate. Of the 40 isolates, 39 with the II-A CRISPR array were amplified, sequenced, and assigned to 13 genogroups (A-M). The Simpson's diversity indices for the three typing were 0.874, 0.914, and 0.924, respectively. We found genetic lineages between genogroup M and ST127/stG245.0 and between genogroup I and ST29/stG485.0.

The study area comprised approximately 166 000 ha in the Kouilou Departement, Republic of Congo, a section of land targeted for extensive future development. In total 156 forest sample sites were surveyed using the Braun-Blanquet method of phytosociology. Diversity of each plant community was expressed in terms of species richness; Shannon-Wiener index; exponent of Shannon-Wiener index; evenness; Fisher's alpha; Simpson's index; and inverse Simpson index. Eleven plant communities were described and mapped at a much finer scale than has been done previously. The communities were arranged along two gradients: a degraded - relatively intact gradient and a wet - dry gradient. The least degraded communities, and consequently those with the highest conservation value, were the swamp forests and the koum forest. Overall, the values reported for the diversity parameters in the current study were within the range reported for other tropical forests in Central Africa. The study revealed a gradient between the coast (west) and the Mayombe mountain range (east) in plant diversity linked to topography and climate with plant diversity lowest at the coast. Furthermore, plant diversity was negatively related to the distance to human infrastructure. The forest communities appear to be fairly resilient to past anthropogenic disturbances, however, there is no historical analogue to the more severe types of forest destruction associated with some of the future developments anticipated, such as mechanized logging or mining.					van Rooyen, Margaretha W/AAC-9578-2022; van Rooyen, Margaretha W/K-3559-2019														0564-3295	2661-8982				DEC	2016	57	4					805	824																WOS:000397193000017

Diversity and community composition of ichthyofauna at Konhaye Stream, district Dir Lower, Pakistan	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												This study was undertaken to investigate the diversity, abundance ratio, and distribution of the fish species and to record the water quality of Konhaye Stream, district Dir Lower, Pakistan. A total of 16 fish species were recorded, belonging to 4 orders (Cypriniformes, Channiformes, Siluriformes and Mastacebilformes), and 5 families including Cyprinidae (Schizopyge esocinus, Racoma labiata, Cyprinion watsoni, Cyprinus carpio, Barilius pakistanicus, B. vagra, B. modestus, Crossocheilus diplocheilus, Garra gotyla, Puntius ticto, and P. sophore), Channidae (Channa punctatus and Channa gachua), Nemacheilidae (Schistura macrolepis), Sisoidae (Glyptothorax punjabensis), and Mastacembelidae (Mastacembelus armatus). Different ichthyo-diversity indices [Simpson's biodiversity index (D=0.918), Simpson's reciprocal index (1/D=1.088), Simpson's evenness index (E-1/D=0.068), species richness (S), Shannon-Weiner's index (H'=3.775), Menhinick's index (D-mn=0.804), and Margalef's index (D-mg=2.510)] were calculated for the stream. The physicochemical parameters [temperature (23.125 +/- 3.514 degrees C), dissolved Oxygen (9.003 +/- 0.627 mg L-1), pH (7.333 +/- 0.201), turbidity (76.5 +/- 6.403 NTU), electric conductivity (201.68 +/- 11.31 mu s cm(-1)), free CO2 (124.75 +/- 9.912 ppm), total dissolved solids (126.1 +/- 9.477 ppm), total alkalinity (4.325 +/- 0.171 mg L-1), total suspended solids (127.1 +/- 6.864 ppm), total hardness (5.225 +/- 0.341 mg L-1), salinity (42.25 +/- 6.292 ppt), calcium hardness (2.975 +/- 0.670 mg L-1), magnesium hardness (105 +/- 9.954 mg L-1), potassium (0.0145 +/- 0.001 mg L-1), sodium (16.55 +/- 3.861 mg L-1), chloride (1.825 +/- 0.727 mg L-1), and nitrate (0.053 +/- 0.006 mg L-1) level] were monitored and found to be in varying but permissible ranges. The stream was found to be harboring a number of economically valuable fish species. An exotic fish species, C. carpio, was found well flourished, indicating the potential of the stream to be used for mitigating the declining ichthyofaunal diversity in the main nearby rivers. Two species, P. sophore and P. ticto, were recorded for the first time from the district. Proper management, appropriate fish stocking, and implementing environmental/fishing laws are suggested for the maintenance of the diversity and alleviating anthropogenic stress/threats.

J	Okuda, T; Yonezaki, S; Kiyota, M				Okuda, Takehiro; Yonezaki, Shiroh; Kiyota, Masashi			Spatio-temporal variation in the higher trophic level community structure of the western North Pacific pelagic ecosystem	DEEP-SEA RESEARCH PART II-TOPICAL STUDIES IN OCEANOGRAPHY												There are increasing demands for evaluation of the current status of marine ecosystems and impacts of environmental change and anthropogenic activities, but for the open ocean available data are quite limited. The Japanese driftnet survey dataset of Hokkaido University was used to analyze the spatio-temporal variations in the higher trophic level (HTL) community structure in the western North Pacific. The analyses were conducted by using subset of the data that was collected along four regularly surveyed transect lines at 155 degrees E, 170 degrees E, 175 degrees E and 180 degrees E spanning from 36 to 48 degrees N and from 1982 to 1996. Non-size-selective multiple mesh driftnets were used in the survey. Total number of individuals, species richness and Simpson index of species diversity indicated a longitudinal gradient with a lower abundance and diversity in the eastern area. Latitudinal gradient was clear for numerical abundance and species richness, but no trend for Simpson diversity index. Temporal patterns in the HTL community structure were not consistent among the three metrics: numerical abundance showed a significantly decrease and increasing fluctuations in later years, species richness was increased along years, and Simpson index did not show any clear temporal trends. The inconsistency in the temporal patterns of community metrics was considered to arise from the effects of the sampling scheme on community measurements and/or complex structural changes such as the emergence of dominant species related to regime shifts. These results suggest the importance of proper consideration of temporal changes in the sampling scheme when analyzing long-term data. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Karagöz, ED; Ünlükaplan, Y				Karagoz, Elif Dilan; Unlukaplan, Yueksel			Mathematical expression of the effects of thermal power plants on landscape diversity Example of Yeniköy-Kemerköy Thermal Power Plant	JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE OF GAZI UNIVERSITY												Studying the landscape change depending on human activities and associating this change with activity is important for making the appropriate planning decisions. In this study, it was aimed to determine how an activity that seriously damages to the environment, such as a thermal power plant, causes a change in CORINE Land Cover/Land Uses (LC/LU ) classes between 1990 and 2018. In this context, it has all the units of the Yenikoy-Kemerkoy Thermal power plant within the lower basin boundary, which has been selected as the study area and is considered an ecological boundary. The landscape types of the study area, which consists of a total of two micro-catchments, a sub-basin and a separate basin, were determined by the 2018 CORINE LC/LU classes and Forest Stand types. As a result of the change detection carried out with the ArcGIS 10.6.1 program, supported by Geographic Information Systems (GIS), the change and transformation between LC/LU classes were examined. Diversity indices were calculated by considering the number of units and area sizes of the determined landscape types. The effect of such measurements on landscape management has been discussed by mathematically demonstrating how this change affects landscape diversity through diversity indices. According to the calculated Shannon and Simpson Diversity Indices, the diversity of the area is high both in the whole area and in the micro-catchment's basis. It has been discussed in the results section of the study that this high diversity is not a diversity that includes ecological richness in the expected sense and that it is a result of fragmentation caused by the activity.																			1300-1884	1304-4915					2024	39	1					151	160		10.17341/gazimmfd.1162809	http://dx.doi.org/10.17341/gazimmfd.1162809													WOS:001058089000013
J	Butturi-Gomes, D; Petrere, M; Giacomini, HC; De Marco, P				Butturi-Gomes, Davi; Petrere Junior, Miguel; Giacomini, Henrique C.; De Marco Junior, Paulo			Computer intensive methods for controlling bias in a generalized species diversity index	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The use of diversity indices is a common practice in studies of community ecology. Historically, the main indices were derived by Shannon and Simpson. Currently, these two indices are recognized as part of families of entropy-based indices, which generally include species richness as another particular case. This paper evaluates the statistical properties of one of these families, the Tsallis index, as dependent on four factors: (i) spatial distribution of individuals; (ii) species-abundance distributions; (iii) sampling method and (iv) the estimator. To do so, we carried out computer simulations. The maximum likelihood estimator under all scenarios produced more biased estimates than the two computationally intensive estimation methods (i.e., Jackknife and bootstrap). The Broken-Stick was the species-abundance distribution that led to lowest bias, particularly in the species richness estimation. Intermediate levels of spatial-aggregation of individuals were also related to less biased estimations of diversity. The effect of quadrat size upon the bias of estimation was weak, despite the fact that such sampling method often produces a non-random sample of individuals. On the one hand, the Jackknife method was more accurate than the bootstrap, although both methods have shown poor performances for diversity indices that emphasize species richness. On the other hand, if confidence intervals are needed for individual community samples, the bootstrap is strongly recommended over the Jackknife. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Factors affecting the stability of arthropod community in turn influence the relationship between arthropod diversity and stability, which has been rarely investigated. We conducted a 2-year field-experiment in Shanghai and Jiangsu province in eastern China, examining the effects of the ecological engineering of ground cover plant Trifolium repens on the diversity and stability of canopy arthropod community in peach orchards. The results indicated that five diversity indices (abundance, species richness, Simpson's index, Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou's evenness index) and four stability indices (N-n/N-p,S-n/S-p,(N-n + N-d)/N-p and (S-n, + S-d)/S-p) were all significantly higher but the coefficient of variation (d(s)/d(m)) was significantly lower in ground cover areas than control areas. The results of Pearson's correlations were significantly negative for abundance/richness and the above four stability indices both in ground cover areas and control ones in both sites; correlations between Pielou evenness index and the above four stability indices were all positive in control areas, while those in ground cover areas were not the same. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding for arthropod community stability, suggesting that regulating harmful arthropods by beneficial and neutral arthropods was the basic implication of arthropod stability, and demonstrates that the ecological engineering of ground cover T. repens can enhance the diversity and stability of canopy arthropod communities but increased arthropod diversity will not always positively affect arthropod stability.

Here, we tested whether and to what degree fungal diversity was related to habitat types and compared diversity patterns of woody plants and soil fungi. We carried out field investigations on soil fungi in different habitat types (i.e., valleys, foothills, hillsides, and hilltops) in a 25-ha karst broadleaf forest in Southwest China. The tree richness, Shannon index, and Simpson index significantly increased from valleys to hilltops. While the soil fungal N-1 diversity (the exponential Shannon index) marginally increased toward valleys, fungal N-0 (richness) and N-2 (the inverse Simpson index) diversity exhibited significantly reduced and increased patterns, respectively, from valleys to hilltops. The major fungal functional groups (i.e., EcM, AM, saprotrophic, and pathogenic fungi) showed similar increasing richness patterns in valleys. Moreover, woody plant alpha diversity was an important indicator of fungal functional groups except for EcM and AM fungi. In addition, woody plants increased in species turnover rate (beta SIM) from valleys to hilltops, while fungal species had a concave distribution. The pat-terns of nestedness (beta SNE) for tree species decreased from valleys to hilltops, while the opposite was true for soil fungal species. Our findings indicated that the diversity patterns of woody plants and fungi were inconsistent among habitat types, and the relationships between fungal and woody plant communities depended on habitat types in the karst forest.					li, wei/IUQ-2973-2023	Peng, Wanxia/0000-0002-4267-8544													0378-1127	1872-7042				OCT 15	2020	474								118367	10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118367	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118367													WOS:000578989600016

(Diptera: Drosophilidae) has richly contributed to the understanding of patterns of inheritance, variation, speciation, and evolution. Drosophila, with its cosmopolitan nature and complexities in species compositions, is an excellent model for studying the eco-distributional patterns of various species. This study analyzed the altitudinal and seasonal variation in Drosophila species of Mount Japfu in Nagaland, a sub-Himalayan hilly state of northeast India, over the course of one year. A total of 4,680 Drosophila flies belonging to 19 species of 4 subgenera were collected at altitudes of 1500, 1800, 2100, 2400, and 2700 m a.s.l. The subgenus Sophophora Sturtevant was predominant, with 10 species, followed by subgenus Drosophila, with 4 species. Subgenus Dorsilopha and subgenus Scaptodrosophila were represented by 1 species each. The remaining 3 species were not identified. Cluster analysis and constancy methods were used to analyze the species occurrence qualitatively. Altitudinal changes in the population densities and relative abundances of the different species at different seasons were also studied. The diversity of the Drosophila community was assessed by applying Simpson's diversity index. At 1800 m a.s.l., the Simpson's index was low (0.09301), suggesting high Drosophila diversity at this altitude. The density of Drosophila changed significantly during different seasons (F = 26.72; df = 2; p < 0.0001). The results suggest the distributional pattern of a species or related group of species was uneven in space and time.

Impact of disturbance on species diversity and composition of <i>Cyperus conglomeratus</i> plant community in southern Jeddah, Saudi Arabia	JOURNAL OF KING SAUD UNIVERSITY SCIENCE												The changes in species diversity and composition of Cyperus conglomeratus plant community caused by anthropogenic disturbance were estimated and analyzed in four selected sites at southern Jeddah in Saudi Arabia. The ecological disturbances in the study area have their major effect on species richness, where about 76% of the perennial species in the study area were disappeared as the result of the human impact on C. conglomeratus community in the most disturbed sites. Interspecific competition results from C. conglomeratus indicated that it is a competitor species led to exclusion of the other species from the highly disturbed sites which affected by the Industrial City in Jeddah. Therefore, resulting in a remarkable decrease in species diversity (Shannon's index = 0.664) coinciding with maximum dominance of C. conglomeratus (Simpson's index = 0.656). The general trend of plant species richness and diversity in moderately disturbed sites in the study area showed remarkable increase in both richness (S = 16 species) and diversity (Shannon's index = 1.792), coinciding with minimum dominance (Simpson's index = 0.253). The resulting graphs of species abundance distribution models representing the highly disturbed sites tend toward geometric series pattern of species abundances, where one (C. conglomeratus) species dominate the community with the remainder fairly uncommon, assuming competitive exclusion and resource exhaustion in such degraded and harsh ecosystems.

Factor analyses to select landscape-level metrics were undertaken on 25 landscapes classified at four levels of thematic resolution. The landscapes were located within seven countries. The different resolutions were considered appropriate to taxonomic and functional group diversity. As class-level metrics are often better correlated to ecological response, the landscape-level metric subsets gained through exploratory analysis were additionally used to guide the selection of class-level metric subsets. Linear mixed models were then used to detect correlations between landscape- and class-level metrics and species richness values. Taxonomic groups with differing requirements (plants, birds, different arthropod groups) and also functional arthropod groups were examined. At the coarse scale of thematic resolution grain metrics (patch density, largest patch index) emerged as rough indicators for the different biological groups whilst at the fine scale a diversity metric (e.g. Simpson's diversity index) was appropriate. The intermediate thematic resolution offered most promise for biodiversity monitoring. Metrics included largest patch index, edge density, nearest neighbour, the proximity index, circle and Simpson's diversity index. We suggest two possible applications of these metrics in the context of biodiversity monitoring and the identification of biodiversity hot spots in European agricultural landscapes.

This study applied Simpson Index of Diversity (SID) to panel data from National Income Dynamics Study from 2008 to 2017 to investigate these variations across four provinces of South Africa. Findings point to the importance of disaggregating when analysing household income diversification. Limpopo, KwaZulu-Natal and North West had higher SID than the aggregated index, while Eastern Cape had lower degree of diversification. Contrary to other studies, this study found provinces with the highest and lowest income not having the highest degree of diversification. Over time, households diversified more, with SID increasing from 0.16-0.23 by 2017. The study recommends supporting households diversify their income. Specifically, the study recommends support for agriculture in KwaZulu-Natal, Eastern Cape and Limpopo, while in North West, provincial government should promote business ventures to improve household resilience.

Characterization of the flora diversity of the San Ignacio oasis, Baja California Sur	REVISTA CHAPINGO SERIE CIENCIAS FORESTALES Y DEL AMBIENTE												Introduction: Sustainable management of oases needs knowledge of the conditions of composition and diversity of the species living there. Objective: Estimating and comparing the diversity and structure of vegetation in the tree, shrub and herbaceous strata of the San Ignacio oasis, Baja California Sur, Mexico. Materials and methods: A total of 140 circular sites (500 m2) were randomly located, where 20 m2 and 1 m2 sites were nested to record the vegetation in the herbaceous, shrub and tree strata. Species richness, Shannon-Wiener, Simpson, Pielou and species importance value indices were used to estimate plant diversity in the strata and to characterize their structure. Results and discussion: A total of 53 taxa were distributed in 17 orders, 25 families and 47 genera. Richness, diversity and homogeneity were higher in the herbaceous stratum (S = 41, H & PRIME; = 3.21, J & PRIME; = 8.64, respectively) and lower in the arboreal stratum (S = 21, H & PRIME; = 2.01, J & PRIME;= 0.688). Regarding the importance value index, the species with the highest ecological weight was Prosopis articulata S. Watson (33.35 %) for the herbaceous stratum, Cylindropuntia alcahes (F. A. B. Weber) F. M. Kunth (65.60 %) for shrub and Phoenix dactylifera L. (92.94 %) for the arboreal stratum. Conclusions: Vegetation richness and diversity were higher in the herbaceous stratum. This study represents a baseline of indicators useful for the evaluation of changes generated by natural or anthropogenic events in the San Ignacio oasis.

Ramananda; Oinam, Gunajit			A Study on Ichthyofaunal Diversity of Lake Kharungpat, Manipur, India	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY												Biodiversity has been defined as the variability among living organism from all sources including, terrestrial, marine and other aquatic ecosystems and the ecological complexes of which they are part; this includes diversity within species, between species, and of ecosystems. The fish diversity of lake Kharungpat comprised of 29 species under 20 genera, 11 families and 6 orders. The study revealed that, among the identified fish species Amblypharyngodon mola, Esomus dandricus, Puntius sophore and Channa orientalis was found to be highly abundant. The recorded six orders comprised namely, Cypriniformes, Siluriformes, Anabantiformes, Perciformes, Gobiiformes and Synbranchiformes. The Cypriniformes formed one of the most dominant order as compared to all other orders recorded in the present study comprising of 52 % of the total fish species of the lake. Cyprinidae family was the most dominant comprising of 52 % of the total fish species. The study observed that, maximum ichthyofaunal diversity was recorded in the month of July, 2020 (29 species). The maximum and minimum value of Simpson index was recorded during December, 2019 and August, 2020 with an index value of 0.9278 and 0.6778, respectively. The observed Shannon index value showed maximum in September, 2019 (2.843). The present finding indicated a less healthy environment of the lake. Proper actions are needful by the concerned agencies with respect to the fish diversity of the lake and maintenance of sustainable fish production without sacrificing the lake's ecosystem with the help of full participation of community.																			0030-9923					OCT	2022	54	5					2105	2109		10.17582/journal.pjz/20210622110641	http://dx.doi.org/10.17582/journal.pjz/20210622110641													WOS:000907309700014

Given a community composed by individuals of different types, we study the problem of partitioning this community such that the global diversity is preserved as much as possible in each subgroup. We consider the diversity metric introduced by Simpson in his influential work that, roughly speaking, corresponds to the inverse probability that two individuals are from the same type when taken uniformly at random, with replacement, from the community of interest. We provide a novel perspective by reinterpreting this quantity in geometric terms. We characterize the instances in which the optimal partition exactly preserves the global diversity in each subgroup. When this is not possible, we provide an efficient polynomial-time algorithm that outputs an optimal partition for the problem with two types. Finally, we discuss further challenges and open questions for the problem that considers more than two types.

The area witnessed a devastating earthquake in 2005 causing destruction of forests and infrastructure thus forcing people to leave the region. The major aim of the study was to assess the biodiversity of NWFPs in the earthquake hit areas. The research was done on the onset of fall season in order to check the resource availability in the autumn season for the local communities that what kind of NWFPs enjoy growing in this season. The study involved the conventional method of conducting the vegetation inventory. In the study frequency, density and diversity indices i.e. Shannon- wiener and Simpson diversity indices were calculated. A Total of 66 species from about 37 families were observed from the study sites. The observed plant species that were identified constituted species of herbs (72%) shrubs species (23%) and fern species (5%). There were about 40% NWFPs in the target locations that were intensively used in different capacities by local inhabitant. As expected the diversity of the species were on the low side due to the autumn season. The diversity in the Bagh district though was somehow greater as compared to Neelam District. The research is a baseline resource assessment study for policy makers and management depicting the biodiversity of NWFPs for better management of this resource.					aslam, kashif/W-9100-2019; Haq, Ahsan Ul/AAZ-3097-2020														1018-4619	1610-2304					2019	28	11A					8591	8600																WOS:000498337300035

It is believed that river substrate heterogeneity is positively correlated with benthic macroinvertebrate diversity in rivers. In this paper, based on field data, we run quantitative analysis on the correlation between river substrate heterogeneity and benthic macroinvertebrate diversity. Taking a typical river of Oujiang in Zhejiang Province, China as an example, a coefficient of so-called non-uniformity index is used to characterize the river heterogeneity. The diversity of benthic macroinvertebrate is characterized by the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson index. Strong positive relationships between non-uniformity coefficient of river substrate and biodiversity index of benthic macroinvertebrate are observed. The results could be used to support decision-making tools in river restoration planning and management.					, Xianfu/AHC-4026-2022; PENG, JING/JNT-2157-2023																978-7-302-33544-3				2013							3287	3296																WOS:000343761504048

The members of the network who are not leaders form their opinions using the French-DeGroot model of opinion dynamics. To quantify the diversity of such a system, we adapt two diversity measures from ecology to our setting, the Simpson Diversity Index and the Shannon Index. Using these two measures, we formalize the problem of how to place a single leader with opinion 1, given a network with a leader with opinion theta, so as to maximize the opinion diversity.

Using airborne and DESIS imaging spectroscopy to map plant diversity across the largest contiguous tract of tallgrass prairie on earth	REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT												Grassland ecosystems are under threat globally, primarily due to land-use and land-cover changes that have adversely affected their biodiversity. Given the negative ecological impacts of biodiversity loss in grasslands, there is an urgent need for developing an operational biodiversity monitoring system that functions in these ecosystems. In this paper, we assessed the capability of airborne and spaceborne imaging spectroscopy (also known as hyperspectral imaging) to capture plant alpha-diversity in a large naturally-assembled grassland while considering the impact of common management practices, specifically prescribed fire. We collected a robust in -situ plant diversity data set, including species composition and percent cover from 2500 sampling points with different burn ages, from recently-burned to transitional and pre-prescribed fire at the Joseph H. Williams Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in Oklahoma, USA. We expressed in-situ plant alpha-diversity using the first three Hill numbers, including species richness (number of observed species in a plant community), exponential Shannon entropy index (hereafter Shannon diversity; effective number of common species, where species are weighed proportional to their percent cover), and inverse Simpson concentration index (hereafter Simpson diversity; effective number of dominant species, where more weight is given to dominant species) at four different plot sizes, including 60 m x 60 m, 120 m x 120 m, 180 m x 180 m, and 240 m x 240 m. We collected full-range airborne hyperspectral data with fine spatial resolution (1 m) and visible and near-infrared spaceborne hyper -spectral data from DESIS sensor with coarse spatial resolution (30 m), and used the spectral diversity hypoth-esis-i.e., that the variability in spectral data is largely driven by plant diversity-to estimate alpha-diversity remotely. In recently-burned plots and those at the transitional stage, both airborne and spaceborne data were capable of capturing Simpson diversity-a metric that calculates the effective number of dominant species by emphasizing abundant species and discounting rare species-but not species richness or Shannon diversity. Further, neither airborne nor spaceborne hyperspectral data sets were capable of capturing plant alpha-diversity of 60 m x 60 m or 120 m x 120 m plots. Based on these results, three main findings emerged: (1) management practices influence grassland biodiversity patterns that can be remotely detected, (2) both fine-and coarse -resolution remotely-sensed data can detect the effective number of dominant species (e.g., Simpson diversity), and (3) attention should be given to site-specific plant diversity field data collection to appropriately interpret remote sensing results. Findings of this study indicate the feasibility of estimating Simpson diversity in naturally -assembled grasslands using forthcoming spaceborne imagers such as National Aeronautics and Space Adminis-tration's Surface Biology and Geology mission.

While integrating organic practices into cocoa agroforestry may further enhance these potentials, empirical and robust data to support this claim is lacking, and mechanisms for biodiversity conservation and the provision of environmental and ecological benefits are poorly understood. A field study was conducted in the Eastern Region of Ghana to evaluate the potential of organic cocoa agroforests to conserve native floristic diversity in comparison with conventional cocoa agroforests. Shade tree species richness, Shannon, Simpson's reciprocal and Margalef diversity indices were estimated from 84 organic and conventional cocoa agroforestry plots. Species importance value index, a measure of how dominant a species is in a given ecosystem, and conservation status were used to evaluate the conservation potential of shade trees on studied cocoa farms. Organic farms recorded higher mean shade tree species richness (5.10 +/- 0.38) compared to conventional farms (3.48 +/- 0.39). Similarly, mean Shannon diversity index, Simpson's reciprocal diversity index and Margalef diversity index were significantly higher on organic farms compared to conventional farms. According to the importance value index, fruit and native shade tree species were the most important on both organic and conventional farms for all the cocoa age groups but more so on organic farms. Organic farms maintained 14 native tree species facing a conservation issue compared to 10 on conventional cocoa farms. The results suggest that diversified organic cocoa farms can serve as reservoirs of native tree species, including those currently facing conservation concerns thereby providing support and contributing to the conservation of tree species in the landscape.

J	Pélissier, R; Couteron, P; Dray, S; Sabatier, D				Pélissier, R; Couteron, P; Dray, S; Sabatier, D			Consistency between ordination techniques and diversity measurements:: Two strategies for species occurrence data	ECOLOGY												Both the ordination of taxonomic tables and the measurements of species diversity aim to capture the prominent features of the species composition of a community. However, interrelations between ordination techniques and diversity measurements are seldom explicated and are mainly ignored by many field ecologists. This paper starts from the notion of the species occurrence table, which provides a unifying formulation for different kinds of taxonomic data, Here it is demonstrated that alternative species weightings can be used to equate the total inertia of a centered-by-species occurrence table with common diversity indices, such as species richness, Simpson diversity, or Shannon information. Such an equation defines two main ordination strategies related to two different but consistent measures of species diversity. The first places emphasis on scarce species and is based on Correspondence Analysis and species richness (CA-richness strategy). The second, in which abundant species are prominent, relies on Non-Symmetric Correspondence Analysis and Simpson diversity (NSCA-Simpson strategy). Both strategies are suitable for measuring alpha and beta diversity by analyzing the centered-by-species, occurrence table with respect to external environmental or instrumental variables. In this paper, these two strategies are applied to ecological data obtained in a Neotropical rainforest plot. The results are then discussed with respect to the intrinsic characteristics of the community under analysis, and also to the broad classes of floro-faunistic data used in ecology (i.e., data gathered from museum or herbarium collections, exhaustive inventories in a reference plot, or enumeration through species-by-releves tables), The approach encompasses several well-known techniques such as Correspondence Analysis, Non-Symmetric Correspondence Analysis, Canonical Correspondence Analysis. and Redundancy Analysis, and provides greater insight into interrelations between ordination methods and diversity studies.

The diversity and spatial distribution of butterflies in four habitats, i.e., roadside, garden, plantation and forest, were assessed from March to June 2021 to document the checklist of butterfly species on the campus during the spring and the summer seasons in Rain Forest Research Institute, Jorhat, India. In the present study, 613 individuals from 44 species belonging to five families, i.e., Nymphalidae, Pieridae, Lycaenidae, Papilionidae and Hesperiidae, were recorded by transect walk method. The maximum richness and abundance of butterfly species was found during the summer season (May-June). The family Nymphalidae recorded the highest percentage of species and individuals among the sampled butterfly families during both the seasons. This family also showed the highest Simpson dominance index, Shannon diversity index and Margalef index during both the seasons. The analysis of alpha diversity indices showed the highest values of Simpson dominance index, Shannon diversity index and Margalef index in the roadside and garden habitat and the lowest in the plantation habitat. The models on abundance distribution (ADM) showed a significant difference in butterfly species composition in the forest habitat during the spring season and both the forest and plantation habitats during the summer season. Among the sampled butterfly species, six were categorized as threatened under Schedules II and IV of India's Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972. The outcomes of this study highlight the relevance of this institutional campus as a butterfly's preferred habitat, offering a rich environment for butterfly conservation and future research studies. The study will further aid in the long-term conservation efforts of the butterfly species and their habitats.

However, the relative importance of stand spatial structural diversity and species diversity to restored stand carbon stocks remains unclear. To address this issue, we conducted a sample plot setup in the Loess Plateau with the aim of exploring the effects of stand spatial structural diversity and species diversity on forest carbon stocks. Therefore, we determined index parameters for species diversity (Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, and Pielou) and spatial structural diversity (Angular scale, Mingling, Aggregation, and Competition) within the oak forest ecosystem. We examined carbon storage in all vegetation organs and different soil layers. Additionally, we employed a structural equation model to develop a model that illustrates the effects of stand spatial structure and species diversity on ecosystem carbon storage. The results reveal that stand spatial structure and species diversity influence the ecosystem carbon storage through biomass (trees and litter) and soil carbon (0-100 cm). Stand spatial structure exhibits positive direct effects (path coefficients: 0.764 and 0.890), while species diversity shows negative direct effects (-0.320 and -0.206) on biomass and soil carbon, respectively. Finally, the total effect of spatial structure diversity on forest carbon storage surpasses that of species diversity. Therefore, stand spatial structure should be adjusted preferentially during forest management in fragile ecological environment. Our results provide important insights into the climate change mitigation potential associated with the structurebased management of forests.																			1470-160X	1872-7034				2024 JAN	2024	158								111449	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111449	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111449		DEC 2023											WOS:001143549900001
J	Jost, L				Jost, Lou			Partitioning diversity into independent alpha and beta components	ECOLOGY												Existing general definitions of beta diversity often produce a beta with a hidden dependence on alpha. Such a beta cannot be used to compare regions that differ in alpha diversity. To avoid misinterpretation, existing definitions of alpha and beta must be replaced by a definition that partitions diversity into independent alpha and beta components. Such a unique definition is derived here. When these new alpha and beta components are transformed into their numbers equivalents ( effective numbers of elements), Whittaker's multiplicative law ( alpha x beta gamma) is necessarily true for all indices. The new beta gives the effective number of distinct communities. The most popular similarity and overlap measures of ecology (Jaccard, Sorensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indices) are monotonic transformations of the new beta diversity. Shannon measures follow deductively from this formalism and do not need to be borrowed from information theory; they are shown to be the only standard diversity measures which can be decomposed into meaningful independent alpha and beta components when community weights are unequal.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				OCT	2007	88	10					2427	2439		10.1890/06-1736.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/06-1736.1								18027744					WOS:000250714200002

Water quality values of temperature, pH level, dissolved oxygen total dissolved solids, salinity, and conductivity were measured. The waterbird species richness was assessed using the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices. The results of the prediction model in the Generalized Linear Model showed water temperature to be an important environmental variable to explain the richness of waterbird species. However, a meaningful relationship was not identified to support the relationship between the richness of the waterbird species and other water quality variables. In addition, the Multiple Linear Regression model determined that pH level together with water temperature has a positive effect on the waterbird species in the Ahlat Marshes. The marshes exhibit "low variety" according to the Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index, with the highest value at observation point A6 surrounded by protected dense marshland. At the same observation point, we also found "highest dominance" based on the Simpson Index. During the study, it was recorded 1128 individuals belonging to 15 resident species were identified. The Rallidae waterbird family represented the highest species composition (41.5%). Water temperature, pH level, and DO parameters between the independent variables affected the waterbird abundance by 20%.

J	Hu, XS; He, FL; Hubbell, SP				Hu, Xin-Sheng; He, Fangliang; Hubbell, Stephen P.			Species diversity in local neutral communities	AMERICAN NATURALIST												We extend the neutral theory of macroecology by deriving biodiversity models (relative species abundance and species-area relationships) in a local community-metacommunity system in which the local community is embedded within the metacommunity. We first demonstrate that the local species diversity patterns converge to that of the metacommunity as the size (scale) of the embedded local community increases. This result shows that in continuous landscapes no sharp boundaries dividing the communities at the two scales exist; they are an artificial distinction made by the current spatially implicit neutral theory. Second, we remove the artificial restriction that speciation cannot occur in a local community, even if the effects of local speciation are small. Third, we introduce stochasticity into the immigration rate, previously treated as constant, and demonstrate that local species diversity is a function not only of the mean but also of the variance in immigration rate. High variance in immigration rates reduces species diversity in local communities. Finally, we show that a simple relationship exists between the fundamental diversity parameter of neutral theory and Simpson's index for local communities. Derivation of this relationship extends recent work on diversity indices and provides a means of evaluating the effect of immigration on estimates of the fundamental diversity parameter derived from relative species abundance data on local communities.																			0003-0147	1537-5323				DEC	2007	170	6					844	853		10.1086/522935	http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/522935								18171167					WOS:000250832000007

An algorithm to compute data diversity index in spatial networks	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION												Diversity is an important measure that according to the context, can describe different concepts of general interest: competition, evolutionary process, immigration, emigration and production among others. It has been extensively studied in different areas, as ecology, political science, economy, sociology and others. The quality of spatial context of the city can be gauged through this measure. The spatial context with its corresponding dataset can be modelled using spatial networks. Consequently, this allows us to study the diversity of data present in this specific type of networks. In this paper we propose an algorithm to measure diversity in spatial networks based on the topology and the data associated to the network. In the experiments developed with networks of different sizes, it is observed that the proposed index is independent of the size of the network, but depends on its topology. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Identification and investigation of species diversity and richness of the Gastropoda in intertidal zone of Bushehr Port coastal area (the Persian Gulf waters)	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES SCIENCES												This study aims to identify and determine species diversity and richness of the Gastropods of the intertidal zone of Bushehr seaport coastal area and assess the ecological status of this area using Welch index. Sampling was carried out at 6 stations in Bushehr seaport in the winter and summer seasons during 2013-2014. Bed sediment sampling was done three times in each station and Gastropod samples were collected using Quadrate (25x25 cm), and were then preserved using 4 % buffered formalin. The preserved samples were transported to the laboratory and were identified and counted by using valid identification keys. Furthermore, physicochemical properties of water including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO) and salinity were also measured in each station. According to the results obtained from this study, there were totally 14 species identified from 12 families belonging to 7 orders. The most abundantly identified species in the studied stations belonged to Planaxis sulctus, Cerithidea cingulate, and Anachis misera. In this study species diversity was determined by using Shannon-Weiner index, dominant species were investigated using Simpson index and species richness was calculated using Margalef index. The results of Shannon and Margalef indexes showed significant differences between the sampled stations and seasons (p<0.05). Moreover, the results of Simpson index showed no significant differences between the sampled stations and seasons (p<0.05). Results of Welch index showed that based on the mentioned indexes in the sampled stations the status of the water quality was classified as average and rather low/weak pollution.						obeidi, razagh/0000-0003-0377-002X													1562-2916						2019	18	2					355	370		10.22092/ijfs.2018.117729	http://dx.doi.org/10.22092/ijfs.2018.117729													WOS:000461362300013

Crucial role of rare taxa in preserving bacterial community stability	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Stable bacterial communities are essential for maintaining soil functions. However, the role of abundant and rare bacterial taxa in maintaining bacterial community stability remains controversial. To explore the relationship between abundant and rare taxa and bacterial community stability, we used high-throughput sequencing technology and molecular ecological networks to characterize the distribution of abundant and rare bacterial taxa under different nitrogen (N) fertilization rates (0, 150, 200, and 250 kg N hm-2). Our findings revealed that rare taxa had much higher Simpson's diversity index values than abundant taxa. Moreover, rare taxa Simpson's diversity decreased with increasing N application, while bacterial community differences (Bray-Curtis distance dissimilarity) increased (i.e., bacterial community stability decreased with increasing N application). The network topology showed that rare sub-communities had higher modularity and a greater proportion of positive links than abundant taxa. The rare bacterial Simpson's diversity was significantly and negatively correlated with bacterial community differences, no correlation occurred between abundant bacterial Simpson's diversity and bacterial community differences. This study underscores the importance of rare species in maintaining bacterial community stability. Consequently, when optimizing agricultural management practices to ensure the stability of bacterial communities and soil functions, it is crucial not only to concentrate consider the roles of abundant species involved in nutrient cycling but also to give greater consideration to the role of rare taxa.

J	McLaughlin, JE; McLaughlin, GW; McLaughlin, J				McLaughlin, Jacqueline E.; McLaughlin, Gerald W.; McLaughlin, Josetta			Using composite metrics to measure student diversity in higher education	JOURNAL OF HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT												The role and impact of diversity in higher education has permeated conversations about student access and achievement for many years. Language articulated by various courts suggests that higher education policies should reflect a broad conceptualisation of diversity beyond that of the magnitude and proportion of race and ethnicity, yet institutions struggle to measure diversity in a manner that effectively supports the management of diversity goals and meets the legal requirements for targeted strategies. Building on methodologies from biology and political science, this paper proposes a new way of conceptualising and measuring diversity that addresses the limitations of traditional diversity metrics and accounts for race and race-neutral attributes within a single model. Using data from over 1500 colleges and universities, the development of a composite diversity index is demonstrated as a strategy for meeting organisational need to account for and measure multiple diversity attributes.																			1360-080X	1469-9508				MAR 4	2015	37	2					222	240		10.1080/1360080X.2015.1019124	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1360080X.2015.1019124													WOS:000354250500008
J	Feest, A; Cardoso, P				Feest, Alan; Cardoso, Pedro			The comparison of site spider "biodiversity quality" in Portuguese protected areas	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Spiders at 23 Portuguese protected area sites were sampled (pitfall trapped) over 10-month periods. The data allowed for a "biodiversity quality" assessment consisting of the following indices: Species Richness, Biomass, Simpson Index, Species Conservation Value Index and Population Density. These "biodiversity quality" characteristics were reviewed for relative indication of site spider "biodiversity quality". Spiders are proposed as a group of organisms that could be used to indicate part of the "biodiversity quality" of a site since they can be sampled in a standardised way and yield biodiversity indices for comparison spatially and temporally. The approach adopted in this paper allows a range of "biodiversity quality" indices to be measured for spiders in Portuguese protected areas which, in turn requires decisions from scientists, managers and politicians on what element or characteristic of biodiversity it is intended to be targeted.

Use high-throughput amplicon sequencing to investigate the abundances, diversity, and composition of a major microbial community which includes fungi and bacteria on the leaves of three dominant plant species (Populus xcanadensis Moench (PCM), Pinus tabuliformis Carr (PTC), and Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica (PSM)). PCM had the highest levels of total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and soluble sugars and starch, which were higher than PTC and PSM. In addition, the abundance, diversity, and composition of the phyllosphere microbial communities differed greatly among PCM, PTC, and PSM. PTC hold the highest phyllosphere bacterial Chao1 index, Shannon index, Simpson index, Pielou_e index, and Observed_species, as well as phyllosphere fungal Chao 1 index, Observed_species, Pielou_e index, Shannon index, and Simpson index. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota were the dominant phyllosphere microbial communities. Leaf characteristics, including TC, TN, TP, soluble sugar starch, and C/N, were the dominant factors affecting phyllosphere microbial communities. Trees of different genotypes have different leaf characteristics. Furthermore, PCM possesses distinct differences on total carbon and soluble sugar and starch content that deciduous and evergreen trees differ significantly. And plant traits are key factors that affect phyllosphere microbial community structure.

The study was carried out in Lembang, in 2020 using yellow sticky and fruit fly traps. The study showed 18 insect families belonging to the following orders: Coleoptera, Diptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Thysanoptera and Lepidoptera. These families consisted of 23 species and 45,489 individuals. The Shannon-Wiener (H') diversity index showed that the ecosystem had low to moderate diversity, which increased from planting to harvesting stages. The species evenness index (E) was low during the vegetative growth and increased during reproductive and harvesting stages. Simpson's dominance index (D) decreased with increasing diversity, from medium to low dominance category.																			1589-1623	1785-0037				2022 	2022	20	4					3367	3377		10.15666/aeer/2004_33673377	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/2004_33673377		MAY 2022											WOS:000834352700001

Quantitative Evaluation of Pedodiversity in the Russian Arctic and Subarctic (by Cartographic Data)	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												A quantitative assessment of the diversity of the soil cover components of the Arctic and Subarctic as shown on the Soil Map of Russian Federation, scale 1: 2.5 M was performed. Soil units of this map were combined with the mapping units on the map of soil-ecological zoning of the same scale, namely, soil districts (on the plains and in the mountains). For each soil district (total 60), average, minimum and maximum sizes of soil polygons, richness indices (total number of polygons and number of taxonomic units) were calculated, as well as species richness (Margalef, Menhinick), domination indices (Berger-Parker, MkIntosh, Simpson), complexity of the soil cover (divisibility index, complexity coefficient), diversity indices (Shannon, normalized Shannon index, Gini-Simpson), lateral differentiation, and a total score was derived by accounting the values of all calculated indices. The following quantitative characteristics of the soil cover were used to calculate the indices: the number of soil polygons, soil taxonomic groups, the length of boundaries, the area of polygons (including the average and maximum values) and their ratio. The soil diversity increases from the Arctic soil zone to the Subarctic arctic-tundra subzone and is accompanied by an increase in the areas of soil polygons. Pechorsko-Karskiy, Mezensko-Cheshskiy and Nizhneeniseyskiy plain soil districts, Koryakskiy, Anadyirskiy and Pekulneysko-Iskatenskiy mountain soil districts are characterized by maximum soil diversity, while the South-Novaya Zemlya mountain and plain soil districts - by the lowest one.

Based on 20 criteria, the most recommendable measures for the estimation of alpha diversity of species have been Fager's "number of moves per specimen", exponential Shannon's information (or H'), reciprocal Simpson's lambda, and species richness (number of species). However. the last index is only appropriate when sample sizes are approximately equal otherwise it can be misleading and Hurlbert's rarefaction method should be applied. The other measures tested, especially all equitability indices, have been shown to be problematic and should not be used regularly for the measurement of species diversity.

Remote sensing imagery has considerable potential to aid in the monitoring and prediction of biodiversity across many spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we explored the possibility of defining relationships between species diversity indices and Landsat ETM+ reflectance values for Hyrcanian forests in Golestan province of Iran. We used the COST model for atmospheric correction of the imagery. Linear regression models were implemented to predict measures of biodiversity (species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices) using various combinations of Landsat spectral data. Species richness was modeled using the band set ETM5, ETM7, DV1, wetness and variances of ETM1, ETM2 and ETM5 (adjusted R-2 = 0.59, RMSE = 1.51). Reciprocal of Simpson index was modeled using the band set NDVI, brightness, greenness, variances of ETM2. ETM5 and ETM7 (adjusted R-2=0.459 RMSE = 1.15). The results demonstrated that spectral reflectance from Landsat can be used to effectively model tree species diversity. Predictive map derived from the presented methodology can help evaluate spatial aspects and monitor tree species diversity of the studied forest. The methodology also facilitates the evaluation of forest management and conservation strategies in northern Iran. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Species Diversity and Stumpage Valuation of Timber Resources at Pasir Tengkorak Forest Reserve, Langkawi, Kedah	SAINS MALAYSIANA												Tropical forests are highly diverse and provide a great deal of economic value. They play an important role in providing goods and services which contribute to long-term social benefits in local communities. This study was carried out to examine the tree composition and estimate its economic value of timber resources in a lowland coastal forest. Four one ha plots were established in Pasir Tengkorak Forest Reserve in Langkawi, Kedah and the subplots measuring 10 x 10 m were established in each plot. All trees greater than 1 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) were identified and the parameters measured included tree height and diameter. The species diversity indices obtained for all four plots were relatively high. The Simpson's index of diversity ranges from 0.946 to 0.969, while the Shannon-Weiner index (H') ranges from 3.808 to 5.616. The Simpson's measure of evenness (1/D) ranges from 0.239 to 0.563 suggesting that species evenness in the four ha plots were low. Stumpage value of timber in the study area was quite high with average value of RM33,600.46 per ha. Regression analysis showed that the relationship between stumpage value and species diversity was significant at the 5% level.

The latter is indeed shifting in recent years from single-species to multi-taxon approaches. However, multi-taxonomic studies are quite rare due to the effort required for performing field surveys. In this context, remote sensing is a powerful tool, continuously providing consistent and open access data at a different range of spatial and temporal scales. In particular, the Sentinel-2 (S2) mission has great potential to produce reliable proxies for biological diversity. In beech forests of two Italian National Parks, we sampled the beetle fauna, breeding birds, and epiphytic lichens. First, we calculated Shannon's entropy and Simpson's diversity. Then, to produce variables for biodiversity assessment, we exploited S2 data acquired in the 4 years 2017-2021. S2 images were used to construct spectral bands and photosynthetic indices time series, from which 91 harmonic metrics were derived. For each taxon and multi-taxon community, we assessed the correlation with S2 harmonic metrics, biodiversity indices, and forest structural variables. Then, to assess the potential of the harmonic metrics in predicting species diversity in terms of Shannon's and Simpson's biodiversity indices, we also fit a random forests model between each diversity index and the best 10 harmonic metrics (in terms of absolute correlation, that is, the magnitude of the correlation) for each taxon. The models' performance was evaluated via the relative root mean squared error (RMSE%). Overall, 241 beetle, 27 bird, and 59 lichen species were recorded. The diversity indices were higher for the multi-taxon community than for the single taxa. They were generally higher in the CVDA site than in GSML, except for the bird community. The highest correlation values between S2 data and biodiversity indices were recorded in CVDA for multi-taxon and beetle communities (| r| = 0.52 and 0.38, respectively), and in GSML for lichen and beetle communities (| r| = 0.34 and 0.26, respectively). RMSE% ranged between 2.53 and 9.99, and between 8.1 and 16.8 for the Simpson and Shannon index, respectively. The most important variables are phase and RMSE of red-Edge bands for bird and lichen communities, while RMSE and time of tassel cap and from EVI indices for beetles and multi-taxon diversity. Our results demonstrate that S2 data can be used for identifying potential biodiversity hotspots, showing that the herein presented harmonic metrics are informative for several taxa inhabiting wood, giving concrete support to cost-effective biodiversity monitoring and nature-based forest management in complex mountain systems.

J	Özkan, K; Mert, A				Ozkan, Kursad; Mert, Ahmet			Comparisons of Deng Entropy-Based Taxonomic Diversity Measures with the Other Diversity Measures and Introduction to the New Proposed (Reinforced) Estimators	FORESTIST												Unlike the traditional diversity indices, taxonomic diversity indices take into account the distances based on morphological or functional properties of species or the distances among the species based on the topology of Linnaean classifications. Various taxonomic diversity measures have been developed, among which the most frequently used are Warwick and Clarke's taxonomic diversity (Delta), taxonomic distinctness (Delta*), and average taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+)) indices. These well-known indices are a natural extension of Simpson diversity and use abundance or presence data of the species. More recently, using Deng entropy from the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory, a new taxonomic measure was proposed by Ozkan (2018). By employing this new measure, weighted taxonomic diversity (T-o), unweighted taxonomic diversity (uT(o)), weighted taxonomic distinctness (T-O(+)), and unweighted taxonomic distinctness (uT(O)(+)) can be estimated. This study was addressed to compare the estimators (T-o, uT(o), T-O(+) and uT(O)(+)) with the most popular traditional diversity measures (Species richness (S), Shannon entropy (H), and Simpson's diversity index (1 - lambda)) and taxonomic diversity measures (taxonomic diversity (Delta), taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+)), and average taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+)). For comparisons, correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were applied using the plant data taken from 107 sample plots from Yazili Canyon Nature Park in Turkey. The results indicated that T-o, uT(o), T-O(+), and uT(O)(+), have significantly positive correlation with Delta, Delta*, Delta(+), S, H, and 1 - lambda (p <.01), and all these estimators that are located between taxonomic diversity/distinctness measures (Delta, Delta*, and Delta(+)) and traditional diversity measures (S, H, and 1-lambda) along the ordination diagram of the applied PCA. Thus, Deng entropy-based taxonomic diversity measures seem to represent not only traditional diversity indices but also taxonomic diversity measures. Reinforced estimators (maximum values of T-o, uT(o), T-O(+), and uT(O)(+)) were also improved and used in the present study. Acceptable results were provided from computer-generated simulations by using a hypothetical community dataset. All the computations and simulations were performed using a spreadsheet program created by the authors of this paper.

To this purpose, measures of biodiversity have been introduced as statistical summaries of the abundance vector. In particular, we take into consideration the Gini-Simpson and the Shannon-Wiener indices, along with the effective number of species calculated through these measures, proposed, respectively, by Laakso and Taa-gepera (Comp Polit Stud 12:3-25, 1979) and Leti (Statistica descrittiva, Bologna, Il Mulino, 1983). It is an open question how to associate to these indices a measure of uncertainty. In this paper we compare confidence intervals based on these measures, calculated through three different bootstrap methods: percentile, -t and accelerated bias-corrected percentile. We recommend to practitioners to use the percentile procedure, as it is straightforward and computationally feasible, providing results very close to those obtained by more complex techniques.

In our view, the Rao coefficient is a good candidate for an efficient functional diversity index. It is, in fact, a generalization of the Simpson's index of diversity and it can be used with various measures of dissimilarity between species (both those based on a single trait and those based on several traits). However, when intending to quantify the functional diversity, we have to make various methodological decisions such as how many and which traits to use, how to weight them, how to combine traits that are measured at different scales and how to quantify the species' relative abundances in a community. Here we discuss these issues with examples from real plant communities and argue that diversity within a single trait is often the most ecologically relevant information. When using indices based on many traits, we plead for careful a priori selection of ecologically relevant traits, although other options are also feasible. When combining many traits, often with different scales, methods considering the extent of species overlap in trait space can be applied for both the qualitative and quantitative traits. Another possibility proposed here is to decompose the variability of a trait in a community according to the relative effect of among- and within-species differentiation (with the latter not considered by current indices of functional diversity), in a way analogical to decomposition of Sum of squares in ANOVA. Further, we show why the functional diversity is more tightly related to species diversity (measured by Simpson index) when biomass is used as a measure of population abundance, in comparison with frequency. Finally, the general expectation is that functional diversity can be a better predictor of ecosystem functioning than the number of species or the number of functional groups. However, we demonstrate that some of the expectations might be overrated - in particular, the "sampling effect" in biodiversity experiments is not avoided when functional diversity is used as a predictor.

J	Wood, PJ; Armitage, PD				Wood, PJ; Armitage, PD			The response of the macroinvertebrate community to low-flow variability and supra-seasonal drought within a groundwater dominated stream	ARCHIV FUR HYDROBIOLOGIE												Information regarding the instream response to long supra-seasonal droughts, extending over more than one season, in largely perennial riverine systems is fragmentary compared to knowledge regarding floods. The macroinvertebrate community of a groundwater dominated river was investigated over an eight-year period which included two supra-seasonal drought events (1992 and 1996-1997). The community responded directly to changes in the discharge regime. Significant differences in the community abundance, the abundance of the amphipod Gammarus pulex, diversity indices (Shannon Wiener and Simpson diversity) and the Berger-Parker dominance index were recorded between drought, flow recovery and other (non-drought) years. Drought conditions resulted in extremely low community abundance, Gammarus pulex abundance and the Berger-Parker dominance index, and extremely high values of the Shannon Wiener and Simpson diversity indices. Recovery of the community extended over a two-year period and reflected recovery of flow associated with recharge of the groundwater aquifer. The results underline the continuing need for medium to long-term data series to investigate the response of instream communities to flow variability so that extreme events can be placed within the context of natural variability.

We surveyed vascular plant and bryophyte diversities and measured the habitat characteristics in six karst caves in south China with different disturbance histories (one had been disturbed by poultry feeding, three had been disturbed by tourism, and two were undisturbed). The plant diversity differences among the six caves were analyzed using cluster analysis, and the relationships of plant diversity and microhabitat were assessed using canonical correspondence analysis. We found a total of 43 angiosperm species from 27 families, 20 lycophyte and fern species from 9 families, and 20 species of bryophytes from 13 families in the six caves. Habitat characteristics including light intensity, air relative humidity, air temperature, and soil properties varied among the caves. The plant diversity in karst caves was not rich, but the species composition was unique. The caves with high disturbance had the lowest species richness, numbers of individuals, and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices but the highest Simpson's dominance indices. The caves with less disturbance had the highest numbers of species, numbers of individuals, and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices but the lowest Simpson's dominance indices. The disturbed caves were often dominated by drought-tolerant, tenacious mosses (bryophytes), while the relatively undisturbed caves contained abundant liverworts (bryophytes), which were better adapted to humid environments. Plant diversity in karst caves was closely related to habitat heterogeneity, light and water status, and nutrient availability. Tourism and poultry farming were associated with the degradation of vegetation in some karst caves. Protecting and restoring bryophytes might facilitate the settlement, growth, and succession of vascular plants in karst caves. Bryophytes can be used as indicators of overall plant diversity and restoration status in karst caves.

In total, 20 copepod species were identified. Density of copepods was high in spring and low in winter. Mesocyclops edax was the dominant species in summer, monsoon and fall, while Ectocyclops phaleratus and Eucyclops agilis were dominant in winter and spring respectively. Impact of selected physico-chemical parameters on population dynamics of copepods was also studied. Copepods density was positively correlated with temperature, pH, total dissolved solids (TDS) and turbidity and negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO). Shannon-Weaver diversity index, Simpson index, Pielou's evenness index, and Margalef index were calculated to find out diversity of copepods. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant difference (F=22.36, P=0.000) in copepods density of all seasons. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to find out correlation between copepod species and seasons.																			0030-9923					OCT	2015	47	5					1347	1353																WOS:000363996800017

Indices for monitoring biodiversity change: Are some more effective than others?	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Statistically rigorous methods for summarizing and reporting trends in the intactness of biodiversity are a key element of effective biodiversity monitoring programs. There are four major approaches for translating complex monitoring data into easily communicated summary statistics: (1) traditional diversity indices such as species richness and Simpson's diversity, (2) species intactness indices based on occurrence, (3) species intactness indices based on abundance, and (4) multivariate community indices. We use simulated data to evaluate the effectiveness of 13 indices from these four categories based on statistical robustness, sensitivity to errors and noise in the data, ecological relevance, and ease of communication. We show that indices that calculate species intactness using equations like Buckland's arithmetic mean index are the most effective for use in large-scale biodiversity intactness monitoring programs. Traditional diversity indices are unsuitable for monitoring of biodiversity intactness, and multivariate indices can be highly sensitive to errors and noise in the data. Finally, we provide guidelines for the application of these indices in biodiversity intactness monitoring. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The research is based on OBIA being developed on to bi-temporal summer and winter Sentinel-2 imagery. Fuzzy rules, which are based on topographic factors, such as terrain elevation and slope for the distribution of each tree species, derived from expert knowledge and field observations, were used to improve the accuracy of tree species classification. Finally, Simpson's diversity index for forest tree species, was calculated and mapped, constituting a relative indicator for biodiversity for forest ecosystem organisms (fungi, insects, birds, reptiles, mammals) and carrying implications for the identification of patches prone to disturbance or that should be prioritized for conservation.

Seventeen localities were studied. All meadow biotopes were divided into four types: dry meadows, dry meadows adjacent to forest shelter-belts, wet floodplain meadows, and floodplain meadows affected by livestock grazing. The highest species diversity was in dry meadows adjacent to forest shelter-belts (65 species) and wet floodplain meadows (62 species). The lowest number of species was in floodplain meadows affected by livestock grazing (24 species). Forty ground beetle species have been identified in dry meadows. Wet floodplain meadows had the highest Shannon's index, and the lowest Simpson index. The ground beetle fauna had high values of the Simpson and Berger-Parker indices in dry meadows. Only two species dominated in dry meadows, while four to seven species dominated in other habitats. According to the Jaccard similarity index, the most similar species composition of ground beetles was in dry meadows and dry meadows adjacent to forest shelter-belts. By reducing the number of species and specimens of ground beetles, trampling has a great effect on the fauna of floodplain meadows affected by livestock grazing.

The factors underpinning variation in the structure of the equine strongyle community remain unknown.Methods Using horse-based strongyle community data collected after horse deworming (48 horses in Poland, 197 horses in Ukraine), we regressed species richness and the Gini-Simpson index upon the horse's age, faecal egg count, sex and operation of origin. Using the Ukrainian observations, we applied a hierarchical diversity partitioning framework to estimate how communities were remodelled across operations, age groups and horses. Lastly, strongyle species counts collected after necropsy (46 horses in France, 150 in Australia) were considered for analysis of their co-occurrences across intestinal compartments using a joint species distribution modelling approach.Results First, inter-operation variation accounted for > 45% of the variance in species richness or the Gini-Simpson index (which relates to species dominance in communities). Species richness decreased with horse's age (P = 0.01) and showed a mild increase with parasite egg excretion (P < 0.1), but the Gini-Simpson index was neither associated with parasite egg excretion (P = 0.8) nor with horse age (P = 0.37). Second, within-host diversity represented half of the overall diversity across Ukrainian operations. While this is expected to erase species diversity across communities, community dissimilarity between horse age classes was the second most important contributor to overall diversity (25.8%). Third, analysis of species abundance data quantified at necropsy defined a network of positive co-occurrences between the four most prevalent strongyle genera. This pattern was common to necropsies performed in France and Australia.Conclusions Taken together, these results show a pattern of beta-diversity maintenance across age classes combined with positive co-occurrences that might be grounded by priority effects between the major species.

In each village from July to September 2017, 60 sticky traps and 2 CDC light traps were laid. Spearman and Mann-Whitney tests were used to determine the relationship between the incidence of ZCL and the abundance of different species of sand flies. Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, Evenness, and Margalef indices were calculated to estimate the diversity of species. A total of 5,295 phlebotomine sand flies were collected, comprising 10 species of the genus Phlebotomus (3,947 flies) and 7 species of genus Sergentomyia (1,248 flies). The abundance of sand flies and incidence of ZCL in plain areas were greater than that of hillsides areas (P = 0.013, P = 0.002). There was a significant correlation between the incidence of ZCL and the abundance of Phlebotomus papatasi (P= 0.72, P = 0.004) and P. caucasicus groups (P= 0.006; 0.022). In the Shannon-Wiener index, the rest of the biodiversity indices were reduced in higher-altitude areas. Increasing Shannon-Wiener index showed higher diversity of sand flies in higher-altitude areas. Data of the reported cases of leishmaniasis in plain areas can reveal the relationship between less diversity index (Shannon-Wiener), higher dominant diversity index (Simpson), and incidence of leishmaniasis in these areas.																			0022-2585	1938-2928				NOV	2020	57	6					1768	1774		10.1093/jme/tjaa114	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjaa114								32700734					WOS:000593381800010

Of the total, Pectobacterium wasabiae (Pw) and P. carotovorum subsp. brasiliense (Pcb) comprised 88% (Pw: 94 isolates, Pcb: 98 isolates) of the isolates and Dickeya dianthicola (Ddi) 12% (27 isolates). P. atrosepticum (Pa) was not detected. Genetic diversity of Pw, Pcb and Ddi was investigated using repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) fingerprinting with three primer pairs complementary to repetitive sequences in the bacterial genome (BOX, ERIC and REP). One hundred and twenty-one Pw isolates, one hundred Pcb isolates and thirty-three Ddi isolates were assigned to twenty-nine, twenty-one and eleven fingerprint genotypes (FGs) based on the combination of fingerprint patterns for each rep-PCR experiment (BOX-, ERIC- and REP-PCR). The genetic diversity of Pw and Ddi isolates in Japan was considered high, with Simpson's diversity index and Shannon's index of 0.87 and 2.44 for Pw, and 0.84 and 2.05 for Ddi, respectively. Pcb isolates were less diversified genetically (diversity index: 0.57 and 1.58). The FGs of the isolates obtained from blackleg-affected potato plants in the seed tuber field agreed with those of the isolates in the field where the seeds produced were grown. These results support the occurrence of seed-borne transmission of the blackleg pathogen between the fields.																			0929-1873	1573-8469				2021 APR	2021	159	4					917	939		10.1007/s10658-021-02216-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10658-021-02216-9		FEB 2021											WOS:000618144200003

SMALL RUMINANT RESEARCH												Although previous research has shown that several health disorders affect gastrointestinal microbiome flora, there is no consensus on the relationship between gastrointestinal microorganism diversity and ruminant health. Therefore, we revealed how intestinal bacterial flora diversity affects the overall health of sheep (Ovis aries) from multiple perspectives. We gathered total 17 data on behaviour (time allocation and action intensity on a 3dimensional axis), nutrition (blood parameters, body condition), physical attributes, and resistance to parasitic infection (blood parameters, blood cell components, and eggs per gram [EPG] counts) from 20 sheep-both housed and grazing-at a Japanese farm. We defined an abnormal individual as one out of the normal range for blood parameters and the confidence interval among the 20 sheep in each behaviour. The species composition and diversity of intestinal bacteria in each sheep were determined by 1) extracting DNA from collected faeces, 2) identifying the species based on genetic approaches, and 3) calculating the diversity index using species composition at the phylum and genus levels. The calculated diversity indices were compared with those of the sheep group classified by the sum of abnormal measurements. The Shannon and Simpson diversity indices at the phylum and genus levels were 1.69 and 4.47 and 0.55 and 0.93, respectively. The sum of abnormal health measurements in each sheep ranged from 4 to 7, including mainly blood biological properties. Healthy sheep with lower total numbers of abnormal measurements tended to have higher Simpson lambda (p = 0.095) and Shannon-Weiner H ' indices (p = 0.085) of intestinal microbiota at the genus level. Therefore, it can be considered that the higher the diversity of intestinal microbiota at the genus level, the more functional species (working in the intestine in absorption, ingestion, immunity, and physiologically) would coexist, playing a role in overall ruminant health.																			0921-4488	1879-0941				2023 NOV	2023	228								107107	10.1016/j.smallrumres.2023.107107	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.smallrumres.2023.107107		OCT 2023											WOS:001101515500001

The calculated values of diversity indices showed that from Kotli, lowest diversity was calculated from Sensah and Dongi and highest diversity was calculated from Fateh Pur, Khuiretta and Holar. From Mirpur, the lowest diversity was calculated from Khari Sharif and Mangla where as the highest diversity was calculated from Mirpur city and Islam Garh. From Bhimber, the lowest diversity was calculated from Bernala, Kot Jamel and Kadala, where as the highest diversity was calculated from Chumb, Berhing and Choki.

A total of 30 different fungal endophytes were isolated from all the plant tissues which were authenticated by molecular identification based on rDNA ITS sequence analysis (ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 regions). The Menhinick's index revealed that the buds were immensely rich in fungal species, and Camargo's index showed the highest tissue-specific fungal dominance for the twigs. The most dominant species was Penicillium copticola that could be isolated from the twigs, leaves, and apical and lateral buds. A detailed calculation of Fisher's log series index, Shannon diversity index, Simpson's index, Simpson's diversity index, and Margalef's richness revealed moderate overall biodiversity of C. sativa endophytes distributed among its tissues. The fungal endophytes were challenged by two host phytopathogens, Botrytis cinerea and Trichothecium roseum, devising a dual culture antagonistic assay on five different media. We observed 11 distinct types of pathogen inhibition encompassing a variable degree of antagonism (%) on changing the media. This revealed the potential chemodiversity of the isolated fungal endophytes not only as promising resources of biocontrol agents against the known and emerging phytopathogens of Cannabis plants, but also as sustainable resources of biologically active and defensive secondary metabolites.

Tree-level diversity tested using a new method	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Concern about forestry practices creating tree-level monoculture plantations exists. Our study investigates tree diversity responses for six early seral boreal forest plantations in Ontario, Canada, representing three conifer species; black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana), 14 release treatments, and 94 experimental units. Dominance-diversity curves and Simpson's indices of diversity and evenness indicate tree alpha diversity. We propose a new method for assessing diversity, using percentage of theoretical species maximum (%TSM) which is determined by comparing post-disturbance richness (S) with a theoretical species maximum (TSM). Our results support the hypothesis that alternative vegetation release treatments generally do not reduce tree species diversity levels (%TSM) relative to untreated plots. The only %TSM (P <= 0.05) comparison that produced less diversity than in control plots was repeated annual treatments of Vision herbicide at one of the black spruce study sites. Our results generally support the hypothesis that tree monocultures do not develop after vegetation release. Only one out of 94 experimental units developed into a tree layer monoculture (Simpson's reciprocal diversity index = 1). Again this was one of the repeated annual treatments of Vision herbicide at one of the black spruce study sites-a treatment which is atypical of Canadian forest management.

Most of the rhizospheric microbial diversity studies are restricted to bacteria. In natural ecosystem, archaea also constitutes a major component of the microbial population. However, their diversity is less known compared to bacteria. Experiments were carried out to examine diversity of bacteria and archaea in the rhizosphere of bioenergy crop Jatropha curcas (J. curcas). Samples were collected from three locations varying widely in the soil physico-chemical properties. Diversity was estimated by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) targeting 16S rRNA gene of bacteria and archaea. Fifteen bacterial and 17 archaeal terminal restriction fragments (TRFs) were retrieved from J. curcas rhizosphere. Bacterial indicative TRFs were Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Verrumicrobiaceae, and Chlroflexi. Major archaeal TRFs were crenarchaeota, and euryarchaeota. In case of bacteria, relative fluorescence was low for TRF160 and high for TRF51, TRF 420. Similarly, for archaea relative fluorescence of TRF 218, and TRF 282 was low and high for TRF 278, TRF468 and TRF93. Principal component analysis (PCA) of bacterial TRFs designated PC 1 with 46.83% of variation and PC2 with 31.07% variation. Archaeal TRFs designated 90.94% of variation by PC1 and 9.05% by PC2. Simpson index varied from 0.530 to 0.880 and Shannon index from 1.462 to 3.139 for bacteria. For archaea, Simpson index varied from 0.855 to 0.897 and Shannon index varied from 3.027 to 3.155. Study concluded that rhizosphere of J. curcas constituted of diverse set of both bacteria and archaea, which might have promising plant growth promoting activities.

Understory biodiversity in tropical rainforests is important for the natural regeneration potential, which is critical for improving the overall function of forest ecosystem. We investigated the effects on plant species diversity (separated in shrubs, interlayer plants and herbs) and soil physical and chemical properties at five levels of stand density (5000, 6500, 8000, 9500, and 11000 trees.ha(-1)) in tropical rainforests on the Hainan Island, China. The results showed that soil water content increased with stand density, while organic matter content and both total and available phosphorus content was highest in the moderately dense stand. There was no effect of stand density on the diversity of interlayer plant species (climbing vines). The diversity of the interlayer was consistently greater than herbs, especially at high stand density. Diversity of herbs was lowest in the high-density stand (11000 trees.ha(-1)). Species richness and Simpson's index of dominance of the shrub layer and species richness and its Shannon-Wiener diversity index of the herb layer were both highest at moderate stand density (8000 trees.ha(-1)). Species richness and Shannon-Wiener diversity index of interlayer plants peaked at higher stand density (9500 trees.ha(-1)), and the Simpson dominance index generally increased with stand density, indicating that climbers are more competitive in denser tropical rainforests. Stand density influenced the diversity and composition of understory species. We found positive correlations for understory plant species diversity with soil water content, organic matter content, total phosphorus, and available phosphorus content. Our results indicate that moderate stand densities of 8000-9500 trees.ha(-1) seem optimal for enhancing understory species diversity, soil fertility, stand stability, and natural regeneration. It could be used as target density for managing secondary tropical lowland rainforests.

Does the exclusion of meiofauna affect the estimation of biotic indices using stream invertebrates?	AFRICAN ZOOLOGY												Biomonitoring of rivers is usually undertaken using information based on macroinvertebrate assemblages. However, exclusion of meiofauna (i.e. invertebrates less than 0.5 mm in size) when sorting benthic invertebrates can affect the estimation of densities and other biotic indices. In the present study, the effect of excluding the less than 0.5 mm fraction of invertebrates on estimation of benthic invertebrate indices was investigated in the Naro Moru River, Kenya. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou's evenness index, a multimetric index, Simpson's diversity index, Margalef's diversity index, mean invertebrate density, taxa richness, and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) densities were determined. Only mean invertebrate and EPT densities differed significantly between the greater than 0.5 mm and total fractions. In conclusion, exclusion of meiofauna from invertebrate samples can affect the estimation of some stream invertebrate biotic indices.																			1562-7020	2224-073X					2016	51	2					91	97		10.1080/15627020.2016.1196120	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15627020.2016.1196120													WOS:000382558100003
J	Schlapfer, F; Fischer, M				Schlapfer, F; Fischer, M			An isozyme study of clone diversity and relative importance of sexual and vegetative recruitment in the grass Brachypodium pinnatum	ECOGRAPHY												We asked whether differences in abundance and seed production of Brachypodium pinnatum after 16 yr of four different experimental land use regimes were reflected in differences in vegetative dispersal distance, clone diversity, clone area, and the proportions of sexual and vegetative recruitment. Mean vegetative dispersal distance was 5.5 mm yr(-1). Electrophoresis of 5 polymorphic isozyme loci of 20 tillers sampled at defined positions in each of twelve 1 x 6 m sampling areas (3 per treatment) revealed considerable clonal diversity. Per sampling area we found on avarage 9.98 enzyme phenotypes (clones), mean Simpson index was 0.825, and mean Shannon index 0.801. The mean ratio of sexual vs vegetative recruitment was about 1:32 000. Despite this low ratio, clonal diversity within the population of B. pinnatum was higher than reported for other clonal plant populations, possibly because of its high ramet densities. Mean clone area was 5.73 m(2), i.e. mean clone radius was 1.35 m. None of the 10 pairwise correlations between abundance and seed production on the one hand, and number of clones per plot sample, plot Simpson index, plot Shannon index, ratio of vegetative vs sexual recruitment, and clone area on the other, was significant. Mean clone radius was 245 times larger than the mean distance of yearly vegetative dispersal which suggests old ages and low turnover rates of clones. The time scale of the inert response of clonal diversity of B. pinnatum to changes in land use appears to largely exceed the experimental period of 16 yr.

This study aims to explore diatom diversity patterns and underlying driving forces in Sphagnum peatlands of central and northeastern China. A total of 200 diatom species were observed in 138 living Sphagnum samples collected from 8 peatlands in northeastern and central China, suggesting that diatoms are more prevalent in these limno-terrestrial environments than generally considered. The Simpson index was negatively correlated with dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in central China, while it was negatively correlated with water table depth (WTD) in northeastern China. Distance-decay rate of diatom community similarity was faster in central China than in northeastern China, probably due to strong dispersal limitation in these enclosed montane peatlands of central China. For diatom composition in the two regions, the pure effect of environmental variables explained more variance than that of regional climate or spatial factors, suggesting that niche-based processes primarily determined diatom composition in these peatlands. Our results highlight the importance of WTD and DOC in constraining diatom diversity patterns in Sphagnum peatlands.

In order to establish a theoretical basis for moso bamboo forest sustainable management, three types of moso bamboo forests with many years not weeding, hilltops weeding and herbicides weeding were choosed. And species names, numbers and coverages of all arbors, shrubs, herbs and vines were recorded in every quadrat. Species composition and alpha-diversity were analyzed to compare understory vegetation under the three types of moso bamboo forests with consistent stand structure and site conditions. There are four major findings in this study: (1) 74 species belonged to 47 families and 58 generas which are recorded in the three types of moso bamboo forests. Many years not weeding, hilltops weeding and herbicides weeding are respectively 33 families 39 genera 40 species, 33 families 37 genera 41 species and 37 families 43 genera 49 species. (2) Dominant species of arbors and shrubs within hilltops weeding and herbicides weeding moso bamboo forests are less than the ones of many years not weeding moso bamboo forest, whereas dominant species of herbs increased. Meanwhile, co-dominant specie of arbors is Cunninghamia lanceolata, shrubs is Rubus reflexus, and herbs are Melastoma dodecandrum and Dicranopteris dichotoma. (3) Richness of herbicides weeding and hilltops weeding moso bamboo forests is significantly lower than (p<0.05) the one of many years not weeding moso bamboo forest, and Containing absolute abundance diversity index (I) of hilltops weeding moso bamboo forest is also significantly lower than (p<0.01) many years not weeding moso bamboo forest. The differences of Simpson dominance index (C), Simpson diversity index (D),Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) and Pielou evenness index (J) among the three types of moso bamboo forests are not significant. Considering understory plant diversity and system structure stability analysis, anthropogenic hilltops weeding measure is suggested to be used for understory vegetation interference.																			1022-6680		978-3-03785-742-7				2013	726-731						4288	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.4288	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMR.726-731.4288													WOS:000333767501342
J	Jung, V; Morel, L; Bonthoux, S; Chollet, S				Jung, Vincent; Morel, Lois; Bonthoux, Sebastien; Chollet, Simon			Integrating species pools and abundance distribution in habitat conservation status assessment: A new index	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Habitat degradation and fragmentation are recognized as major causes of biodiversity loss, and effective management to conserve habitats is highly dependent on our ability to assess their conservation status. In this study we introduce a new index (VCS, for vegetation conservation status) to assess the conservation status of plant communities, which reflect the identity of habitat types. The VCS index is based on the same probabilistic approach than the classical Simpson's diversity index, but uses the concept of species pools to integrate the influence of 'typical' and Mon-typical' species on habitat conservation status. In addition to the effect of species identity, this index also allows the detection of change in conservation status because of variation in speciesabundance distribution. As an example we applied the VCS index to two heathland habitats in French Brittany and we compared the values provided by the index to qualitative assessments by heathland experts. We also compared the performance of the VCS index against three other indices: species richness, species diversity and a more recent index of 'favourable conservation status'. Among the four indices tested, the VCS index was the most effective in assessing the vegetation conservation status when compared against qualitative assessment by heathland experts. Moreover the VCS index, coupled with variance partitioning methods, allowed to quantify the contribution of expected causes of habitat degradation. This study demonstrates that the use of habitat-specific species pools to distinguish between typical and non-typical species, as well as the consideration of species abundances, are critical for an accurate assessment of the vegetation conservation status. The VCS index should therefore be a valuable tool for both managers and researchers involved in habitat conservation.

The mussel beds are located on intertidal sand bars in the mouth of two Danish fjords with similar hydrographical conditions. We test the hypothesis that species diversity, abundance and distribution of the associated fauna at spatial scales of mussel patches is an effect of patch size irrespective of location and position within a patch. A statistical analysis using a hierarchical nested three-factorial ANOVA was performed on numbers of individuals, number of species and numbers in certain higher taxa. Furthermore, comparisons of diversity by using Jackknife estimates of species richness/evenness and the non-parametric Simpson's Index of Diversity were made. The results showed that effects of patch size and position within a patch were inconsistent but differences between stations were pronounced. The fauna at both sites was dominated by mobile species and primary colonizers. The difference in composition between locations indicated higher organic enrichment at Kerteminde. The use of Jackknife estimates of species richness/evenness and Simpson's Index of Diversity was found to be insufficient to describe differences compared to the hierarchical nested ANOVA since the latter provides statistical tests and an estimate of the contribution of the variation at each scale.																			0078-5326					JUL	1996	45	1					39	53		10.1080/00785326.1996.10432461	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00785326.1996.10432461													WOS:A1996UY42500003

Not surprisingly, many methods have been developed for defining and comparing community structure: species richness, diversity indices, similarity indices, biotic indices. Most were developed for use in detecting environmental stress in aquatic ecosystems, but many perform equally well for terrestrial communities. This brief review examines the most frequently used and/or useful of these methods in order to explore differing approaches to the problems of quantifying community structure and comparing one community with another. The species richness method, S, is discussed. Diversity indices surveyed include: Shannon's H', Simpson's D, Brillouin's H, McIntosh's M, Cairns' Sequential Comparison Index, SCI, Hurlbert's "encounter" Index, PIE, and, Keefe and Bergersen's TU. Five similarity indices are reviewed: Jaccard's Index, Percentage Similarity Index, PSC, Bray-Curtis Index, Euclidean (or "ecological") distance, and, Pinkham and Pearson's Index, B.

ECOSPHERE												Beta diversity (beta) is used in biogeography, ecology, and conservation to assess the heterogeneity of local communities. Ideally, researchers could include sensitivity to error in the list of reasons to choose a beta index. However, only numerical undersampling has been rigorously studied. This study compared multiple beta indices to determine which are most robust to geographic undersampling, numerical undersampling, and taxonomic error using simulated landscapes. For these landscapes, eight beta indices were chosen to represent families of beta and used to measure real and errant data. Six indices used both presence-absence and abundance data, while two more used only abundance data. Six of the abundance-based indices had adjusted versions for individual undersampling, and these versions were also evaluated (total = 14 indices). Presence-absence-and abundance-based indices were comparable in sensitivity to total method error. Numerical undersampling and taxonomic error generally caused more error in beta than randomly distributed geographic undersampling. Among presence-absence-based indices, Jaccard's dissimilarity was the most robust to error overall, while b-3 was the most robust among narrow-sense measures. Among abundance-based indices, Bray-Curtis and BDTOTAL were the most robust to error. Some commonly used beta indices (e.g., Sorensen, Simpson) are relatively unreliable given errors of taxonomy or numerical undersampling. Future studies of beta should focus on using more robust indices (Jaccard, Bray-Curtis, BDTOTAL), and past studies based on error-sensitive indices should be considered with caution. Studies of beta should emphasize adequate numerical sampling and taxonomic accuracy to minimize errors in beta.																			2150-8925					FEB	2018	9	2							e02100	10.1002/ecs2.2100	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecs2.2100													WOS:000427091200027

It explores the social forces driving religious diversity, including national histories, demographic trends, and government policies, as well as the relations between religious diversity and religiosity. It summarizes several conceptual approaches to this topic. Empirically, four measures of diversity are employed: the number of religions in each country; proportion of adherents in the largest faith; the Shannon index; and the Simpson index. These are mapped using both conventional choropleths and Dorling cartograms. The diversity measures show that China, India, Russia, Japan, and Indonesia are among the world's most religiously diverse states, and contrary to received wisdom, are more diverse than the USA, which is often regarded as the most diverse in the world.																			1464-9365	1470-1197				AUG	2007	8	4					597	613		10.1080/14649360701529857	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649360701529857													WOS:000250270500005

J	Camargo, JA				Camargo, Julio A.			The Lorenz curve: a suitable framework to define satisfactory indices of landscape composition	LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY												Context Patch diversity, evenness and dominance are important metrics of landscape composition. They have been traditionally measured using indices based on Shannon's information entropy (H) and Simpson's concentration statistic (lambda). Objectives The main objectives of this study are: (1) to show that the Lorenz curve is an appropriate framework to understand and measure patch dominance, evenness and diversity; (2) to show that Lorenz-compatible indices have better mathematical behavior than H-based and lambda-based indices. Methods Thirteen different hypothetical landscapes were created to assess landscape composition with the Lorenz curve and to compare the mathematical behavior of Lorenz-compatible indices with that of H-based and lambda-based indices. Results The Lorenz curve is a suitable framework to understand and measure patch dominance, evenness and diversity due to four relevant equivalences: (1) patch dominance = the separation of the Lorenz curve from the 45-degree line of perfect patch evenness; (2) patch evenness = 1 - patch dominance; (3) patch diversity (eliminated by patch dominance) = patch richness x patch dominance; (4) patch diversity (preserved by patch evenness) = patch richness x patch evenness. Accordingly, patch diversity/patch richness = 1 - patch dominance and land-cover concentration = 1/patch diversity. Conclusions Lorenz-compatible indices have better mathematical behavior than H-based and lambda-based indices, exhibiting greater coherence and objectivity when measuring patch dominance, evenness and diversity.																			0921-2973	1572-9761				2019 DEC	2019	34	12					2735	2742		10.1007/s10980-019-00926-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10980-019-00926-4		OCT 2019											WOS:000493339200001

J	Roy, S				Roy, Suparna			Seaweed diversity within intertidal zone of Olaikuda and Vadakkadu, Rameshwaram, southeast coast of India	HELIYON												Seasonal variation of seaweed diversity was studied in Olaikuda and Vadakkadu, the two unexplored coastal areas in Rameshwaram Island in south coast of India. An extensive survey on seasonal changes of seaweed diversity was made study and the data were analyzed for different diversity indices. In each location, 3 transects at 100 m gap were taken and in each transect 10 quadrates, a total of 30 quadrates were taken for seaweeds diversity. The diversity data were analyzed with statistical methods such as graphical and statistical analysis K-dominance curve with software PRIMER package, cluster analysis, multivariate methods, anosim and diversity indices such as Shannon Weaver diversity index, Simpson species richness index, Fisher alpha index, Pielou's evenness, and taxonomic species diversity (delta) index were analyzed by using the software R statistic version 3.1.4. Package (vegan). Totally 74 species including 28 species of Chlorophyceae, 18 species of Phaeophyceae and 28 species of Rhodophyceae were recorded. The study areas are flourishing with 49-59 seaweed species. It is inferred that the seaweeds are well diversified seasonally except summer. The baseline data generated in this work will help in conservation of the seaweeds in the areas.																				2405-8440				JUL	2020	6	7							e04585	10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04585	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e04585								32775733					WOS:000558740400022
J	Yang, H; Song, JC; Hou, QQ; Yu, XJ				Yang, Hang; Song, Jianchao; Hou, Qingqing; Yu, Xiaojun			Response of soil microbial α-diversity to grazing in grassland ecosystems: A meta-analysis	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												Grazing is one of the most important forms of terrestrial use, and the soil microbial community plays an important role in nutrient cycling and biodiversity maintenance of grazing grassland, but the response of soil bacterial and fungal communities alpha-diversity to grazing and the potential mechanisms of grazing-induced soil microbial change have not been well synthesized. We conducted a meta-analysis of 87 pairs of globally distributed observations from 35 published papers to investigate the response of the soil microbial community to grazing and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that light grazing increased the soil bacterial community Shannon index by 2.4%, but the soil fungal Shannon index decreased by 21.4%. Yak (Bos grunniens) grazing significantly increased the soil bacterial and fungal Shannon index by 1.5% and 11.3%, respectively. Grazing duration of 5-10 years increased the soil bacterial Chao1 index by 9.1% and fungal Chao1 and evenness indexes by 11.3% and 30.4%, respectively. In areas with <400 mm of precipitation, grazing decreased the soil bacterial Simpson index, and in areas of >= 400 mm, grazing also reduced the soil bacterial Simpson and increased the fungal richness and evenness. A linear analysis between soil microbial alpha-diversity indexes and other related variables showed that soil bacterial and fungal communities alpha-diversity and abundance under grazing conditions were significantly and positively correlated with grassland vegetation, soil pH, soil water content (SWC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), organic carbon (SOC), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), suggesting that changes in microbial communities were the combined result of grazing-induced vegetation and soil changes. Our results revealed the effects of grazing on soil bacterial and fungal alpha-diversity and their underlying mechanisms, which provide a basis for advocating moderate grazing and studying grassland management practices.																			1085-3278	1099-145X				2024 JAN 30	2024	35	2					608	621		10.1002/ldr.4939	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ldr.4939		OCT 2023											WOS:001081493300001

Mood disturbance, but not overall diet quality, is associated with fecal microbiome diversity in free-living adults	NUTRITIONAL NEUROSCIENCE												ObjectivesTo investigate the gut-brain axis, we explored the relationships among mood disturbance (MD), diet quality (DQ), and fecal microbiota in free-living adults.MethodsA cross-sectional analysis was conducted with data from 75 healthy adults enrolled in two studies. Anthropometrics, 16s rRNA gene sequencing of fecal microbes, DQ as assessed by Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI), and MD determined by Profile of Mood States (POMS) were included. Alpha-diversity and DQ differences were explored between low (n = 37) and high MD (n = 38) groups. Spearman correlations were used to investigate relationships between alpha-diversity, DQ, and POMS subscales. Moderation analysis explored the effect of HEI score on the relationship between MD and alpha-diversity.ResultsParticipants were mostly white (67%), 54.5 years old (+/- 11.8), and overweight (28.5 +/- 6.5 kg/m(2)). Shannon and Simpson indices indicate higher alpha-diversity in participants with low MD compared to high MD (p = 0.004 and p = 0.008, respectively). Simpson and Shannon indices were correlated with subscale of anger (rho = -0.303, p = 0.011; rho = -0.265, p = 0.027, respectively)and total MD (rho = -0.404, p = 0.001; rho = -0.357, p = 0.002, respectively). Refined grains were associated with fatigue and tension subscales (rho = 0.428, p < 0.001; rho = 0.302, p = 0.014, respectively). DQ did not significantly moderate the relationship between alpha-diversity and mood disturbance (F(7, 53) = 2.00, p = 0.072, R-2 = 0.209). Shannon index was a significant predictor of MD (b = -4.39, t(53) = -2.55, p = 0.014), but total HEI score and the interaction (Shannon index*HEI score) were not significant.DiscussionGreater bacterial diversity was associated with lower MD, and DQ was associated with various mood state subscales in this sample of adults.

A total of 41 species belonging to 7 orders, 15 families and 29 genera were recorded with highest diversity during post-monsoon season compared to the pre-monsoon season and monsoon season. The fish abundance similarity between the monsoon and post-monsoon reached a maximum of 89%. Seasonal variations in the mean species abundance, Simpson dominance index, Shannon diversity index, Pielou's evenness index and Margalef's richness index were determined. One-way ANOVA revealed a significant difference (P < 0.05) at the temporal scale. There was a significant seasonal difference in species abundance (P = 0.0006) and evenness index (P = 0.02) among the diversity indices. During the study period, three 'vulnerable' species, three 'near threatened' species and two 'endangered' species were caught. Carnivore dominance was evident throughout the year in the trophic guild of fishes. The Pearson correlation test revealed that water pH, dissolved oxygen, sediment organic carbon and clay percentage were positively correlated to all four diversity indices. Simpson and Margalef species richness diversity indices were positively correlated to sediment pH. Fish abundance was positively associated with sediment pH, silt, phosphorus and nitrogen content. Canonical correspondence analysis was used to investigate the relationships between fish assemblages and environmental conditions. Among the 19 physicochemical parameters, nine (dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, conductivity, transparency, hardness, phosphate and chlorophyll-a, sediment nitrogen and phosphorus) characteristics were shown to be statistically significant (P < 0.05) in determining fish diversity. Dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, conductivity, transparency, hardness, phosphate and chlorophyll-a of water and sediment nitrogen and phosphorus qualities were the key factors for the species abundance. The reservoir boasts a diverse fish population that allows multi-species fishing and generates revenue for numerous local fishers. Fish habitats should be protected in order to maintain diversity and long-term ecological benefits.					; Abraham, Thangapalam Jawahar/F-7911-2013	Panda, Kamalesh/0000-0002-3802-6113; Abraham, Thangapalam Jawahar/0000-0003-0581-1307; Nagesh, Talagunda Srinivasan/0000-0002-6256-5029; DAS, SARITA KUMARI/0000-0003-2820-979X													1936-0584	1936-0592				2023 DEC	2023	16	8								10.1002/eco.2599	http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/eco.2599		NOV 2023											WOS:001103554900001

The data used in this study are reports of the laboratory diagnosis of virus infections made to the Public Health Laboratory Service Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre. Two indices of diversity were calculated from the data-Fisher's and Simpson's. Both indices were shown to correlate with latitude but not longitude. Possible mechanisms for this diversity gradient are discussed. It is suggested that such a gradient in the class of human viruses is more likely to be due to increasing environmental stress in colder climates, than to the after-effects of major climatic change.

J	Ricotta, C				Ricotta, C			Additive partition of parametric information and its associated β-diversity measure	ACTA BIOTHEORETICA												A desirable property of a diversity index is strict concavity. This implies that the pooled diversity of a given community sample is greater than or equal to but not less than the weighted mean of the diversity values of the constituting plots. For a strict concave diversity index, such as species richness S, Shannon's entropy H or Simpson's index 1-D, the pooled diversity of a given community sample can be partitioned into two non-negative, additive components: average within-plot diversity and between-plot diversity. As a result, species diversity can be summarized at various scales measuring all diversity components in the same units. Conversely, violation of strict concavity would imply the non-interpretable result of a negative diversity among community plots. In this paper, I apply this additive partition model generally adopted for traditional diversity measures to Aczel and Daroczy's generalized entropy of type alpha. In this way, a parametric measure of beta-diversity is derived as the ratio between the pooled sample diversity and the average within-plot diversity that represents the parametric analogue of Whittaker's beta-diversity for data on species relative abundances.

Particularly vulnerable habitats are freshwater ecosystems, which are hotspots of biodiversity. The threat to these ecosystems are cyanobacterial blooms, which tend to proliferate in the face of climate changes. Cyanobacteria development and dominance affect the whole food web, especially the zooplankton community. We used three classical biodiversity indexes (species richness, Simpson's Diversity Index and Shannon Diversity Index) and three functional diversity indexes (functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence) to study the impact of cyanobacterial bloom on the zooplankton community. The study was conducted in water bodies with a different period of bloom duration (short-lasting blooms vs. long-lasting blooms) in order to determine the impact of the proliferated blooms on the aquatic ecosystems. Use of functional diversity indexes allowed for identifying changes that can be overlooked by classical biodiversity indexes. We conclude that cyanobacterial bloom involves modifications of functional trait space of studied communities and, in consequence, functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

Calculating landscape diversity with alpha diversity indices	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												Aim: The fundamental information layers of ecosystem based management plans are obtained by calculating, modeling and mapping of biodiversity. This study was carried out to calculate and map of landscape diversity in the Kuyucak Mountain District, in the transition zone of the Mediterranean region. Methodology: Topographical diversity values of altitude, slope degree and radiation index for each cell (752.09 x 752.09 m) of Kuyucak Mountain District were calculated using Shannon Wiener, Simpson diversity, Renyi H-2 and Rao indices. The index for each variable topographic map, which was prepared using cellular values after the calculations was obtained by Geographic Information Systems. Results: The maps illustrating diversities of topographical variables were prepared in order to obtain more accurate model based distribution map of biodiversity. Interpretation: Climate, topography and soil properties play important roles on biodiversity. There are also significant relationships between landscape diversity and biodiversity. That is why it is important to prepare not only climatic, topographic and soil maps but also diversity maps as explanatory variables for modeling and mapping of biodiversity.

Two different monitoring approaches were used to assess macrofungal biodiversity in broadleaf Mediterranean forests in order to determine whether different sampling efforts can provide statistically similar diversity indices. Despite the different number of field visits, the results obtained show that some biodiversity indices (e.g. Shannon index, Eveness, Simpson index) values do not seem to be significantly affected by the survey approach chosen and a single survey per year has achieved comparable results to multiple surveys. This, in a wider biodiversity context it could produce a quick field methodology to study complex taxonomic groups, such as macrofungi.					feest, alan/B-5128-2008; Mariotti, Mauro/I-7301-2016	Cecchi, Grazia/0000-0003-4130-7749; Mariotti, Mauro/0000-0002-9595-4629													1470-160X	1872-7034				FEB	2018	85						1210	1230		10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.11.054	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2017.11.054													WOS:000430634500119

Diversity, distribution and vegetative structure of mangroves of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, India	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The present study was carried out to determine the diversity, distribution and vegetative structure of mangroves of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands (ANI). The results suggest that mangroves of the ANI consist of 38 mangrove species belonging to 12 families and 19 genera, which includes 4 hybrids and 34 species. In other words, about 50% of the global mangrove species are present in ANI. Andaman Islands have 35 species and Nicobar Islands have 21 mangrove species. The average tree density in ANI is 1746/per hectare and varies from 487 to 2383 per hectare. The Shannon diversity index for the whole ANI is 2.94 and Simpson index is 0.07. Family Rhizophoraceae constitutes an important vegetative component in the mangroves of the ANI followed by Acanthaceae, Lythraceae and Malvaceae. Rhizophora spp. constitutes 19% of the Important Value Index (IVI) and R. apiculata is dominant in ANI. Among the eight forest divisions, mangrove diversity is high in South Andaman (30 species) followed by Middle Andaman (28), Mayabunder (25), Diglipur (25), Nicobar (21), Little Andaman (20), Havelock (20) and Baratang (20). The average mangrove plant density and Shannon diversity index (H') is high in Middle Andaman (2101/hectare; H' = 2.93). Species richness index (d') is high in South Andaman (3.32). Evenness index (J') is high in Little Andaman (0.92). Simpson dominance index (D) ranged between 0.07-0.1, and this agrees with the high diversity in mangroves of ANI. In all the divisions Rhizophora spp. constitutes a major vegetative component except, Diglipur and Nicobar. In Diglipur Bruguiera spp. are dominant, while in Nicobar Sonneratia spp. are dominant. The low similarity value of the Nicobar division with other divisions indicates the difference in floristic structure of mangroves of the Andaman Islands and Nicobar Islands. The present study also indicates that mangrove of ANI are more diverse in its species composition than the other mangrove habitats in India.

There were 30 species of phytoplankton and 15 species of zooplankton. The average plankton population was 28,201- 2,18,229 units l(-1) in terms of phytoplankton and 952-11581 units l(-1) in terms of zooplankton throughout the study. Micmcystis spp. belonging to the group cyanophyceae was the most dominant among phytoplankton. The range of Shannon and Simpson diversity indices (2.006-2.947 and 0.8019-0.9215 respectively) indicate moderate diversity of plankton in these water bodies. The values of diversity indices indicate less disturbance level and medium productivity. Study of various physico-chemical and biological parameters revealed that these reservoirs have medium productivity and if managed properly, production at all the trophic levels can be enhanced.

However, some of the mechanisms behind large-scale patterns of species richness and abundance are expected to act on the community level, and on a smaller scale than the resolution of the data commonly used for deriving these patterns. We studied the distribution of sheetweb spiders (Araneae: Linyphiidae) across Europe using both standardised samples from local habitats and large-scale inventories. In the first approach, we analysed species and individual numbers from standardised pitfall traps from 17 locations distributed from northern Sweden to Spain and Greece. We also calculated Simpson indices to correct for different activity densities. Additionally, we analysed whether diversity of sheetweb spiders is sensitive to habitat type. In the second approach, we investigated the known sheetweb spider species richness of European countries and large islands. In both datasets, species richness of sheetweb spiders reached a maximum at about 55 degrees N and declined towards the Mediterranean and the Arctic. In addition, species richness decreased from western (maritime) to eastern (continental) regions. Also Simpson diversity showed a hump-shaped relation to latitude, and was the only variable influenced by habitat type. In contrast to species richness and diversity, activity density increased monotonously with latitude. Towards the north, sheetweb spiders are likely limited by energy availability, towards the south, water limitation as well as bottom-up and top-down community interactions may reduce sheetweb spiders. Accordingly, their diversity does not follow the pattern of vertebrates, large insects and aquatic organisms, which depend more strongly on energy availability. (C) 2009 Gesellschaft fur Okologie.

Forty AM species belonging to ten genera viz. Acaulospora, Claroideoglomus, Dentiscutata, Diversispora, Funneliformis, Gigaspora, Glomus, Redeckera, Scutellospora and Septoglomus were recorded indicating high level of AM richness in coconut rhizosphere. Of these, eighteen AM fungal species are being reported for first time from this palm. Claroideoglomus, Glomus and Gigaspora were the most commonly present genera and Claroideoglomus etunicatum and Glomus aggregatum the common species. The diversity indices (Shannon indices values) of AM fungi associated with coconut palm in a crop mixed system and mono crop varied significantly. The Shannon index, Simpson's index and evenness ranged from 1.40 +/- 0.10 to 2.70 +/- 0.01, 0.65 +/- 0.033 to 0.90 +/- 0.004, 0.51 +/- 0.01 to 0.82 +/- 0.01, respectively. Correlation between soil physio chemical characters and mycorrhizal parameters were worked out. Soil pH had negative correlation with spore count, root colonization, species richness, Shannon H and Simpson indices but had positive correlation with species evenness. Electrical conductivity showed positive correlation with root mycorrhizal colonization which indicated active AMF mediated uptake of nutrients.

Based on the near-mature secondary coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest in Jilin Province Forestry Experimental Zone, this study analyzed seasonal changes of species diversity and biomass of the understory herb layer after different intensities of thinning. Results The results showed that although the composition of herbaceous species and the ranking of importance values were affected by thinning intensity, they were mainly determined by seasonal changes. Across the entire growing season, the species with the highest importance values in thinning treatments included Carex pilosa, Aegopodium alpestre, Meehania urticifolia, and Filipendula palmata, which dominated the herb layer of the coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forest. The number of species, Margalef index, Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index all had their highest values in May, and gradually decreased with months. Pielou index was roughly inverted "N" throughout the growing season. Thinning did not increase the species diversity. Thinning can promote the total biomass, above- and below-ground biomass. The number of plants per unit area and coverage were related to the total biomass, above- and below-ground biomass. The average height had a significantly positive correlation with herb biomass in May but not in July. However, it exerted a significantly negative correlation with herb biomass in September. The biomass in the same month increased with increasing thinning intensity. Total herb biomass, above- and below-ground biomass showed positive correlations with Shannon-Winner index, Simpson index and Pielou evenness index in May. Conclusions Thinning mainly changed the light environment in the forest, which would improve the plant diversity and biomass of herb layer in a short time. And different thinning intensity had different effects on the diversity of understory herb layer. The findings provide theoretical basis and reference for reasonable thinning and tending in coniferous and broad-leaved mixed forests.

Their participation makes them functional bioindicators for determining agro-ecosystem stability. Yet, their abundance and diversity in some terrestrial ecosystems are still undisclosed. This work was done to determine the diversity of arthropod fauna in agro-ecosystem of District Faisalabad, Pakistan to compare and analyze the diversity, abundance, and richness of species in different ecological conditions. A total of 245 species belonging to 10 orders,70 families and 2741 specimens were collected from agro-ecosystem. The diversity parameters used to analyze the diversity of arthropods are Shannon index, Evenness Margalef index, Simpson index and Sorenson similarity index. More distantly it was observed that the most abundantly found orders were Orthoptera, Diptera, and Hemiptera. Orthoptera comprised 23.45%, Diptera 19.55%, Hemiptera 17.43%, Lepidoptera 11.30%, Hymenoptera 11.60%, Coleoptera 7.51%, Aranea 5.10%, Odonata 2.15%, Mantodea 0.94% and Neuroptera 0.91%. Morning fauna exhibit the highest Shannon diversity index (H=4.343) and Margalef index (D = 63.99) while the evening time showed the least Shannon diversity index (H=2.535) and Margalef index (D = 61.49). The arthropods abundance differed significantly in the morning and evening (p<0.05).

J	Jarvis, S				Jarvis, Scott			Capturing the Diversity in Lexical Diversity	LANGUAGE LEARNING												The range, variety, or diversity of words found in learners' language use is believed to reflect the complexity of their vocabulary knowledge as well as the level of their language proficiency. Many indices of lexical diversity have been proposed, most of which involve statistical relationships between types and tokens, and which ultimately reflect the rate of word repetition. These indices have generally been validated in accordance with how well they overcome sample-size effects and/or how well they predict language knowledge or behavior, rather than in accordance with how well they actually measure the construct of lexical diversity. In this article, I review developments that have taken place in lexical diversity research, and also describe obstacles that have prevented it from advancing further. I compare these developments with parallel research on biodiversity in the field of ecology, and show what language researchers can learn from ecology regarding the modeling and measurement of diversity as a multidimensional construct of compositional complexity.

The characterization of species diversity is based on the estimation of relative abundance of species and it is calculated in three separate analyses in which the data were partitioned as follows: (a) by decapod families (six in Colombia) (b) the unpartitioned dataset of all 139 Colombian species and (c) by the five biogeographic regions in the country. In each case, Campos & Isaza's species diversity index and the Shannon entropy index were calculated. The calculations performed here also allowed the identification of predominant species and those that are least represented in collections and might therefore be at greater risk of extinction.

The evaluation was carried out by comparing 10 plots with management history, which were measured before the application of the treatment and five years later. The diversity indices of Shannon, Simpson and Margalef were compared, as well as indices of structure of mixture of species, spatial distribution, and dimensional differentiation. According to the silvicultural treatments applied, the values of the indices do not present significant differences in their evaluations (p> 0.05), which indicates that forest use does not modify the diversity and structure of species of the tree stratum of this plant community.

In order to reveal the influence of alkali-saline on soil bacterial community in Songnen grassland, the composition and diversity of soil bacterial in different degrees of alkali-saline grassland were determined and analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that Soil bacterial community composition in Songnen grassland changed minuscule. Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Saccharibacteria were significantly correlated with pH value, which could be used as sensitive indicators of soil salinization in Songnen grassland. The increase of pH value had a significant induction effecton the alpha diversity of bacterial community (sobs, Shannon index, simpson index, ace index, chao index) (P < 0.05), and the alpha diversity were decrease with the increase of pH value.

The aim of this study was to characterize the structure of a disturbed forest of Pinus tropicalis in Galalon, Pinar del Rio. We carried out a floristic inventory, and determined the ecological importance value and the increased ecological importance index. The alpha diversity was calculated by means of the reciprocal of the Simpson index (1/D) and the Jackknife index. The beta diversity was estimated through the Morisita-Horn and Jaccard. The degree of interference of the area was evaluated by means of indicators of changes in the ecosystem. We identified 30 genera and 31 species from 22 families. The structural parameters indicated that the species of higher ecological importance were P. tropicalis, P. caribaea var. caribaea and Byrsonima crassifolia. The floristic diversity was low and the similarity indexes yielded three groups differing in floristic composition.

The result is as follows: in regions of different grazing systems the species of nematode were similar, while the total number of nematodes was significant. The non-plant-parasitic nematode dominance was in following sequence under different grazing systems: close > rotational grazing > free-choice grazing. The correlation of non-plant-parasitic nematode with plant community coverage and standing vegetation was significantly positive, while that of plant-parasite was significantly negative. The Shanmon diversity index, Simpson diversity index, Nutrition diversity index (T), FF/BF, non-plant-parasitic nematode dominance can be seen as the sensitivity index when the desert steppe is influenced by different grazing systems.																					978-7-5029-4291-5				2007							52	+																WOS:000251301500011

Therefore, four plant community structure types: arbor + herb (AH), shrub + herb (SH), arbor + shrub + herb (ASH), and herb (H), were selected as the research objects. A soil moisture sensor was used to monitor the soil moisture content in the 0-70 cm soil layer, to analyze the variation characteristics of soil moisture content and to explore the differences under different plant community structure types. The results indicate that: (1) A total of 31 plant species in 31 genera and 18 families were recorded, among which herbs were the most abundant. There were significant differences in diversity indexes for ASH and H. The differences between Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index of AH and H were significant, and between AH and SH in Pielou index and Simpson index were statistically significant. The Pielou index between SH and H was significantly different. (2) There were significant differences in soil water content among the four plant community types, showing SH > AH > H > ASH. The variation of soil moisture was consistent with the trend of rainfall, with the surface soil moisture more sensitive to rainfall events, and the deeper soil moisture had a lag. The Shannon-Wiener index was significantly and positively correlated with the Simpson index and the Margalef index. There was a highly significant positive correlation between Margalef index and Simpson index. The 20-30 cm soil layer was highly negatively correlated with the Margalef index and significantly and negatively correlated with the Shannon-Wiener index and the Simpson index. (3) The response of soil moisture of plant community structure types to light rain event was not obvious. The growth rates of soil water content in the 30-50 and 50-70 cm layers of the SH were higher in moderate rain event than that in heavy rain event, and H, AH, and ASH had larger growth rates in heavy rain events. The results provide a reference for the effective utilization of soil and water resources and the restoration of vegetation, as well as for plant community structure configuration decisions in the southern China karst region.

Most previous studies on the relationship between spectral and species diversity have focused on the development and use of spectral indices. However, commonly used species diversity indices may not be the best choice for spectral-species diversity research. In this paper, high spatial resolution multispectral images of freshwater marsh were obtained based on UAV in Sanjiang National Nature Reserve, Northeast China, and the commonly used species diversity indices (Richness, Shannon, and Gini-Simpson) and Hill numbers were calculated based on 135 quadrats information obtained from field surveys. The mean value of NDVI (NDVIMEAN), its standard deviation (NDVISD) and coefficient of variation (NDVICV) of each quadrat were calculated based on multispectral imagery as a proxy for the spectral indices of the quadrats. The univariate and multivariate linear models were employed to test the predictive ability of NDVI-related indices for commonly used species diversity indices and Hill numbers. The results showed that the predictive ability of NDVIMEAN for species diversity indices was limited, and the combined use of NDVIMEAN and NDVISD significantly improved the predictive ability of species diversity. The predictive ability of NDVI-related indices to Hill numbers is better than that of commonly used species diversity indices. Commonly used species diversity indices can only represent one or several "point" of the community species diversity, the Hill numbers provide a continuous measure of community species diversity, which can balance the inconsistency between the abundance and coverage of species in the community. Previous spectral-species diversity studies might not have shown the real predictive ability of species diversity based on NDVI-related indices. Our study provides innovative ideas for the selection of species diversity indices in future spectral-species diversity studies.					yunlong, yao/G-5259-2011														1470-160X	1872-7034				2022 SEP	2022	142								109233	10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109233	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2022.109233		JUL 2022											WOS:000874478300029

However, how to describe the diversity of traffic traces and the relationship between the traffic diversity and code coverage is still an issue. In this paper, the traffic diversity is defined using the number of packets and the size of the subnets involved, and traces having various diversity are used to evaluate the corresponding code coverage for the programs in a network device. Experiment results show that more number of packets or larger size of network segments can generate larger diversity indices and thus larger code coverage. For Snort, as the number of packets increases from 1 to 10,000,000, representative diversity index and the code coverage can increase from 0 to 0.95 on the basis of Simpson's index and from 19.1% to 32.2%, respectively. As the size of network segments increases, representative diversity index and the code coverage can increase from 0.41 to 0.82 and from 28.2% to 32.2%, respectively. Similar results can be obtained in the case of Linux kernel. If the mappings among different diversity indices and the corresponding code coverage can be built beforehand, the quality of the tests can improved.

J	Su, Q				Su, Qiang			Analyzing fractal property of species abundance distribution and diversity indexes	JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY												Community diversity is usually characterized by numerical indexes; however it indeed depends on the species abundance distribution (SAD). Diversity indexes and SAD are based on the same information but treating as separate themes. Ranking species abundance from largest to smallest, the decreasing pattern can give the information about the SAD. Frontier proposed such SAD might be a fractal structure, and first applied the Zipf-Mandelbrot model to the SAD study. However, this model fails to include the Zipf model, and also fails to ensure an integer rank. In this study, a fractal model of SAD was reconstructed, and tested with 104 community samples from 8 taxonomic groups. The results show that there was a good fit of the presented model. Fractal parameter (p) determines the SAD of a community. The ecological significance of p relates to the "dominance" of a community. The correlation between p and classical diversity indexes show that Shannon index decreases and Simpson index increases as p increases. The main purpose of this paper is not to compare with other SADs models; it simply provides a new interpretation of SAD model construction, and preliminarily integrates diversity indexes and SAD model into a broader perspective of community diversity.

Insect diversity, community composition and damage index on wild and cultivated murtilla	CIENCIA E INVESTIGACION AGRARIA												Plant domestication is a process in which plants' chemical defenses that help them cope with herbivores might decline. Consequences of this process could be reflected in an increase in insect pests. Therefore, we carried out a survey to contrast the diversity, damage indexes and insect assemblages between cultivated and wild "Murtilla" (Ugni molinae) plants. The main scientific question put forward in this paper is as follows: Is there a decrease in diversity and an increase in both insect assemblages and damage indexes associated with the domestication process in U. molinae plants? The objective of this report was to compare the structure of a taxonomic assemblage collected in both wild and cultivated plants and their temporal variation over the year. Seven ecotypes and their respective wild populations were selected for these studies. The results showed higher insect assemblages in wild parents (77.35%) vs. cultivated (22.7%). The damage indexes were also higher in wild plants (0.23). The diversity indexes according to Margalef (12.98), the Shannon index (5.15) and the Simpson index (19.04) were higher in wild plants. Moreover, approximately 60 species were determinate. We detected changes in insect assemblages, damage and diversity indexes that could suggest that murtilla domestication has altered insect assemblages.

This article describes how the rehabilitated mangroves evolved over 28 years and whether the ecological parameters of rehabilitated forest resembled those of the adjacent natural mangroves. This article presents species and structural composition data of rehabilitated and adjacent natural mangrove forests in the Trat Province of eastern Thailand. The species type, their girth at 1.3 m breast height, tree height, and the number of seedlings for each of the thirteen species, (Avicennia alba, Bruguiera cylindrica, Bruguiera gymnorrhiza, Bruguiera sexangula, Ceriops tagal, Excoecaria agallocha, Intsia bijuga, Lumnitzera littorea, Lumnitzera racemosa, Rhizophora apiculata, Rhizophora mucronata, Xylocarpus granatum, and Xylocarpus moluccensis), of the mangrove forests were collected. The data were collected in 10 x 10 m size plots from the seaward to landward end along with the stand age of the rehabilitated mangroves. The data was analysed using the Importance Value, Complexity Index, Simpson's Dominance Index of diversity and Simpson's Reciprocal, and Shannon-Weaver Index to distinguish various diversity and structural parameters using the mangrove forest structure and vegan: Community Ecology Package in R programming [2,3].

To detect the alteration of gut bacteria in children with ALL and analyse the impact of short-term-use of antibiotics on the changes caused by ALL. Methodology. We collected faecal samples from both children with ALL and healthy children. According to their medication history with antibiotics, we classified the samples into ALL+ATBx, ALL, CON+ATBx and CON groups. Next-generation sequencing was performed to identify the gut bacteria according to the MiSeq platform. The Shannon index, Simpson index, Chao index and Ace index were used to represent the alpha diversity of gut bacteria. The beta diversity was estimated using the principles of co-ordinate analysis and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling. The taxon composition and presence of biomarkers were then determined through bioinformatics. Results. With regard to alpha diversity, the Shannon index and Simpson index differed significantly between the ALL and CON groups, as well as the CON+ATBx and CON groups, but not the ALL+ATBx and CON+ATBx groups. With regard to beta diversity, the ALL and CON separated clearly into clusters, as did ALL+ATBx and CON+ATBx. There were differences in composition among the four groups at different taxonomy hierarchies. More bacteria showed an obvious difference between the paired groups ALL and CON than did for the paired groups ALL+ATBx and CON+ATBx. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves for Bacteroidales and Enterococcaceae used to predict ALL were 0.735 and 0.724, respectively. Conclusion. ALL induced structural changes of the gut microbiota, with the alpha diversity being significantly weakened by antibiotics, but not beta diversity. Bacteroidales and Enterococcaceae can be referred to as biomarkers for ALL.

Samples were gathered every two months, from five stations using a Surber sampler(30x30cm), fixed in formalin (4%) and then separated and identified in the laboratory. Environmental conditions (current velocity, temperature, depth, width, dissolve oxygen, conductivity, pH, alkalinity, Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and grain size) were measured. In addition, diversity and biotic indices were used to determine the water quality of the river. Results showed that 5 classes, 9 orders and 20 families were identified in this river. The families Hydropsychidae (Trichoptera), Simuliidae (Diptera) and Baetidae (Ephemeroptera) were dominant. Shannon-wiener and Simpson indices showed the highest diversity at station 1 and the lowest diversity in station 4. According to the Hilsenhoff, ASPT and BMWP indices, station 1 had good water quality for aquaculture.																			1562-2916						2017	16	3					1008	1020																WOS:000408236700012

A total of 106 bands ranging from 3 (for SCoT70) to 13 (for SCoT23) were observed. Of them, 33 (31%) bands were polymorphic with a mean of 1.65 bands per primer. Polymorphism information content (PIC) per primer ranged from 0.035 (for SCoT12) to 0.133 (for SCoT70), with an average of 0.078. Besides PIC, Simpson's diversity (D) index was also calculated for each SCoT marker as an indication of discrimination power across population. The D index was used to adjust the PIC of the SCoT markers. As the adjusted PIC (PICD=PICxD) was calculated based on both the PIC and the rate of band dispersion, this reflected the informativeness of a dominant marker more precisely than PIC. Genetic relationships were estimated using Jaccard's similarity coefficient-generated values between different pairs of genotypes that varied from 80 to 97% with an average of 88%. These coefficients were applied to construct a dendrogram using the UPGMA algorithm. A high genetic similarity was observed that might be due to the fact that N. sativa is a self-pollinated plant not originated from Iran and might have been imported from the Mediterranean regions.

INSIGHT TO THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF AMPHIBIANS AT MAJOR WETLANDS AND ASSOCIATED ECOSYSTEMS OF WESTERN GHATS FROM MAHARASHTRA, INDIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSERVATION SCIENCE												Present study was emphasized to reveal the comparative status of amphibian diversity at five major wetlands and their adjoining ecosystems from Ajara tahsil of Kolhapur district, Maharashtra, India. Diversity of amphibians was analyzed by using standard methods as prescribed by standard literature. In deep, diversity attributes like Whittekar's B - diversity, diversity indices such as Shannon (H), Simpson (1-D), Dominance (D) and Shannon's evenness indices; Individual rarefication curve and Renyi's Diversity Profile were estimated so as to compare diversity status among studied wetlands. The results of present investigation divulged that total 22 species of amphibians belonging to 17 genera and 7 families were recorded. On the basis of this Gavase and Dhanagarmola wetlands were found rich in the diversity. However, Statistical analysis revealed that Gavase and Dhanagamola wetlands have similar ecological conditions, hence, amphibian diversity status was noted similar to each other. On the other hand, due to high anthropological activities, Yarandol and Ningidage wetlands exhibited poor amphibian diversity. Comparatively, Khanapur wetland has an average diversity status.

With the objective of characterizing the agroforestry systems of the San Francisco enclosure of the El Anegado parish, a floristic inventory was carried out and information was collected on the use and management of the components of the farms, between February and March, 2022; Margalef, Simpson, Shannon and Pielou Equity diversity indices were calculated. Among the inventoried species, Coffea arabica L., Handroaunthus billbergii (Bureau & K. Schum.) S. O. Grose and Theobroma cacao L. stand out; while, Cedrela montana Moritz ex Turcz.; Cecropia maxima Snethl. and Handroanthus chrysanthus (Jacq.) SO Grose, are categorized as vulnerable. In the El Palmital farm, food use predominates (54.55%) and in La Fortuna, timber prevails (51.72 %). The diversity indices in both farms showed high, medium and low values, according to the Margalef, Simpson and Shannon indices, respectively. The largest use of land in El Palmital is the planted area 74.23% (1.80 ha) and in La Fortuna the non-agricultural area dominated 55.88 % (0.95 ha). The characterization of agroforestry systems provides a better view of them, by conducting inventories of species that reflect their importance, management and organization, allowing redesign and optimization of their operation.																			2310-3469					JAN-APR	2023	11	1							e772															WOS:000968224900001

This index is calculated on the basis of three landscape metrics: Simpson's Diversity Index, Interspersion Juxtaposition Index, and Shape Index. It presents landscape differentiation objectively with regards to local differentiation. It also characterises land cover spatial structure, reflecting area development and management. To provide functional interpretation of the index values, thresholds with the use of quantile division are determined. The SLDI index was computed for two communes neighbouring Warsaw, i.e. Blonie and Leszno. The results, presented in a form of choropleth map, could be used by local authorities as a tool for planning management at the level of commune. Moreover, it could be used for evaluating spatial development of a region showing area with low, medium and high landscape differentiation.

J	Hou, JW; Ye, M				Hou, Jiawen; Ye, Mao			Effects of Dynamic Changes of Soil Moisture and Salinity on Plant Community in the Bosten Lake Basin	SUSTAINABILITY												To estimate the potential risks of plant diversity reduction and soil salinization in the Bosten Lake Basin, the dynamic changes in the plant community and species diversity affected by soil moisture and salinity were analyzed from 2000 to 2020 based on remote sensing technology and field experiments. A model for simulating soil moisture, salinity, and the productivity of the plant communities was proposed. The results demonstrated that: (1) The soil moisture index (SMI) increased but the soil salinity index (SSI) decreased from 2000 to 2020 in the study areas. Accordingly, the plant community productivity indices, including the vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and ratio vegetation index (RVI), exhibited an increasing trend. It was found that the Alpine meadow, Alpine steppe, and temperate steppe desert were the main types of plant communities in the study areas, accounting for 69% of its total area. (2) With increasing SMI or decreasing SSI, the vegetation productivity such as NDVI, RVI, and EVI all exhibited an increasing trend. With the increment of SMI, the species diversity indices of the Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, and Margalef exhibited a distinctly increasing trend. However, the indices of the Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, and Alatalo increased with the decreasing SSI. (3) The study discovered from the SVM model that the species diversity index was optimal when the soil salinity was 0-15 g/kg and the soil moisture was 12-30% in the study areas. It was found that soil moisture, not soil salinity, controls the plant species diversity change in the study areas. (4) A multiple linear regression model was established for simulating the effect of soil water-salinity on the vegetation productivity index at the watershed scale. The model indicated that higher salinity would reduce vegetation productivity and higher soil moisture would promote vegetation growth (except for RVI). The SSI had a higher impact on NDVI and EVI than the SMI in the study areas. This study would support decision-making on grassland ecosystem restoration and management in the other arid areas.																				2071-1050				NOV	2022	14	21							14081	10.3390/su142114081	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su142114081													WOS:000884034500001

In this study, analysis of variations in groundwater components during artificial recharge revealed three stages at a text site in China. During stage I, total iron and dissolved organic carbon levels are stable basically, dissolved oxygen and SO42- levels have rising trends, NO3- curve varied not obviously. Variation curves show increases in dissolved oxygen, NO3-, SO42- and stabilization in dissolved organic carbon and total iron at stage II. During stage III, dissolved oxygen and NO3- have rising trends, dissolved organic carbon, total iron, and SO42- keep stable. At 25 and 70 days the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener indices show that microbial community richness and population diversity underwent a gradual dynamic change after recharge water arrived. Correlation analysis shows that the Simpson index was mainly affected by dissolved oxygen and NO3-. PCR-DGGE confirmed these findings. Overall, the results revealed that the main bacterial communities reduce total nitrogen, total phosphorous, and chemical oxygen demand, which corresponded to the calculated correlation index.					zhang, wenjing/AIE-7473-2022; Du, Shanghai/K-8691-2012; zhang, wenjing/AAE-7146-2019	zhang, wenjing/0000-0001-6263-5384; 													1866-6280	1866-6299				JAN	2016	75	1							84	10.1007/s12665-015-4959-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12665-015-4959-5													WOS:000370239800084

This study aimed to evaluate the spatial variability of biological diversity indices of soil fauna under different land (agriculture and forest). Samples were collected in seven areas (millet, soybean, corn, eucalyptus, pasture crops, and preserved and disturbed Cerrado), in Maranhao state, Brazil. The soil fauna was caught trapped in pitfall traps, installed 3 m away from each other. In each area, 130 traps were maintained for seven days. After this period, they were removed and their content transferred to bottles and taken to the laboratory, where the insects were screened and identified at the level of orders and families. Eight indices were calculated, namely: individuals trap(-1) day(-1), Jackknife richness estimator, the Simpson, McIntosh, Shannon, and total diversity, and Simpson dominance, and Pielou equitability indices. The spatial variability was derived from the semivariograms fitted to Gaussian, spherical, and exponential geostatistical models. Statistical analysis showed medium values of the coefficient of variation for millet, except for the indices individuals trap(-1) day(-1) and McIntosh diversity, which were considered high. The values of the correlation matrix were negative for some indices, suggesting an inverse relationship. For millet, corn, eucalyptus, disturbed Cerrado, and pasture areas, the Shannon diversity index exhibited a pure nugget effect. For the areas of millet, corn, disturbed Cerrado and pasture, the total diversity index was adjusted to the Gaussian model. The degree of spatial dependence was considered high for the individuals trap(-1) day(-1) and Pielou equitability indices for millet. Only for soybean and pasture similarity in the scaled semivariograms was observed for the spatial variability of the indices, indicating similarity of performance. Soil management and land use affect the patterns of soil fauna abundance, richness, and diversity. The presence of groups such as Araneae, Diplura, and Poduromorpha are related to ecological equilibrium, quality, and sustainability of the agricultural systems studied.

In contrast to the alpha diversity of stream fish assemblages, little concern has been reached regarding the factor affecting of spatial variation in beta diversity along longitudinal gradients, which may be modified by scale, indices of beta diversity and pairwise methods. To understand the spatial patterns and processes in the species composition of stream fish assemblages along the river continuum, we need to disentangle the influence of different beta diversity indices and pairwise methods on the longitudinal patterns of beta diversity. In this study, we chose four beta diversity indices (Jaccard, Sorensen, Simpson and additive partitioning) and two pairwise methods (mean beta diversity between the focal assemblage and all other assemblages; beta diversity between focal and immediate neighbouring assemblages downstream) to quantify the spatial pattern of fish beta diversity along the river continuum. We found that (1) although the four diversity indices differed in emphasis, they showed the same pattern of spatial variation in the longitudinal gradients of the river; (2) the same diversity index using different pairwise methods calculation may result in completely different spatial patterns; (3) beta diversity indices and pairwise may not have a significant effect on the ecological application of beta diversity, at least in community assembly. In conclusion, the results of our study suggest that at least in the longitudinal gradient of the river there may not be much difference in quantifying the spatial variation of beta diversity; however, pairwise methods between sampling sites need to be chosen according to specific research objectives.						yan, yun zhi/0000-0001-8088-3867													0906-6691	1600-0633				2022 APR	2022	31	2					260	269		10.1111/eff.12627	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eff.12627		AUG 2021											WOS:000681650000001

The biodiversity of soil seed bank and above-ground weed flora were investigated in spring cereals in organic and conventional farming system. The study was carried out between 2012 and 2014. Species of above-ground wild flora were counted on a surface of 1m(2) in the field. Soil for seed bank evaluation was taken from the field and evaluated by seedling emergence method in a greenhouse. There were no significant differences in number of species between two communities. Biodiversity of weed community, described by Shannon's diversity index and Simpson's dominance index, was significantly better maintained in the soil seed bank than in above-ground flora in both farming systems. A strong, positive correlation between the number of species, Shannon's diversity index, Simpson's dominance index of soil seed bank and above-ground weed species was found in both farming systems, while abundance of seeds and above-ground weeds was significantly, positively correlated only in the conventional farming system. Qualitative composition of weed flora depended more on the type of community (soil seed bank or above-ground weed communities) than the farming system.

It is the only kind of sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh which is surrounded by water bodies and most of the land covered with thatch grasses. The primary objective of the present study was to collect preliminary data on the insect diversity in this sanctuary. For this, the data were collected in four habitats viz. grassland, woodland, river bank and Jeep ghat camp area during February 04-07, 2015. The findings were analysed using Shannon index, Simpson index, Buzas and Gibson's evenness measure, Berger-Parker index and Fisher-alpha index. During the survey undertaken, 44 species of insects belonging to 10 orders and 25 families were documented. Lepidoptera represented by 9 species showed the highest species richness as per Shannon index followed by Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera represented by 6, 15, 5 and 4 species respectively. However, Simpson's diversity index calculated the highest species richness of Coleoptera followed by Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera. The maximum number of species inhabited in the grassland (22). Among the habitats studied, the highest species richness was found in woodland followed by riverbank, grassland and the camp area. Ceratosolen solmsi marchali was estimated as the most abundant insect species in camp area, Distoleon tetragrammicus and Schizodactylus monstrosus in riverbank, Globitermes globosus and Acrida bicolour in grassland and Mycalesis heri in woodland habitat. Though, it was a preliminary survey species like yellow winged grasshopper Gastrimargus musicus, sand dune cricket S. monstrosus and globoid nest termite G. globosus can be pictured as potential flagship insects in the sanctuary. Besides, it showed the variation of diversity in entomofauna among the habitats indicating habitat specific dependence of the insect assembly in the sanctuary.

Experiments carried out with lichen- and moss-dominated biocrusts indicate that climate change may dramatically reduce their cover and diversity. Therefore, the development of reproducible methods to monitor changes in biocrust diversity and abundance across multiple spatio-temporal scales is key for evaluating how climate change may impact biocrust communities and the myriad of ecosystem functions and services that rely on them. In this study, we collected lichen-dominated biocrust samples from a semi-arid ecosystem in central Spain. Their alpha-diversity was then evaluated using very high spatial resolution hyperspectral images (pixel size of 0.091 mm) measured in laboratory under controlled conditions. Support vector machines were used to map the biocrust composition. Traditional alpha-diversity metrics (i.e., species richness, Shannon's, Simpson's, and Pielou's indices) were calculated using lichen fractional cover data derived from their classifications in the hyperspectral imagery. Spectral diversity was calculated at different wavelength ranges as the coefficient of variation of different regions of the reflectance spectra of lichens and as the standard deviation of the continuum removal algorithm (SD_CR). The accuracy of the classifications of the images obtained was close to 100%. The results showed the best coefficient of determination (r(2) = 0.47) between SD_CR calculated at 680 nm and the alpha-diversity calculated as the Simpson's index, which includes species richness and their evenness. These findings indicate that this spectral diversity index could be used to track spatio-temporal changes in lichen-dominated biocrust communities. Thus, they are the first step to monitor alpha-diversity of biocrust-forming lichens at the ecosystem and regional levels, a key task for any program aiming to evaluate changes in biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in drylands.					de Guevara Sáez de Eguílaz, Mónica/AAQ-6778-2020; Maestre, Fernando T./A-6825-2008	de Guevara Sáez de Eguílaz, Mónica/0000-0003-2849-1801; Maestre, Fernando T./0000-0002-7434-4856														2072-4292				DEC 2	2019	11	24							2942	10.3390/rs11242942	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/rs11242942													WOS:000507333400058

The method was broadly conceived and included locating an objective index of diversity (Simpson's index), identifying the population of diverse materials available for selection by librarians, and selecting key variables that relate to high or low levels of diversity in individual libraries. Four potentially controversial subject areas were investigated, namely, abortion, capital punishment, disarmament or arms control, and euthanasia. Testing the method included analyzing questionnaires and library holdings of books and audiovisual materials, publishing and reviewing patterns, checklists from special interest groups, and regression analysis data related to creating models of significant independent variables that affect diversity scores of individual public libraries.

Regeneration diversity of Carex lasiocarpa community under different water levels was studied at two stages, recruitment and adult, in the Sanjiang Plain, Heilongjiang Province, China. The results showed that, at the two growing stages, important value of C. lasiocarpa population and species richness of the community decreased with the increasing water level, while the Simpson and Shannon-Wiener diversity indexes and Pielou evenness index increased. Under different water levels, community diversities were higher at the recruitment stage, while population important values of C lasiocarpa were higher at the adult stage. Indexes in vegetation evaluation must be chosen prudentially for successful restoration and effective management of wetlands, and especially for wetland restoration, the optimal time should be selected according to the restoration objectives and costs.

J	Fortin, MJ; Payette, S; Marineau, K				Fortin, MJ; Payette, S; Marineau, K			Spatial vegetation diversity index along a postfire successional gradient in the northern boreal forest	ECOSCIENCE												Boreal forest dynamics and biodiversity are mainly governed by natural disturbances such as fire. Because boreal forest communities are typically species-poor and composed predominantly of wide-ranging circumboreal species, all measurements of biodiversity using the most common species richness-based indices are likely to underestimate vegetation diversity at the stand level. To estimate vegetation diversity differences, we introduce a spatial diversity index (SDI), which accounts not only for species richness and species abundance, but also for the spatial occupancy of species, a neglected although important component of plant diversity. We tested the SDI along a postfire successional gradient of the lichen woodland zone in northern Quebec using eleven sites with different postfire ages, The SDI allowed us to statistically differentiate three species' spatial occupancy patterns. which correspond to three successional stages (pioneer, expansion and stabilization). In our study. we were unable to discriminate between these three successional structural phases using only Simpson and Shannon diversity indices. We conclude that indices based only upon species richness and species abundance may fail to differentiate vegetation diversity beta een sites in the boreal forest, whereas the spatial diversity index has succeeded because it incorporates species space occupancy.																			1195-6860	2376-7626					1999	6	2					204	213		10.1080/11956860.1999.11682521	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11956860.1999.11682521													WOS:000084000900009
J	Eliazar, II; Sokolov, IM				Eliazar, Iddo I.; Sokolov, Igor M.			Diversity of Poissonian populations	PHYSICAL REVIEW E												Populations represented by collections of points scattered randomly on the real line are ubiquitous in science and engineering. The statistical modeling of such populations leads naturally to Poissonian populations-Poisson processes on the real line with a distinguished maximal point. Poissonian populations are infinite objects underlying key issues in statistical physics, probability theory, and random fractals. Due to their infiniteness, measuring the diversity of Poissonian populations depends on the lower-bound cut-off applied. This research characterizes the classes of Poissonian populations whose diversities are invariant with respect to the cut-off level applied and establishes an elemental connection between these classes and extreme-value theory. The measures of diversity considered are variance and dispersion, Simpson's index and inverse participation ratio, Shannon's entropy and Renyi's entropy, and Gini's index.

Exotic invasive plants are putting a harm to the vegetation of Pakistan's Pothwar region, which is a biodiversity hotspot. In the current study, the effects of Broussonetia papyrifera, Parthenium hysterophorus, Xanthium strumarium, and Lantana camara on the local flora in the Pothwar area were examined. Two categorical groups (invaded and non-invaded) were used in a dichotomized experimental design to collect data. Using the software PRIMER-7 and IBM SPSS v. 21, different diversity indices including Margalef's index of species richness, Shannon index of diversity, and Simpson index of dominance were measured and compared between invaded and control plots. In comparison to the experimental plots, the control plots had an average of more individuals and diversity. On a multivariate scale, non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) and analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) revealed higher species richness in control plots. The invasion effect of L. camara was the highest, followed by X. strumarium, P. hysterophorus, and B. papyrifera.

Species-abundance and rarefaction curves were plotted for each system, and indices of diversity (Shannon-Wiener), dominance (Simpson), species evenness, and similarity (Jaccard) were calculated. The majority of hopper species and individuals belonged to the Cicadellidae family. A particular species dominated in each system: Graphocephala sp. (C), Fusigonalia lativittata (CP) and Hebralebra nicaraguensis (CPL). The richness and diversity of hopper species were highest in the CP system, followed by the CPL and C systems. Species similarity was closest between the CP and CPL systems, but varied considerably according to plant component and geographic location of each plot. Even though hoppers have not been reported as coffee pests in Mesoamerica, some of them cause serious problems elsewhere.

J	Glatthorn, J				Glatthorn, Jonas			A spatially explicit index for tree species or trait diversity at neighborhood and stand level	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Knowledge about tree species interactions is important for our understanding of forest ecosystems. Research about such interactions requires a quantitative description of different stand mixture types for example with measures of species- or trait-diversity like Simpson- or Rao-diversity. Many currently available diversity measures are based on relative proportions and do not account for the spatial configuration of a stand. They implicitly assume that all trees are equally likely to interact with one another, irrespective of their spatial distance. However, fundamental ecosystem processes such as competition are strongly influenced by intra- or interspecific interactions that take place between neighboring trees. This study introduces a measure for the neighborhood diversity (NDiv) around individual trees by averaging the dissimilarity between a tree and all its neighbors. NDiv uses maps of the 'area potentially available' to trees (APA) to define tree neighborhoods. APA-maps are derived by spatially dividing the entire stand area into adjacent patches that approximate the growing space that is potentially available to each tree. The average NDiv of all trees of a stand weighted by the sizes of their APA-patches provides a consistent diversity measure at standlevel. Depending on the used dissimilarity measure, NDiv may either quantify species or trait neighborhood diversity. Species neighborhood diversity and tree height neighborhood diversity of case-study plots were analyzed to demonstrate the application of NDiv. When tree locations were spatially randomized in a simulation study, NDiv of the case-study plots at standlevel was nearly identical to Simpson-diversity. However, the actually observed NDiv of plots with patch-wise mixing of tree species was considerably lower than their Simpson-diversity. On these plots, NDiv accounted for a limited potential for interactions among species since the tree species were growing spatially separated in patches. NDiv is a useful measure of tree diversity when trees are not randomly distributed across a stand and when mixing effects mainly derive from interactions between neighboring trees. The use of NDiv as explanatory variable may help to account for the spatial configuration of trees in forests which may increase the explanatory power of analyses of relationships between tree diversity and ecosystem processes.

J	Willis, AD; Martin, BD				Willis, Amy D.; Martin, Bryan D.			Estimating diversity in networked ecological communities	BIOSTATISTICS												Comparing ecological communities across environmental gradients can be challenging, especially when the number of different taxonomic groups in the communities is large. In this setting, community-level summaries called diversity indices are widely used to detect changes in the community ecology. However, estimation of diversity indices has received relatively little attention from the statistical community. The most common estimates of diversity are the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters of a multinomial model, even though the multinomial model implies strict assumptions about the sampling mechanism. In particular, the multinomial model prohibits ecological networks, where taxa positively and negatively co-occur. In this article, we leverage models from the compositional data literature that explicitly account for co-occurrence networks and use them to estimate diversity. Instead of proposing new diversity indices, we estimate popular diversity indices under these models. While the methodology is general, we illustrate the approach for the estimation of the Shannon, Simpson, Bray-Curtis, and Euclidean diversity indices. We contrast our method to multinomial, low-rank, and nonparametric methods for estimating diversity indices. Under simulation, we find that the greatest gains of the method are in strongly networked communities with many taxa. Therefore, to illustrate the method, we analyze the microbiome of seafloor basalts based on a 16S amplicon sequencing dataset with 1425 taxa and 12 communities.																			1465-4644	1468-4357				JAN	2022	23	1					207	222		10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa015	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/biostatistics/kxaa015								32432696					WOS:000743497700011

Is the above-ground biomass in natural temperate forests positively correlated with tree species diversity? 2. Is this biomass related to the diversity of tree functional Groups? Location: We used published data from over 100 permanent plots located in natural temperate forests in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia. Methods: We related the number of tree species and Simpson's index of tree species diversity to the above-ground biomass in natural forest stands, and we repeated the same calculations for the identification of functional groups of trees using PCA analysis of functional traits. Results: Analysed sites ranged from almost pure subalpine spruce stands to mixed deciduous lowland forests with eight tree species per stand. The above-ground biomass accumulation ranged from 169 to 536 tons of dry mass per hectare. For the analysed data set the relationship between tree species diversity and biomass accumulation was not significant but showed a negative trend. Similar results were obtained in analyses employing tree functional groups instead of tree species. A significant negative relationship was found after four stands located in the highest elevations had been removed from the data set. Conclusions: There is a weak negative relationship between tree species diversity and above-ground biomass in natural forests of Central Europe.

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The diversity of forest trees as an indicator of ecosystem health can be assessed using the spectral characteristics of plant communities through remote sensing data. The objectives of this study were to investigate alpha and beta tree diversity using Landsat data for six dates in the Gonen dam watershed of Turkey. We used richness and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices to calculate tree alpha diversity. We also represented the relationship between beta diversity and remotely sensed data using species composition similarity and spectral distance similarity of sampling plots via quantile regression. A total of 99 sampling units, each 20 m x 20 m, were selected using geographically stratified random sampling method. Within each plot, the tree species were identified, and all of the trees with a diameter at breast height (dbh) larger than 7 cm were measured. Presence/absence and abundance data (tree species number and tree species basal area) of tree species were used to determine the relationship between richness and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, which were computed with ground field data, and spectral variables derived (2 x 2 pixels and 3 x 3 pixels) from Landsat 8 OLI data. The Shannon-Weiner index had the highest correlation. For all six dates, NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) was the spectral variable most strongly correlated with the Shannon index and the tree diversity variables. The Ratio of green to red (VI) was the spectral variable least correlated with the tree diversity variables and the Shannon basal area. In both beta diversity curves, the slope of the OLS regression was low, while in the upper quantile, it was approximately twice the lower quantiles. The Jaccard index is closed to one with little difference in both two beta diversity approaches. This result is due to increasing the similarity between the sampling plots when they are located close to each other. The intercept differences between two investigated beta diversity were strongly related to the development stage of a number of sampling plots in the tree species basal area method. To obtain beta diversity, the tree basal area method indicates better result than the tree species number method at representing similarity of regions which are located close together. In conclusion, NDVI is helpful for estimating the alpha diversity of trees over large areas when the vegetation is at the maximum growing season. Beta diversity could be obtained with the spectral heterogeneity of Landsat data. Future tree diversity studies using remote sensing data should select data sets when vegetation is at the maximum growing season. Also, forest tree diversity investigations can be identified by using higher-resolution remote sensing data such as ESA Sentinel 2 data which is freely available since June 2015.

The microbial diversity was analyzed based on a high-throughput sequencing approach that targets the V3-V4 region of the bacteria 16S ribosomal RNA genes. Results: Compared with healthy controls, acne patients had significantly increased transepidermal water loss (TEWL), pH levels, sebum, porphyrins, and red areas, and reduced skin microbiome diversity according to the goods coverage diversity index (p = 0.021), Shannon diversity index (p = 0.037), and Simpson diversity index (p = 0.023). Moreover, the diversity gradually decreased with the increase in acne grading. Based on the principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) analysis plot, the skin microbiota of acne patients and healthy controls could be divided into two different sets, which could not be used to separate acne patients with different disease severity. Finally, this study found that both TEWL and sebum were negatively associated with the Shannon and Simpson diversity index. Meanwhile, the taxa Enhydrobacter and Stenotrophomonas were positively associated with TEWL, stratum corneum hydration, respectively.Conclusion: This study demonstrated that acne vulgaris exists in patients with both damaged epithelial barriers and associated microbiota dysbiosis; the findings will help improve the understanding of the disease and may contribute to the development of better treatment options.																			1178-7015						2022	15						2065	2075		10.2147/CCID.S377759	http://dx.doi.org/10.2147/CCID.S377759								36196252					WOS:000869919200001

Region of southern NY. Streams were sampled with a Surber sampler in May and June of 2001 (pre-harvest) and 2002 (post-harvest). Macroinvertebrates were hand sorted in the field, placed in 70% alcohol, and returned to the lab for identification to genus. The macro invertebrates collected were distributed across 7 orders and 26 families. Faunal community structure varied greatly between years within the reference sites. A variety of indices were computed from the sample data: index of biotic integrity, Hilsenhoff improved biotic index, family level biotic index, North Carolina biotic index, functional feeding groups, and Shannon H and Simpson D diversity indices. These indices provided no evidence that a partial harvest negatively impacted water quality. Diversity may have been reduced following harvesting, but the high variability precluded a definitive conclusion.																									2004							38	40																WOS:000189483300016

For a diversity index that possesses the sum property, such as species richness N, Shannon's entropy H or Simpson's index I ID, the community diversity is decomposable into species-level patterns and the sum of single species diversities gives the pooled diversity of the species collection. In this paper, parametric diversity of type a is used to quantify how fertilizer applied to soil affects the relative contribution of species endemic or preferential to serpentine soils within a garigue plant community in Tuscany (Italy). Soil fertilizer significantly improved the biomass production of the original species pool without any significant colonization by alien species. However, the major biomass increments were experienced by species that are not exclusive to serpentine soils. In this view, the reduced abundance of species endemic or preferential to serpentine soils can be interpreted as a loss of 'ecological quality' of the analyzed community. (C) 2003 Elsevier SAS.

Percent canopy covered by understory plant species of three growth forms (shrubs, forbs, grasses) and total understory were determined over a two year period following treatment. Two diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's index) were used to quantify multi-nutrient fertilization effects on understory plant diversity. Multi-nutrient fertilization prescribed to increase overstory tree growth did not typically reduce understory vegetation diversity, rather diversity increased following fertilization on some sites. Understory composition at the time of treatment greatly determined fertilization effects on diversity as follows: 1) if most species in the plant community responded relatively the same after treatment, then diversity was unchanged even though total biomass increase may have been large; 2) if a highly responsive species was abundant Drier to treatment, then diversity decreased following fertilization; and 3) if a highly responsive species was relatively rare prior to treatment, then diversity increased following fertilization. Multi nutrient forest fertilization generally did not affect understory plant diversity, but where changes did occur, diversity increases were more common than decreases.

Methods The study sites were Dongjiu Bridge (DJ), Linji Bridge (LZ), and Birishen Mountain Scenic Spot (RB) in Gongbu Nature Reserve, Southeast Tibet, China. Species composition and distribution pattern of the underground seed bank inP.densataforest were analyzed. Germination data and field investigations were used to examine the similarities between aboveground vegetation and underground seed banks, and their responses to the environment. Results There were 47 species belonging to 27 families in the underground seed bank of theP. densataforest. Asteraceae, Rosaceae, Labiatae, and Poaceae were dominant, accounting for 40.4% of the total number of families. Underground seed density was 2,114, 1,952, and 1,141 seeds/m(2)in DJ, LZ, and BR, respectively. The percentage of different life-forms in each sampling location was shown to be perennial herbs > shrubs > annual herbs > trees > subshrubs. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Margalef richness index, and Simpson's dominance index of each sample showed that species decreased with higher elevation, while the Pielou evenness index showed the opposite trend. Elevation, slope position, slope aspect, and slope were positively correlated with the Pielou evenness index and negatively correlated with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Margalef richness index, and Simpson's dominance index. The Sorensen index, comparing the similarity between the underground seed bank and aboveground vegetation of DJ, LZ, and BR was 0.46, 0.35, and 0.31, respectively. Conclusion The underground seed bank ofP. densataforest has high seed density and high species richness, but there was little similarity between aboveground vegetation and underground seed bank. Elevation and slope position had a great influence on the uniformity of species distribution.

J	Shimatani, K; Kubota, Y				Shimatani, K; Kubota, Y			Quantitative assessment of multispecies spatial pattern with high species diversity	ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH												This paper developed statistical methods for quantitatively assessing spatial pattern of communities with abundant species richness such as in tropical forests. Based on multivariate point processes, species richness and the Simpson's diversity index can be extended to the functions illustrating basic characteristics of multispecies spatial pattern. The spatial extension of the species richness is a sum of the detectabilities of constituent species within a given distance. By means of calculating the functions for individuals belonging to specific size class, the size structure of multispecies spatial pattern can also be examined. Therefore, comprehensive analysis of species, size, and spatial pattern together with the roles of each species in a community can be conducted. This paper demonstrated its descriptive utility in exploratory analysis by applications to four subtropical forest tree communities of different ages in Okinawa Island, southern Japan, all of which have abundant species richness. The results quantitatively revealed the contrasts among the four stands ranging from a young secondary stand to an old-growth forest as well as changes of relative positions of species in communities depending on their ecologic properties.																			0912-3814	1440-1703				MAR	2004	19	2					149	163		10.1111/j.1440-1703.2003.00619.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1440-1703.2003.00619.x													WOS:000220176300002

The watershed is highly urbanized, including over 17 percent impervious surface cover (ISC) by area. Imperviousness in a watershed has been linked to fish community structure and integrity. Generally, above 10 to 12 percent ISC there is marked decline in fish assemblages with fish being absent above 25 percent ISC. This study quantifies the importance of ground water in maintaining fish species diversity in subbasins with over 30 percent ISC. Valley Creek contains an atypical fish assemblage in that the majority of the fish are warm-water species, and the stream supports naturally reproducing brown trout, which were introduced and stocked from the early 1900s to 1985. Fish communities were quantified at 13 stations throughout the watershed, and Simpson's species diversity index was calculated. One hundred and nine springs were located, and their flow rates measured. A cross covariance analysis between Simpson's species diversity index and spring flow rates upstream of fish stations was performed to quantify the spatial correlation between these two variables. The correlation was found to be highest at lag distances up to about 400 m and drop off significantly beyond lag distances of about 800 m.																			1093-474X	1752-1688				OCT	2004	40	5					1269	1275		10.1111/j.1752-1688.2004.tb01585.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1752-1688.2004.tb01585.x													WOS:000224721900012

The results showed the presence of 10 genera of wild bees visiting natural flowers and belonging to four families: Andrenidae, Anthophoridae, Halictidae, and Megachilidae. The Apidae family was represented by honeybee (Apis mellifera L.) and bumblebee (Bombus ruderatus siculus Dalla Tone et Friese). Census of bee populations revealed the abundance of wild bees with 66.26% of flowers visits, honeybee with 31.98%, B. ruderatus and Xylocopa violacea with 1.59 and 0.17% of total fauna, respectively. The beginning flight activity of these species started from a minimum threshold of temperature and humidity. The alimentary specialization was quantified by Simpson's diversity index (I-s) and by Shannon's diversity index (Ish) Apis mellifera had the highest floral visits index (I-s = 0.866) and the broadest alimentary niche index (I-sh = 0.316).

Complementarity of community indices in characterizing aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION												Community indices are commonly used in ecology to characterize and track species assemblages. However, their use is also critically discussed. Unclarities remain about what the various community indices actually represent, their appropriateness in representing ecological status, and their drawbacks. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the context-specificity of aquatic macroinvertebrate community index scores in lotic and lentic water bodies. To this end, a large set of macroinvertebrate distribution data in surface waters of the Netherlands was analysed. Five indices were considered, including the diversity indices species richness, Shannon diversity, and Simpson diversity, and two diagnostic indices, the number of rare species and the number of indicator species. Patterns in index scores were compared between lotic waters, lentic waters, and the combined dataset. We observed that the correlation between index scores was not as strong as often assumed. In addition, patterns in index scores differed between lotic and lentic waters, with deviating ranges in scores. These results showed that the interpretation of the patterns in macroinvertebrate community indices scores is dependent on the water type. This highlights the importance of reporting multiple community index scores and of careful interpretation of their meaning within the appropriate context. This should be considered to make appropriate choices in the use of these indices in future water quality assessment and environmental management.																				2351-9894				OCT	2023	46								e02604	10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02604	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2023.e02604		AUG 2023											WOS:001059439700001

Richness and evenness can be studied using Simpson's Index with its associated Reciprocal Index, and with Shannon-Weiner's Index "H" and Index "E". Lieberson provides the means to measure isolation and interaction, and Dissimilarity works well to identify segregated communities. Results using these indices show that the Historically Black College of Dentistry is a culturally vibrant and diverse academic and social environment. White students at the Historically Black College of Dentistry are more likely to enjoy interaction with other Whites than will Historically Black and Hispanic students at all other dental schools, except at the other Medical College, the only other HBCU with a dental school. Overall, there was no statistical diversity difference between the Historically Black College of Dentistry and all other dental schools over the 10 year study period. Statistically significant correlations between each index provided a framework for using each index in prediction modeling. Recent methods to manage multi-collinearity, such as extracting unstandardized residuals to use as adjusted coefficients add promise that all indices can be used in future diversity studies.																					978-1-60960-858-3; 978-1-60960-857-6				2012							212	227		10.4018/978-1-60960-857-6.ch013	http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-60960-857-6.ch013	10.4018/978-1-60960-857-6												WOS:000363569500015

The several platforms of next generation sequencing (NGS) to study viral quasispecies offer a magnifying glass to study viral quasispecies complexity. Several parameters are available to quantify the complexity of mutant spectra, but they have limitations. Here we critically evaluate the information provided by several population diversity indices, and we propose the introduction of some new ones used in ecology. In particular we make a distinction between incidence, abundance and function measures of viral quasispecies composition. We suggest a multidimensional approach (complementary information contributed by adequately chosen indices), propose some guidelines, and illustrate the use of indices with a simple example. We apply the indices to three clinical samples of hepatitis C virus that display different population heterogeneity. Areas of virus biology in which population complexity plays a role are discussed.

The composition and diversity of soil microbial communities across a subalpine forest successional series were therefore investigated in the Wanglang National Nature Reserve on the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. The calculated diversity indices of soil bacteria (8.598 to 9.791 for Shannon-Wiener, 0.997 to 0.974 for Simpson, 4131 to 4974 for abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) and 3007 to 3511 for Species richness indices), and ACE (1323 to 921) and Species richness (1251 to 879) indices of soil fungi decreased from initial to terminal succession stages, but Shannon-Wiener and Simpson of soil fungi indices varied slightly with forest succession. Meanwhile, the composition and structure of soil microbial communities varied markedly with forest succession. The relative abundance of the dominant bacterial phyla (Acidobacteria, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria) and fungal taxa (Mortierellomycota, Rozellomycota and unassigned phylum clade GS01) varied considerably with forest succession. However, regardless of successional stage, Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria dominated soil bacterial communities and Ascomycota and Basidiomycota dominated soil fungal communities. Moreover, the changes in soil microbial diversity with forest succession were significantly affected by soil pH, soil organic carbon, soil temperature, altitude, and non-woody debris stock. Importantly, soil pH was the dominant driver of soil microbial community shift with forest succession. In conclusion, the forests at different succession stages not only conserve same microbial populations, but also nurse unique microbial diversity across the forest succession series; and the biodiversity of soil bacterial and fungal communities has differential responses to forest succession.					wang, zhihui/HSF-6639-2023	Yang, Wanqin/0000-0002-4399-2914; Li, Xuqing/0000-0002-6431-7731														1999-4907				FEB	2022	13	2							289	10.3390/f13020289	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13020289													WOS:000762797200001
J	Dörgeloh, WG				Dörgeloh, WG			Diversity of the herbaceous layer in mixed bushveld	JOURNAL OF RANGE MANAGEMENT												The diversity of the herbaceous layer in the Nylsvley Nature Reserve (Mixed Bushveld) was investigated to enhance the understanding of savanna ecosystems and to serve as a baseline for future monitoring to facilitate management. Species composition and density, dry weight contribution per species, and grass density was measured with a small-quadrat method, A total of 73 grass species were recorded. Plant communities were compared in terms of percentage composition and percentage dry weight per ecological group, species diversity and grass density with general linear modeling, The herbaceous layer of most plant communities consisted predominantly of increaser I species (increasing in under-utilized areas), with increaser I and decreaser species (decreasing with under or over-utilization) producing the highest biomass. The dominance of increaser LII species (becoming dominant in heavily over-grazed areas) in the Sporobolus ioclados -Acacia tortilis Savanna indicates previous over-utilization of this plant community. A generally high species diversity (Simpson's index 1-D >0.72) in the reserve is influenced by environmental factors and is a reflection of previous low animal stocking densities and a rotational burning regime, Grass density varied from 53.07 to 219.13 grasses/m(-2). A negative correlation (r = -0.6654) between grass density and species density supports the principle that species diversity is reduced in over-grazed areas. The high diversity of the herbaceous layer in the Nylsvley Nature Reserve may serve as a benchmark for comparing range diversity over time and space within this vegetation type.																			0022-409X					SEP	1999	52	5					519	524		10.2307/4003781	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/4003781													WOS:000082837300017

To elucidate the diversity patterns in macroalgae communities, five Mediterranean sites (Eastern Harbor (EH), Abu Talat (AT), El Mex Bay (EM), SidiBishir (SB) and El-Tabia pumping (TPS) were examined during June 2019. Macroalgae found on the Alexandria coast was 5 species namely, Ulva Fasciata, Ulva Compressa, Corallina Officinalis, Carollina Elongate and Petrocladia Capillacea. Patterns of alpha and beta diversity were evaluated across macroalgal habitats, in relation to different levels of heavy metal accumulation and physicochemical parameters. We found significant spatial differences in alpha diversity and moderate value of the beta index (average similar to 0.6) explained by the high variation of pollution by heavy metals. The abundance of the Ulva fasciata is higher than those of other macroalgae. EH is the location that has the highest diversity index value (H'), the richness index of species (D), the highest evenness index (E), and Simpson index 1.28, 0.33, 0.59, and 0.69 respectively.

Seasonal and altitudinal changes in population density of 20 species of <i>Drosophila</i> in Chamundi hill	JOURNAL OF INSECT SCIENCE												A year long study was conducted to analyze the altitudinal and seasonal variation in a population of Drosophila (Diptera: Drosophilidae) on Chamundi hill of Mysore, Karnataka State, India. A total of 16,671 Drosophila flies belonging to 20 species of 4 subgenera were collected at altitudes of 680 m, 780 m, 880 m and 980 m. The subgenus Sophophora was predominant with 14 species and the subgenus Drosilopha was least represented with only a single species. Cluster analysis and constancy methods were used to analyze the species occurrence qualitatively. Altitudinal changes in the population density, and relative abundance of the different species at different seasons were also studied. The diversity of the Drosophila community was assessed by applying the Simpson and Berger-Parker indices. At 680 m the Simpson Index was low at 0.129 and the Berger-Parker index was high at 1.1 at 980 m. Linear regression showed that the Drosophila community was positively correlated with rainfall but not elevation, Furthermore the density of Drosophila changed significantly in different seasons (F = 11.20, df 2, 9; P<0.004). The distributional pattern of a species or related group of species was uneven in space and time. D. malerkotliana and D. nasuta were found at all altitudes and can be considered as dominant species.																				1536-2442				AUG 3	2010	10								123										20879913					WOS:000280573100001

Influence of the seed tree method on the diversity of regeneration in a mixed forest in Durango, Mexico	REVISTA CHAPINGO SERIE CIENCIAS FORESTALES Y DEL AMBIENTE												Introduction: Forest managers need to know the impact of regeneration cuts on tree species diversity in order to conserve it. Objective. To evaluate changes in tree species richness and diversity after applying the seed tree method in six communities. Materials and methods. The communities of Cienega Grande, Las Cienegas, La Colmena, El Venado, Los Bajios and Pino Gordo of the Pueblo Nuevo ejido, Durango, were divided into three plots called: a) regeneration in seed trees cuttings (RST); b) regeneration in adult trees (RAT); and c) adult trees (AT). Starting from the center of each RST plot, and following the cardinal and subcardinal points, eight sites of 25 m(2) and 0.1 ha were located to record the regeneration and adult tree species, respectively. Species richness indicators (Shannon-Wiener, Simpson, Pielou and Sorensen) were estimated to characterize the plots by community and were compared with t-tests and rarefaction analysis. Results and Discussion. Twelve species were recorded in the study area, of which 11 are found as a renewal of seed trees. Species richness in the RST plots with respect to that of AT was equal in the Cienega Grande, El Venado and La Colmena communities, and higher in Las Cienegas and Los Bajios. The Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices were higher in Pino Gordo, Los Bajios and El Venado. The Sorensen index ranges from 0.67 to 1.0, indicating high species similarity among plots. Conclusions. The seed tree method in a mixed forest ensures the continuity of tree species diversity.																			2007-3828	2007-4018				MAY-AUG	2019	25	2					219	234		10.5154/r.rchscfa.2018.09.066	http://dx.doi.org/10.5154/r.rchscfa.2018.09.066													WOS:000470998000005

After 7 days of drought stress treatment, the composition of the fungi community in the rhizosphere of alfalfa underwent significant changes, we found Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were the dominant fungi groups in all treatments, indicating that drought-stressed environments play a crucial role in shaping their communities. The results showed significant effects of drought on the & alpha;-diversity, Chao1, Pielou-e, Shannon and Simpson of rhizospheric fungi. The Simpson index was highest for severe stress in LD, while the Chao1 index was highest for moderate stress in QS and GN. The Pielou-e, Shannon and Simpson indices were highest for their respective controls. In addition, the study found that drought stress had a significant impact on endogenous hormone concentrations in alfalfa roots. As drought stress increased, the levels of gibberellin (GA(3)) and zeatin (ZA), as well as the GA(3)/abscisic acid (ABA) ratio, initially increased and then decreased, with the highest levels observed under moderate stress, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), IAA/ABA, and (IAA + GA(3) + ZA) /ABA were decreased and were the lowest under severe stress, while ABA content was increased in the roots and was the highest under severe stress. The study found a correlation between the endogenous hormone content of roots and rhizosphere fungi. GA(3) (12.8%) and GA(3)/ABA (12.7%) were identified as significant driving factors in the composition of fungi.																			0167-6903	1573-5087				2023 AUG 10	2023										10.1007/s10725-023-01062-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10725-023-01062-5		AUG 2023											WOS:001044828700001
J	Hill, MO				Hill, MO			An evenness statistic based on the abundance-weighted variance of species proportions	OIKOS												A measure of diversity can be based on Simpson's index lambda, which is the abundance-weighted mean of species proportions. Likewise, an index of evenness, E-MS = (Sigma p(i)(2))(2)/Sigma p(i)(3), can be based on the abundance-weighted coefficient of variation of species proportions p(i). E-MS measures the shape of the species-abundance relation, and is 0.75 + 0.25 lambda(2) for the geometric series distribution. This simple relation allows the geometric series to be used as a benchmark; communities that have relatively long 'tails' of rare species have correspondingly low evenness, whereas communities with short 'tails' have high evenness. Except for species richness, there is no necessity to reject the view that diversity and evenness are measurable parameters of a community rather than statistics of a sample.																			0030-1299					JUN	1997	79	2					413	416		10.2307/3546027	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3546027													WOS:A1997WZ10300022

The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replicates and four treatments (compost, sheep manure, inorganic fertilizer and control). The effect on the weed was determined by the use of different diversity indices (Shannon-Weiner, Simpson, Pielou and Richness). It was found that Simpson index was higher in compost, while Shannon-Weiner index in control treatment. Pielou index had a similar trend with Shannon Weiner index. The biodiversity of weed flora was similar for all the treatments and the number of species was greater by 44% in the compost in relation to the control, and by 19% in relation to manure and inorganic fertilization (k-dominance). It was observed that Amaranthus retroflexus was the dominant species in all treatments. Its presence in experimental plots with compost was 64%, 44% and 40% higher than control, sheep manure and inorganic fertilization, respectively. Moreover, density and dry weight of weed flora were not affected by different organic fertilization. In conclusion, the results indicated that processed tomato crop can be grown in organic systems, without the organic fertilizers having a negative effect on weeds. (C) 2016 The Authors.

J	Leinster, T; Cobbold, CA				Leinster, Tom; Cobbold, Christina A.			Measuring diversity: the importance of species similarity	ECOLOGY												Realistic measures of biodiversity should reflect not only the relative abundances of species, but also the differences between them. We present a natural family of diversity measures taking both factors into account. This is not just another addition to the already long list of diversity indices. Instead, a single formula subsumes many of the most popular indices, including Shannon's, Simpson's, species richness, and Rao's quadratic entropy. These popular indices can then be used and understood in a unified way, and the relationships between them are made plain. The new measures are, moreover, effective numbers, so that percentage changes and ratio comparisons of diversity value are meaningful. We advocate the use of diversity profiles, which provide a faithful graphical representation of the shape of a community; they show how the perceived diversity changes as the emphasis shifts from rare to common species. Communities can usefully be compared by comparing their diversity profiles. We show by example that this is a far more subtle method than any relying on a single statistic. Some ecologists view diversity indices with suspicion, questioning whether they are biologically meaningful. By dropping the naive assumption that distinct species have nothing in common, working with effective numbers, and using diversity profiles, we arrive at a system of diversity measurement that should lay much of this suspicion to rest.																			0012-9658	1939-9170				MAR	2012	93	3					477	489		10.1890/10-2402.1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/10-2402.1								22624203					WOS:000302957300006

Microbial diversities were determined by using methods of cultured isolates and carbon source utilization on Biolog EcoPlate (TM). The results showed that radiation changed soil microbial community structure and function. With the increasing of radiation pollution, the number of bacteria and actinomycetes declined gradually. Carbon utilizations of microbial community were significant ly different from each other (rho<0.05). Microbial activity decreased gradually; Simpson index and McIntosh index increased, but Shannon-Wiener index was not significant different; the major utilized substrates indicated that microbes more tend to use carboxylic acids and polymers as carbon sources, instead of carbohydrates.

Ecosystem functions varied according to biotic and abiotic factors, however, the effects of abiotic factors (e.g. elevation) on this relationship was rarely investigated, especially in areas impacted by human activities. We explored the relationships between aboveground biomass (AGB), a key proxy of ecosystem func-tioning, and plant species diversity in semiarid forests of western Iran submitted to a long history of past dis-turbances. Forty forest patches were sampled according to an elevation gradient (1700-2100 m) and to two types of forest cover: open cover indicating an intense past use or closed cover for more preserved forests. For each patch, the composition of woody species was recorded and woody species diversity indices (richness, Simpson, Shannon and Evenness) were calculated. We also estimated AGB and computed a wide set of community-weighted mean or functional divergence of ecological traits for woody species. We found that AGB sharply decreased with elevation (from 105.68 & PLUSMN; 10.29 ton/ha at 1700 m to 36.18 & PLUSMN; 6.43ton/ha at 2100 m) for the closed cover but variations were much less pronounced for the open cover (16.32 & PLUSMN; 2.97 ton/ha to 30.83 & PLUSMN; 1.96 ton/ha, respectively). Diversity indices (richness, Simpson, Shannon) increased with elevation for the closed cover and the other traits exhibited strong variations with elevation (either positive or negative) whereas no clear trend was visible in the open cover. Similar results were found when computing the linear relationships between AGB and the different diversity indices which were highly significant in the closed cover only. Surprisingly, the relationships were negative between AGB and most diversity indices (e.g., richness, Shannon, Simpson, Even-ness). The dominant Persian oak was in fact the main contributor to AGB which was reduced in stands with a higher tree mixture, a result in line with the mass ratio hypothesis. Our results also illustrate the long-lasting effects of past conservation management on the forest cover and in shaping the relationships between forest ecosystem functions (AGB production) and biodiversity in semiarid areas.

The direct effects (e.g., loss of area) have been well studied. However, knowledge about the indirect influence of urbanization through edge effects on the biodiversity in remnant forests is limited.Methods: In this study, we surveyed woody plant species in 72 plots in nine remnant forest patches in Guiyang, China. We examined the influences of urbanization and edge effects on the species diversity and composition of woody plants in remnant forests. We compared alpha diversities and quantified compositional dissimilarities in interior and edge sites at different levels of urbanization. We also measured the niche width of the recorded plant species and assessed whether high levels of urbanization and edge effects increased the number of generalist species.Results and conclusions: The Shannon index, the Simpson index and the Pielou index of adult trees were lowest in the edge habitat under high levels of urbanization. Significant differences in the Shannon index and the Simpson index of sapling/seedling were detected between interior and edge sites under low urbanization. The edge effects on the species composition of adult trees were intensified by high levels of urbanization. Woody plant species with wide niche widths were more abundant at edge sites under high levels of urbanization. Therefore, we recommend that urban expansion surrounding remnant patches should be strictly controlled to alleviate edge effects on biodiversity.

The fungi community structure and diversity in Chinese liquor fermenting grains was studied, using high-throughput sequencing. Results show that fermenting grains' fungi community structure changed with fermentation time, and the changes were dependent on the type of fermenting grains. This illustrated that addition of cellulase-producing bacteria had impacted the fermenting grains' fungi community structure. Diversity analysis showed that the addition of cellulase-producing strain had no obvious effect on fungi community's abundance index (Ace/Chao), while there was a significant influence on fungi community's Shannon and Simpson index. Correlation analysis showed that the addition of the cellulase-producing strain had significant positive correlation with the fungi community's Shannon index, and had a significant negative correlation with the fungi community's Simpson index. The conclusion was that the addition of the cellulase-producing strain significantly improved the fungi community's richness, but reduced its dominance, and this increased the fungi community's uniformity in the fermenting grains. As a result of this change, total ester, ethyl acetate, ethyl butyrate, and ethyl caproate content in the fermenting grains and liquor significantly increased, while the ethyl lactate content decreased when 10(6) cfu/g of cellulase-producing bacteria were added.					ma, rui/JGE-4890-2023														0361-0470	1943-7854					2018	76	2					130	140		10.1080/03610470.2018.1424401	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03610470.2018.1424401													WOS:000450122600007
J	Hosseinzadeh, A				Hosseinzadeh, Abbas			Distributional record of oak gall wasp (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) species' diversity in different regions of West-Azerbaijan, Iran	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY												Among gall-inducing insects, the majority of species are gall wasps (Hymenoptera: Cynipidae) that occur on oak trees (Quercus spp.) and produce galls on a certain part of the host. In this survey, oak gall wasp species were collected from the oak forests of Pardanan, Mirabad, Nalas, Sardasht, Hamran and Dar-ghabr in West-Azerbaijan province. The galls occurring on 50 cm sampled branches from four cardinal directions on each tree were counted multiple times throughout the season. Species richness of oak gall wasps was estimated for each region and also species diversity indices such as Simpson's index, Shannon's H', and Sorensen similarity quotient were calculated. In this survey, 40 oak gall wasps species were identified. Most galls were found on Quercus infectoria. All of the collected oak gall wasps belonged to seven genera: Andricus, Cynips, Neuroterus, Chilaspis, Pseudoneuroterus, Biorhiza and Aphelonyx. Among these species, 28 were related to the Andricus genus. The highest Simpson and Shannon indices were recorded in the Dar-ghabr and Pardanan regions in the fall, respectively. The highest Sorensen similarity was recorded in the spring's galls (sexual generation of oak gall wasps) and fall' galls (asexual generation) between Pardanan and Mirabad, and between Pardanan and Dar-ghabr regions, respectively. Differences in the local distribution of oak species, especially their subspecies, and the climate of the locations should be considered as main factors in oak gall wasp species diversity and the distribution of oak gall wasp species.						hosseinzadeh, abbas/0000-0003-1951-0214													1684-5315					NOV 16	2011	10	72					16361	16366		10.5897/AJB11.2094	http://dx.doi.org/10.5897/AJB11.2094													WOS:000298557500032

This calculation was used to compare the discriminating power of auxotype and serovar determination and plasmid content analysis, either singly or in combination, for Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates having different antimicrobial susceptibilities (i.e., antibiotic-susceptible isolates and those that produce penicillinase, carry plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracycline, have chromosomally mediated penicillin resistance, or both produce penicillinase and carry plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracycline). Plasmid content analysis and auxotype determination produced the lowest level of discrimination, while a combination of auxotype and serovar typing schemes generally provided higher levels of discrimination. Addition of plasmid content analysis to auxotype and serovar typing provided additional discrimination only with penicillinase-producing isolates. For isolates that carried plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracycline, isolates that were tetracycline resistant, isolates that both produced penicillinase and carried plasmid-mediated resistance to tetracycline, or isolates that had chromosomally mediated penicillin resistance, none of the typing methods produced high discriminatory indices, indicating that these isolates are probably derived from relatively few clones.																			0095-1137					OCT	1993	31	10					2831	2833		10.1128/JCM.31.10.2831-2833.1993	http://dx.doi.org/10.1128/JCM.31.10.2831-2833.1993								8253999					WOS:A1993LY05900058

Recently, use of the Rao quadratic entropy index has been advocated since it allows comparison of various facets of diversity (e.g. taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional) within the same mathematical framework. However, if not well implemented, the Rao index can easily yield biologically meaningless results and lead into a mathematical labyrinth. As a practical guideline for ecologists, we present a critical synthesis of diverging implementations of the index in the recent literature and a new extension of the index for measuring beta-diversity. First, we detail correct computation of the index that needs to be applied in order not to obtain negative beta-diversity values, which are ecologically unacceptable, and elucidate the main approaches to calculate the Rao quadratic entropy at different spatial scales. Then, we emphasize that, similar to other entropy measures, the Rao index often produces lower-than-expected beta-diversity values. To solve this, we extend a correction based on equivalent numbers, as proposed by Jost (2007), to the Rao index. We further show that this correction can be applied to additive partitioning of diversity and not only its multiplicative form. These developments around the Rao index open up an exciting avenue to develop an estimator of turnover diversity across different environmental and temporal scales, allowing meaningful comparisons of partitioning across species, phylogenetic and functional diversities within the same mathematical framework. We also propose a set of R functions, based on existing developments, which perform different key computations to apply this framework in biodiversity science.					de Bello, Francesco/HCI-1196-2022; Thuiller, Wilfried/G-3283-2010; Meynard, Christine N/B-2082-2010; de Bello, Francesco/H-1582-2014; Leps, Jan/B-6913-2013; de Bello, Francesco/AFQ-8650-2022	de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; Thuiller, Wilfried/0000-0002-5388-5274; Meynard, Christine N/0000-0002-5983-6289; de Bello, Francesco/0000-0001-9202-8198; Leps, Jan/0000-0002-4822-7429; 													1100-9233					OCT	2010	21	5					992	1000		10.1111/j.1654-1103.2010.01195.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1654-1103.2010.01195.x													WOS:000281551000016

Multi-locus typing scheme for <i>Babesia bovis</i> and <i>Babesia bigemina</i> reveals high levels of genetic variability in strains from Northern Argentina	INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION												Bovine babesiosis, caused by the protozoa Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina, is a tick-borne disease distributed in tropical regions worldwide. Current control measures are based on the use of acaricides and live attenuated vaccines. The major economic impact of babesiosis lies in the cattle industry. In order to gain insight into the extent of genetic diversity in populations of parasites in the field, we developed two MLST schemes for the molecular genotyping of B. bigemina and B. bovis. We have also developed a custom-designed bioinformatic pipeline to facilitate the automated processing of raw sequences and further diversity and phylogenetic analysis. The overall MLST scheme exhibited the maximum discriminatory power (Simpson Index = 1) for B. bovis and a high level of discrimination for B. bigemina (Simpson Index = 0.9545). Genetic diversity was very high and infections with multiple genotypes were frequently found for both parasites in outbreak samples from the Northeast and Northwest of Argentina. Recombination events, which could have arisen from these multiple infections, were suggested by intra-loci linkage disequilibrium analysis and the lack of congruence in phylogenetic trees from individual genes. The two MLST schemes developed here are a robust, objective and easily adoptable technology to analyze the genetic diversity and population structure of parasites of the genus Babesia.

Remote sensing is a vital way to monitor the status and changes of PD. Most of the existing methods rely on a field botany survey to construct a statistical relationship between PD and remote sensing observations. However, a field botany survey is too costly to be applied widely. In this study, we constructed a new remote sensing index of PD (RSPD), combining the spectral variation hypothesis and productivity hypothesis. Concretely, the RSPD integrated the multi-band spectral reflectance and several spectral greenness, moisture, and red-edge vegetation indices with the principles of Shannon information entropy and Euclidean distance. The RSPD was evaluated by comparing the classical coefficient of variation (CV) method and the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices based on vegetation classification results. Two cases were selected, where Case I was in Beijing and Case II was located in part of Huai'an, China. Sentinel-2 data in three years of 2016, 2018, and 2020 and higher-resolution Pleiades-1 data in 2018 were also utilized. The results demonstrate that: (1) the RSPD is basically consistent with the CV in spatiotemporal variation; (2) the RSPD outperforms the CV as compared with Shannon and Simpson diversity indices that are based on vegetation classification results with Sentinel-2 and Pleiades-1 data; (3) the RSPD outperforms the CV as compared with visual interpretations with Google Earth image. The suggested index can reflect the richness and evenness of plant species, which is inherent in its calculation formula. Moreover, it has a great potential for large-scale regional and long-term series monitoring.

Community diversity of microbial mat samples was assessed at 8:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. in a combined analysis consisting of 16S rRNA-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles. The divergence index determined from PLFA and DGGE data showed that depth-related differences have a greater influence on diversity than temporal variations. Shannon and Simpson indices yielded similar values in all samples, which suggested the stable maintenance of a structurally diverse microbial community. The increased diversity observed at 3:00 p.m. between 2.5 and 4 mm can be explained mainly by diversification of anaerobic microorganisms, especially sulfate-reducing bacteria. In the afternoon sampling, the diversity index reflected a higher diversity between 4 and 5.5 mm depth, which suggested an increase in the diversity of strict anaerobes and fermenters. The results are consistent with the conclusion that hypersaline microbial mats are characterized by high degree of diversity that shifts in response to the photobiological adaptations and metabolic status of the microbial community.

The impacts of thermocline stratification intensity on biodiversity-ecosystem relationships were assessed using phytoplankton and zooplankton indicators from four stages of stratification in Lake Qiandaohu. There were significant differences in biomass, species diversity, and resource use efficiency (RUEpp = phytoplankton biomass/total phosphorus) for phytoplankton between continuous stratification and mixing periods, but only in FDis and RaoQ diversity indices for zooplankton. Phytoplankton species diversity and RUE were higher in the formative and stable periods, while zooplankton species diversity and zooplankton biomass/phytoplankton biomass (RUEzp) were lower. When combining the data from the four periods, a negative linear pattern was found between phytoplankton Simpson's, functional dispersion (FDis), and Rao's Quadratic (RaoQ) diversity indices, and thermocline depth (TD). Only zooplankton FDis and RaoQ diversity indices were significantly positively related to TD. Phytoplankton RUE was significantly negatively related only to its Pielou's evenness (J) diversity, while zooplankton RUE was significantly negatively related to its J, FDis, and RaoQ diversity indices.

Principal component analysis and cluster analysis were used to analyze the diversity of 11 main fruit quality characters. The results showed that the average variation coefficient of 11 characters was 28.68%, with the smallest of dry matter (7.37%), and the largest of vitamin C (83.84%). There was a large diversity difference among the characters. The range of Simpson index was 0.985-0.971, and the range of Shannon-Weaver index was 3.931-4.182. Characters such as soluble solids content and titratable acid showed high genetic diversity. The difference analysis showed that all characters were significantly different from at least one other character. The principal component analysis showed that the first three principal components could reflect 74.286% of the information of the tested kiwifruit germplasm resources, and could summarize the basic characteristics of fruit quality. The contribution rate of each character was scattered, and the character variation was multi-directional. Q-type cluster analysis divided all the tested resources into four groups at the grade boundary L3 =16.56 and all kiwifruit pubescens were clustered into one group. There were certain characteristics within the group, differences between groups, and certain regional clustering trends. The top five varieties with comprehensive evaluation scores were Ganly-r, 'Ganlv-2', 'Hongyang; 'Yihuang-2', and 'Ganhong-2', with the best comprehensive performance in fruit quality in the south of Jiangxi province, showing the value of further adaptive cultivation and breeding. Based on the fruit characters, the genetic diversity of kiwifruit germplasm resources in the south of Jiangxi province was studied, which provided the basis for the regional exploitation and utilization of high-quality kiwifruit resources, resource protection, and new variety breeding.

Material and Methods: Samples were collected from sub-gingival fluids of nine participants by swabbing technique. The participants were divided into S groups, namely the control (not periodontitis and RA), periodontitis, and RA. The total number of bacteria was calculated by using direct culture in serial dilution by applying the total plate count method. Isolation of microbiota was conducted by pour plates and incubated in an anaerobic jar. The bacterial diversity was performed by Simpson index and DNA Isolation. Results: There were differences in the concentration of sub-gingival fluids bacteria in the control group with the periodontitis and RA group. The microbiota composition profiles were different for each group. The bacterial isolate 4, 5 and 22 were found in all groups, while isolate 14 was assumed to be related to the metabolic pathway in microbiota abnormalities associated with disease progression. Conclusion: The Simpson index has a value >0.61 with high bacterial dominance; however, the diversity of microbiota is at a low level of diversity. We assumed that isolate it was associated with development of RA disease.

We compared, through the use of diversity indices and species abundance models, the diversity of communities of epigeous ants occurring in two different vegetational structures: native forest and eucalyptus plantation. To capture the ants, 800 soil pitfall traps were used, in eight sample series. A total of 85 species, belonging to 36 genera of seven subfamilies were collected in the two environments. Of these species, 83 occurred in the native forest and 60 in the eucalyptus plantation. The species diversity as evaluated by Simpson's index was not significantly different between the environments, but the Shannon index indicated a higher diversity of species in the native forest. The log-series model could not be adjusted satisfactorily to the data for the ant communities from either the eucalyptus plantation or the native forest; however, the log-normal model appeared appropriate to describe the community structure in both environments. The broken-stick model, which represents a well-structured community, was only adjusted to the data for the native forest sites.

We examine the impact of the 2008 recession on asset diversity and the way individual socio-economic characteristics as well as important life events affect this measure. The focus of our analysis is on financial assets. We use a unique panel data set that provides us with comprehensive household level data for 2007 and 2009 in the United States-the Survey of Consumer Finances. We find that asset diversity increases between 2007 and 2009. In addition, it increases with age, education and income and it is lower at the bottom of the wealth distribution. Life changing situations such as getting divorced or losing one's job have a statistically significant negative effect on a change in diversity, while getting married or having deteriorating health have a positive effect. Active money management also affects asset diversity positively.

Are there additional implications for assemblage structure? Here we use Berger-Parker d, Simpson's 1/D and Simpson's E to measure the ecological diversity of pristine and perturbed freshwater fish assemblages in Trinidad, West Indies, and Oklahoma, USA. Although the impacted sites typically had fewer species than expected, they could not be distinguished from unperturbed ones of equivalent richness. Changes in the evenness of these assemblages are thus driven by changes in richness. One practical outcome is that diversity indices may not provide independent verification of the detrimental consequences of pollution. The similarity in structure of naturally and anthropogenically impoverished assemblages provides no grounds for complacency, however, since it ignores the evolutionary history of the species concerned. On the basis of our results we suggest that species provenance may be important in tests of ecological function. Moreover, these investigations should replicate natural patterns of evenness as well as richness.

ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Analysis of a recently validated fragmentation index, named 'coherence', shows a direct relationship with the Simpson and Shannon indices. Since these diversity metrics are also denoted as 'entropy metrics', it can be accepted that patch size heterogeneity can adequately be described by an entropy metric. Since both indices are used to determine the entropy of a sample, the Brilloum index should be applied instead to correctly determine the entropy of a landscape pattern, this because this latter index is developed for fully censused data sets, such as landscapes when a complete coverage by cartographic data or imagery is available. Calculation of the Brillouin entropy index for three specific sites located in Cadiz Township (USA), the Poole Basin (Dorset, UK) and Sao Paulo State (Brazil), respectively, and using long-term data of patch size diversity, reveals increasing entropy levels associated with anthropogenic land cover dynamics (fragmentation). The observed entropy trends defy the laws of thermodynamics and signal the impact of human action on landscape integrity. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, reported links between overstory tree and understory herb species diversity have been inconsistent, due to variations in forest types and environmental conditions. Here, we measured species richness (SR) and diversity (Shannon-Wiener (H') and Simpson's (D) indices) of overstory trees and understory herbs in the protected Tianshan Wild Fruit Forest (TWFF), Northwest China, to explore their relationships along the latitudinal, longitudinal, elevational, and climatic (current climate and paleoclimate) gradients in 2018. We found that SR, and H' and D diversity indices of overstory trees and understory herbs exhibited a unimodal pattern with increasing latitude and elevation (P<0.05) and negative associations with longitude (P<0.01). Along the climatic gradients, there were U-shaped patterns in SR, and H' and D diversity indices between trees and herbs (P<0.05). SR, and H' and D diversity indices for overstory tree species were positively associated with those for understory herbs (P<0.01). These findings indicate that overstory trees and understory herbs should be protected concurrently in the TWFF to increase effectiveness of species diversity conservation programs.					chen, jia/JLM-4733-2023; Yang, Tian/JFB-1008-2023	Zhang, Yuanming/0000-0003-1370-4181													1674-6767	2194-7783				2020 JUL	2020	12	4					618	629		10.1007/s40333-020-0055-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40333-020-0055-0		JUN 2020											WOS:000541305200001

Diversity of <i>emm</i> sequence types in group A beta-haemolytic streptococci in two remote Northern Territory Indigenous communities: Implications for vaccine development	VACCINE												There is a high burden of disease due to group A streptococcus (GAS) in remote Northern Territory (NT) Indigenous communities. A proposed 26-valent GAS M-type vaccine covers 80-90% of pharyngeal and invasive isolates in the US. We examined the diversity and distribution of emm types in two remote Indigenous communities in the NT Top End over a 17-year period and compared them to the proposed vaccine types. Eighty emm types were identified between 1991 and 2007. Diversity in both communities was high (overall Simpson's index 0.976), but varied between communities. Prior to 2004, 71 emm types were identified and an additional 9 emm types were identified during a period of active surveillance in 2004-2005. The proposed 26-valent vaccine would be expected to cover only 20% of emm types recovered in this study. Of the 80 emm types, 16(20%) were new sequence types identified since the last assignment of M types in 2002. The diversity of streptococcal isolates was higher than that reported from most industrialized countries, and similar to that described in several developing countries. A vaccine based on such a variable antigen is unlikely to provide effective protection in the highest risk populations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Gebler, D; Wiegleb, G; Szoszkiewicz, K				Gebler, Daniel; Wiegleb, Gerhard; Szoszkiewicz, Krzysztof			Integrating river hydromorphology and water quality into ecological status modelling by artificial neural networks	WATER RESEARCH												The aim of the study was to develop predictive models of the ecological status of rivers by using artificial neural networks. The relationships between five macrophyte indices and the combined impact of water pollution as well as hydromorphological degradation were examined. The dataset consisted of hydro morphologically modified rivers representing a wide water quality gradient. Three ecological status indices, namely the Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR), the Macrophyte Biological Index for Rivers (IBMR) and the River Macrophyte Nutrient Index (RMNI), were tested. Moreover two diversity indices, species richness (N) and the Simpson index (D) were tested. Physico-chemical parameters reflecting both water quality and hydromorphological status were utilized as explanatory variables for the artificial neural networks. The best modelling quality in terms of high values of coefficients of determination and low values of the normalized root mean square error was obtained for the RMNI and the MIR networks. The networks constructed for IBMR, species richness and the Simpson index showed a lower degree of fit. In all cases, modelling quality improved by adding two hydromorphological indices to the pool of explanatory variables. The significant effect of these indices in the models was confirmed by sensitivity analysis. The research showed that ecological assessment of rivers based on macrophyte metrics does not only reflect the water quality but also the hydromorphological status. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Liao, PC; Huang, BH; Huang, S				Liao, Pei-Chun; Huang, Bing-Hong; Huang, Shong			Microbial community composition of the Danshui river estuary of northern Taiwan and the practicality of the phylogenetic method in microbial barcoding	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												In this study, the microbial community in a mangrove ecosystem was surveyed and used to test the eligibility of 16S rDNA library and neighbor-joining method for the purpose of estimating microbial composition. Genetic diversity (pi) and four other diversity indices (Simpson's unbiased, Shannon-Wiener, Evenness, and Chao1 indices) were applied to estimate the adaptive lineages of microorganisms in the mangrove ecosystem. The results indicated that gamma-Proteobacteria is the most diverse taxon, while the most abundant family is Rhodobacteraceae (alpha-Proteobacteria), followed by Comamonadaceae (beta-Proteobacteria). This result may imply the existence of a graded distribution of microbial diversity across a spectrum of different salinities in the waterbody of this estuary ecosystem. Furthermore, at least 500-1,000 bps of the posterior portion of 16S rDNA is required as a marker to profile the microbial diversity in a microcosm of interest using phylogenetic methods, according to the results of our sliding window analyses for the measurements of pi, consistency index, and retention index.					赵, 鹏/B-8401-2009	Liao, Pei-Chun/0000-0003-1733-5504													0095-3628	1432-184X				OCT	2007	54	3					497	507		10.1007/s00248-007-9217-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00248-007-9217-2								17318679					WOS:000249971800011

This can lead to shifts in structure and functions of phytoplankton communities adversely affecting the quality of drinking water sources, which in turn impairs public health. Relationships between structures of phytoplankton communities and concentrations of the toxicant, microcystin-leucine-arginine (MC-LR), have not been well examined in large shallow lakes. The present study investigated phytoplankton communities at seven locations from January to December of 2015 in Tai Lake, and relationships between structures and diversities of phytoplankton communities and water quality parameters, including concentrations of MC-LR and metals, were analyzed. Results: A total of 124 taxa of phytoplankton were observed, and the predominant taxa were Microcystis sp. and Dolichospermum flos-aquae of Cyanophyta and Planctonema sp. of Chlorophyta. The greatest diversities of phytoplankton communities, as indicated by species richness, Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, the Berger and Parker, and the Pielou evenness indices, were observed in spring. Furthermore, productivity of phytoplankton was significantly and negatively correlated with diversities. These results demonstrated that Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, the Berger and Parker, and the Pielou evenness indices of phytoplankton communities were significantly related to trophic status and overall primary productivity in Tai Lake. In addition, temperature of surface water, pH, permanganate index, biochemical oxygen demand, total phosphorus, arsenic, total nitrogen/total phosphorous ratio, and MC-LR were the main factors associated with structures of phytoplankton communities in Tai Lake. Conclusion: The present study provided helpful information on phytoplankton community structure and diversity in Tai Lake from January to December of 2015. Our findings demonstrated that Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, the Berger and Parker, and the Pielou evenness indices could be used to assess and monitor for status and trends in water quality of Tai Lake. In addition, MC-LR was one of the main factors associated with structures of phytoplankton communities in Tai Lake. The findings may help to address important ecological questions about the impact of a changing environment on biodiversity of lake ecosystems and the control of algae bloom. Further studies are needed to explore the relationship between MC-LR and phytoplankton communities in the laboratory.

However, despite their importance, there have been no reports of CWD stocks and characteristics in the Qinling Mountains. We measured the CWD stocks in different CWD types, decay classes and diameter classes of the five forest types in the Qinling Mountains. The highest biomass of CWD was the Pinus tabulaeformis forest (12.57 t.hm(-2)), occupied 5.66% in the biomass of this forest, the lowest occupied 1.03% in Betula albo-sinensis forest (1.82 t.hm(-2)). Our results revealed that there was a strong correlation between CWD and forest biomass. When the CWD biomass were 9.9 t.hm(-2) and 11.6 t.hm(-2), the biomass of Pinus armandi forest and P. tabulaeformis forest reached maximum, respectively. CWD is particularly important for biodiversity, but the importance of CWD in the control of diversity in forest systems has not been fully appreciated and certainly has not been evaluated intensively within China, especially in Qinling forests. In our research, we used species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener index (H), Simpson index (D) and Pielou's evenness index (J) to assess the diversity of plant community. According to our analysis, we found 1) the effect of CWD biomass onthese a diversity index was dependent on tree, shrub and herb in the five forest types, 2) the impacts of CWD biomass on understory biodiversity were more obvious, 3) With the increase of CWD biomass, the species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener index (H) and Simpson index (D) of understory increased significantly. Our results suggested that there was a relatively lower CWD biomass in the Qinling Mountains, but it had significant effects on forest biomass and diversity of plant community. Reserving CWD was important for eco-forestry, but how many and how characteristic of CWD should be retained need further research. Development of CWD reasonable strategies was indispensable for future forest management.

Given this, we used a long-term operation experiment across a contrasting mixed broadleaved-Pinus koraiensis forest, Betula platyphylla forest, and Larix gmelinii plantation forest to explore the variations of soil properties and microbial community after 5 years of shrub removal on Changbai Mountain, as well as the contribution of the soil properties and understory plant diversity to the soil microbial community. The results demonstrated that shrub removal could significantly alter soil SWC and TN, TP, and AP contents of the L. gmelinii, as well as N/P of B. platyphylla. Moreover, shrub removal also clearly improved soil bacterial Pielou_e index and Simpson index of mixed broadleaved-P. koraiensis and soil bacterial Simpson index of L. gmelinii, and decreased soil fungal Pielou_e index and Shannon index of L. gmelinii and soil bacterial Pielou_e index and soil fungal Shannon index of B. platyphylla. Identically, shrub removal notably altered the soil bacterial community composition. Soil characteristics and understory plant diversity accounted for 48.02% and 26.88%, and 45.88% and 27.57% of the variance in the bacterial and fungal community composition, respectively. This study aimed to provide an important scientific basis for the restoration and sustainable management of temperate forests in the Changbai Mountain region.

In addition, some fungal isolates were evaluated for the risk they pose as plant pathogens. In total, 1836 endophytic fungi were isolated from C. kawakamii from Hehuanjian, Puli Township, and Tatachia. They were classified into 2 phyla, 8 classes, 40 families, and 68 genera. Colletotrichum, Fusarium, Phomopsis, and Xylaria, (Ascomycota, Sordariomycetes) were the dominant genera. The genus accumulation curve (based on the bootstrap estimator) was non-asymptotic, with estimated richness significantly exceeding the richness captured by our sampling to date. Considering the collection time, the data indicated significant differences in the proportions of the C. kawakamii endophyte genus from Hehuanjan, Puli Township (across two seasons), and Tatachia. The Shannon and Gini-Simpson indices revealed variations in diversity, with C. kawakamii endophytes (Puli Township in winter) significantly reducing alpha diversity compared with other seasons and locations. Meanwhile, the Gini-Simpson index suggested that there were no significant differences in richness among the four sampling sites. The PCA results unveiled distinct community structures across different locations and seasons, explaining 46.73% of the total variation in fungal community composition significantly affected diversity and richness. In addition, a considerable number of Fusarium isolates exhibited harmful properties towards wheat, potatoes, and apples. It is postulated that these fungi belong to the Fusarium tricinctum species complex (FTSC).																				2309-608X				NOV	2023	9	11							1076	10.3390/jof9111076	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/jof9111076								37998881					WOS:001123250000001

Sampling was carried out at 10 stations for three seasons with 45 days intervals using a Surber sampler. Simpson, Shannon-Weiner and Margalef diversity indices, as well as biological indices for Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP), Average Score Per Taxon (ASPT), Hilsenhoff Family Biotic Index (HFBI), and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) were calculated at all stations. In this study, a total of 21 families of macrobenthos in seven orders were identified. Organisms in the Baetidae family were dominant at stations 1D, 2D and 6D in the Dehbar River and at stations 1Z and 1 K in the Zoshk and Kang rivers, respectively. The greatest diversity of macrobenthos was observed in the spring. There was significant correlation between the three biological indices. In general, water quality of the rivers at the upstream stations was not good. The diversity indices decreased from upstream to downstream, and the biological indices showed a similar reduction in water quality from upstream to downstream.

Our results were compared to previous studies and show changes in species distribution and diversity indices, due to environmental changes caused by climate changes and anthropic activities. We noticed the absence of the Grayling (Thymallus thymallus) and Stone loath (Barbatula barbatula) mentioned in previous studies. and the first record of Prussian carp (Carassius gibelio) in Iara River catchment. Also, the Caps dam (Iara - Fantanele deviation) blocks the upstream migration of Common bullhead (Cottus gobio). The calculated diversity indices (Shannon H, Simpson 1-D, Margalef Md Berger-Parker d and Evenness J') show a low species diversity.

Distribution and Diversity of Zooplankton with the Environmental Factors in some Lentic Water bodies from Bihar, INDIA	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT												Freshwater ecosystems harbour zooplankton that fills as a significant part of the food chain of water bodies. Tragically, these ecosystems and diversity therein are compromised by a lot environmental pressure and pollution. An investigation was led from January 2018 to December 2019 to examine variation in zooplankton with the physicochemical profiles of Katira pond and Surya Mandir pond, Arrah keeping standard methods. Observations showed that during summer season water temperature, total alkalinity, hardness and chloride were observed more during summer season followed by the rainy , post-rainy and rainy season but a reverse pattern was observed for pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and sulfate. The water temperature demonstrated a positive relationship with total alkalinity, hardness and chloride whereas a negative correlation with pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and sulfate. 43 genera of zooplankton together with 15 rotifers, 10 protozoa, 9 cladocerans, 6 copepods and 3 ostracods were related to a numerical density from 1 to 538unit/L. The density of zooplankton was more distinguished throughout the colder time followed by summer, pre-rainy and rainy seasons. Zooplankton density showed a positive relationship with pH, dissolved oxygen, nitrate and sulfate however a negative relationship with water temperature, chloride, total alkalinity and hardness. Statistical analysis inferred critical contrasts in the spatial variation over physicochemical parameters (excluding nitrate), zooplankton groupings and biodiversity indices (excluding Simpson index).

Use of multiple endpoints to assess the impact of captivity on gut flora diversity in Long Island Sound <i>Fundulus heteroclitus</i>	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												We evaluated the impact of short-term captive housing on gut flora diversity in Fundulus heteroclitus by characterizing culturable gut bacteria immediately after fish capture and following short-term (28-day) captive housing. Bacterial colony and cell morphology served as crude but statistically significant endpoints for detecting alteration in culturable gut bacteria following F. heteroclitus short-term captive housing. 16S rRNA sequence analyses of isolates from short-term captive-housed F. heteroclitus produced fewer families (68%), genera (69%), and species (63%) identities resulting in lower species richness (63%), 2.4-fold lower Margalef's Index, 1.7-fold lower Menhinick's Index, 28.6% lower Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index, 2.1-fold greater Simpson Dominance Index, 1.5-fold greater Berger-Parker Dominance, and 2.9-fold lower Fisher's Alpha Diversity Index. When comparing isolate populations from field and short-term captive-housed fish, Sorenson's Similarity Coefficient (CC) was 0.081, and Jaccard's Distance Coefficient (1-J) was 0.958. Based upon these observations, our study provides clear evidence for the substantial and negative impact of short-term captive housing on F. heteroclitus gut flora diversity.																			0378-1909	1573-5133				2022 JUL	2022	105	7					867	883		10.1007/s10641-022-01293-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-022-01293-x		JUL 2022											WOS:000828290200002
J	Hao, RX; Meng, CC; Li, JB				Hao, Ruixia; Meng, Chengcheng; Li, Jianbing			Impact of operating condition on the denitrifying bacterial community structure in a 3DBER-SAD reactor	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY												Two main operating parameters (influent C/N ratio and electric current intensity) were examined for their impacts on the denitrifying bacterial community structure in an integrated system of three-dimensional biofilm-electrode reactor and sulfur autotrophic denitrification (3DBER-SAD). It was found that genus beta-proteobacteria played a leading role under different operating conditions. The influent C/N ratio illustrated a great impact on denitrifying bacteria diversity. When the C/N ratio decreased from 1.07 to 0.36, the Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index increased from 2.44 to 2.71 and from 0.89 to 0.92, respectively, while the proportion of heterotrophic denitrifying bacteria Thauera decreased from 61.4 to 21.1%, and the sulfur autotrophic denitrifying bacteria (e.g., genus Sulfuricella and Thiobacillus denitrificans) increased from 3.5 to 19.3%. In terms of the impact of electric current intensity, the Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index decreased from 2.71 to 2.63 and from 0.92 to 0.90, respectively, as the current intensity increased from 60 to 400 mA.

Religious Diversity and Religious Participation in US Jewish Communities	PROFESSIONAL GEOGRAPHER												This article examines variations in Jewish denominational identification (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform, and Just Jewish) among fifty-five U.S. Jewish communities completing local Jewish community studies from 1993 through 2011. We relate these variations to levels of religious and ethnic participation, contributing to the literature on how and whether religious pluralism relates to religious and ethnic participation. First, five denominational clusters are created via k-means cluster analysis (high Orthodox; equal, except Orthodox; high Reform; high Reform/low Just Jewish; and high Just Jewish). We then examine differences in geographic and demographic factors and in levels of religious participation among these denominational clusters. Second, various indexes of Jewish denominational diversity (index of dissimilarity, Shannon Index, Simpson Index, and largest group) are developed. The relationship of the level of Jewish denominational diversity to religious and ethnic participation is explored. The basic finding is that more Jewish denominational diversity does result in higher levels of religious participation but not ethnic participation.																			0033-0124	1467-9272					2019	71	1					39	51		10.1080/00330124.2018.1455520	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00330124.2018.1455520													WOS:000462288200004

Schrad as a Medicinal Plant: Role of Tissue Type and Sampling Location on the Diversity	MOLECULAR BIOTECHNOLOGY												Endophytic fungi are an important group of organisms in association with plants which are able to colonize all plant internal tissues and improve their fitness. The present research aims to isolate and identify endophytic fungi of Citrullus colocynthis plant and then investigate the effects of sampling location and tissue type on the fungal endophyte diversity of this plant. To do so, a sampling program was done in 11 geographically isolated C. colocynthis growing areas of Hormozgan province, Iran. For molecular identification of endophytic fungi of C. colocynthis, the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS4), as a universal DNA barcode marker for fungi, was amplified using primer sets. Totally, 12 taxa (Alternaria solani, Cladosporium halotolerans, Setosphaeria rostrata, Aspergillus niger, A. allahabadii, A. terreus, A. occultus, A. cristatus, Penicillium chrysogenum, Talaromyces purpureogenus, Fusarium sp., and Pseudozyma flocculosa) were isolated. Our findings also showed that the diversity of fungal endophytes isolated from C. colocynthis was affected by the tissue type and sampling site. Accordingly, the leaves and seeds were found to have the highest and lowest rates of endophyte colonization and richness in all sampling seasons, respectively. Simpson's diversity index of 0.8165 in root tissue indicated the high diversity of endophytes in this organ. In addition, Shannon's diversity index in the root (1.846) was higher than that in the other organs. The highest Shannon's and Simpson's indices were observed in Khoon Sorkh and Minab regions. Generally, at least two factors (region and type of tissue) played the most important roles in determining the composition of fungal endophytes in C. colocynthis.																			1073-6085	1559-0305				2023 JAN 4	2023										10.1007/s12033-022-00630-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12033-022-00630-w		JAN 2023						36600117					WOS:000907777500001

Hence, this study has characterized major boundary types and the associated woody species diversity and socioeconomic role of boundary agroforestry in northwestern Ethiopia. One hundred and twenty households were randomly selected for household surveys and vegetation inventories were carried out in 80 purposively selected boundary agroforestry sites. Variation in Simpson, Shannon-Wiener and Evenness indices among boundary types was analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Four different boundary types were identified, based on place and purpose of establishment. Altogether, 58 woody species representing 33 families were recorded. The mean number of woody species was 22, while the mean Simpson, Shannon-Wiener and Evenness indices for woody species were 0.61, 2.33, and 0.67, respectively. Survey results showed that woody species diversity was significantly higher in homestead boundaries. Lower diversity was calculated for in-farm boundaries. Similarity in composition of woody species among boundary types ranged between 0.33 and 0.38. Eucalyptus globulus ranked first in terms of the Importance Value Index, while Justicia schimperiana was the most woody woody species. Private production of seedlings was the main source of planting material for establishment of boundaries. Tending, pruning, pollarding, coppicing, and firming were the most important management practices. Seventeen use types were recorded, each represented by 6-56 species. Boundary agroforestry constitutes 9.40% of the annual income for the local community. Generally, the study showed that boundaries accommodated high species diversity and are important for household livelihood improvement, beautification of landscapes and biodiversity conservation in arable landscapes.

Samples were collected from six hill country (Ballantrae) and two lowland (Aorangi) pastures in New Zealand. Samples were collected in summer (March) and Autumn (May) and subsamples were dissected to determine botanical composition and species diversity. Measures of diversity included species richness, Shannon's index, and Simpson's index. Reflectance data were collected from a second subsample that had been dried and finely ground. Calibrations were developed using modified partial least squares. Acceptable calibration equations were developed for predicting values of all variables evaluated in the study. It appears feasible that with further refinement NIRS could be used routinely for predicting diversity of pasture samples and for reducing the process time when a large number of samples is required.

Remote sensing is an efficient alternative to traditional field work to map tree species diversity over large areas. Previous studies have used light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and imaging spectroscopy (hyperspectral or multispectral remote sensing) for species richness prediction. The recent development of very high spatial resolution (VHR) RGB images has enabled detailed characterization of canopies and forest structures. In this study, we developed a three-step workflow for mapping tree species diversity, the aim of which was to increase knowledge of tree species diversity assessment using deep learning in a tropical wetland (Haizhu Wetland) in South China based on VHR-RGB images and LiDAR points. Firstly, individual trees were detected based on a canopy height model (CHM, derived from LiDAR points) by the local-maxima-based method in the FUSION software (Version 3.70, Seattle, USA). Then, tree species at the individual tree level were identified via a patch-based image input method, which cropped the RGB images into small patches (the individually detected trees) based on the tree apexes detected. Three different deep learning methods (i.e., AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet50) were modified to classify the tree species, as they can make good use of the spatial context information. Finally, four diversity indices, namely, the Margalef richness index, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, the Simpson diversity index, and the Pielou evenness index, were calculated from the fixed subset with a size of 30 x 30 m for assessment. In the classification phase, VGG16 had the best performance, with an overall accuracy of 73.25% for 18 tree species. Based on the classification results, mapping of tree species diversity showed reasonable agreement with field survey data (R-Margalef(2) = 0.4562, root-mean-square error RMSEMargalef = 0.5629; R-Shannon-Wiener(2) = 0.7948, RMSEShannon-Wiener = 0.7202; R-Simpson(2) = 0.7907, RMSESimpson = 0.1038; and R-Pielou(2) = 0.5875, RMSEPielou = 0.3053). While challenges remain for individual tree detection and species classification, the deep-learning-based solution shows potential for mapping tree species diversity.					ao, zurui/HDO-2187-2022; Xin, Qinchuan/O-3276-2014	Xin, Qinchuan/0000-0003-1146-4874; Huang, Jianfeng/0000-0002-1940-5708; LAO, DAZHAO/0000-0002-7731-4054; Ao, Zurui/0000-0003-0444-8139														1999-4907				NOV	2019	10	11							1047	10.3390/f10111047	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10111047													WOS:000502262700113

The discrimination power of three subunits sequences from nuclear ribosomal RNA gene cluster were determined by Simpson's index of discrimination using 43 wild O. sinensis fruiting bodies, pure cultures, commercial mycelium fermented powder and counterfeits. The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences showed the highest variance and discrimination power among 43 samples, as determined by Simpson's index of discrimination (D = 0.972), followed by large subunit (LSU; D = 0.963) and small subunit (SSU; D = 0.921). ITS-2 sequences showed the highest discrimination power for 43 samples among ITS-1, ITS-2, and 5.8S region of ITS sequences. All O. sinensis samples were grouped into a unique ITS sequence cluster under 95% similarity and two O. sinensis samples and six non-O. sinensis samples showed false claims. Our data showed that the ITS region could provide accurate species identification for O. sinensis samples, especially when macroscopic and microscopic method could not be applied in the highly processed commercial products. Since the authentication of O. sinensis related products is essential to ensure its safety and efficacy, identification of O. sinensis through ITS sequence comparison or unique PCR amplification of the species specific target, such as the ITS region, should be considered in the next revision of Chinese pharmacopeia.

J	Guil, N; Sanchez-Moreno, S				Guil, Noemi; Sanchez-Moreno, Sara			Fine-scale patterns in micrometazoans: tardigrade diversity, community composition and trophic dynamics in leaf litter	SYSTEMATICS AND BIODIVERSITY												Studies on micrometazoan local distribution patterns are needed to understand microscopic organisms' evolution in the light of the related influences of historical and ecological events. Tardigrades encompass a set of rare and unique characteristics to study evolutionary hypotheses. Particularly interesting are leaf litter tardigrades, due to their connection with soil dynamics: although tardigrades have been frequently considered occasional or accidental inhabitants coming from nearby habitats. In this study, leaf litter tardigrade diversity from a central Spain mountain system was determined using four diversity descriptors: species richness, abundance, and two diversity indexes (Shannon and Simpson), and a diversity trophic index (TD). In addition, community composition was analysed using Canonical and Discriminant Analyses. Fifteen types of leaf litter were explored in the present survey, many not previously studied, all of them containing tardigrades. We have found 39 species, 20 are being recorded for the first time in leaf litter, and increasing to 20% the global tardigrade diversity reported for leaf litter worldwide, with the total number of species now being 99. The same genera that were reported being present in high species diversity at global scale were found to be highly diverse at local scale in this study. Three eutardigrade families previously reported as beech litter inhabitants were not found in our survey, probably because beech litter was not included in the present survey, suggesting that further work studying a more diverse range of litter would increase reported tardigrade diversity worldwide. Tardigrade species abundances depended on high level plant categories (plant divisions and type of tree), while tardigrade diversity patterns were related with type of leaves. Broad leaves had higher diversity values (Shannon, Simpson, species richness, trophic groups) than any other leaf, probably due to their association to dense forests presenting humid conditions and high resources availability, associated with this leaf. Xerophilous leaves presented high diversity of species (heterotardigrades) well-adapted to xeric open space in our survey. Type of leaves also changed abundance dynamics of different tardigrade trophic groups. Different biotic and abiotic conditions in different types of leaves promoted varying abundances of carnivore, herbivore and microbivore tardigrades on those different micro-ecosystems. Implications and consequences of these findings in evolutionary hypotheses for microfauna are considered.

J	Gray, JS				Gray, JS			The measurement of marine species diversity, with an application to the benthic fauna of the Norwegian continental shelf	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MARINE BIOLOGY AND ECOLOGY												Species diversity includes two aspects, the number of species (species richness) and the proportional abundances of the species (heterogeneity diversity). Species richness and heterogeneity diversity can be measured over different scales; a single point, samples, large scales, biogeographical provinces and in assemblages and habitats. In the literature, the terminology of these scales is confused. Here, scales are given a uniform notation. Scales of species richness and heterogeneity diversity are distinguished from turnover (beta) diversity, which is the degree of change in species composition along a gradient. Methods of measurement of the scales of species richness, heterogeneity diversity, turnover diversity and for estimating total species richness are reviewed. Two methods for measuring heterogeneity diversity are recommended Exp H' (where H' is the Shannon-Wiener index) and 1/Simpson's index, together with an equitability index J'. The reviewed methods are then applied to a data set from the Norwegian continental shelf to illustrate the advantages of the recommended methods. Finally, the application of the methods to assessment of effects of disturbance, to studies of gradients of species richness and to conservation issues are discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In total, we recorded and identified 207 species and subspecies in the study area. Species cover, richness and diversity indices varied significantly by vegetation type (P < 0.01). Available NO3- and Ca++ in the soil were important factors for the area and species representation in the species-environment correlations estimated for the Kavakli area.

A preliminary survey of the herpetofaunal diversity of BHRF was conducted from September 2018 to February 2019 resulting in 103 individuals (37 species) of amphibians and reptiles found. This includes 14 species of frogs from six families and 10 genera; 14 species of lizards from four families and 11 genera; eight species of snakes from five families and eight genera; and one species of freshwater turtle. From these results, Batu Hampar Recreational Forest has a high herpetofaunal diversity with a Simpson's Index of Diversity of 0.869 and a Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index of 2.930. In the future, additional surveys over longer periods of time should be conducted at BHRF to produce a more complete checklist.

Sampling was performed in spring, summer and fall 2017. Following biotic indices are used: EPT taxa richness, Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP), Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), Stroud Water Research Center index (SWRC), Family biotic index (FBI), as well as diversity indices: Shannon-Weaver index (H), Simpsons index (D), Hill's index (Hi), Mergalef index (D-Me) and Menhicnik's index (D-Ma). Our results show the presence of 34 macroinvertebrate taxa in Lepenci river which belong to Insecta, Crustaceans and Annelidae. The water quality along the river show variation from high and good class upstream, to moderate, poor and bad, downstream. The Pearson's bivariate correlation used to analyze the relationship between physicochemical parameters with biotic and diversity indices showed a significant correlation (p < 0.01) of EC, TSS, O-2, COD, BOD, NH4, and PO43- with biotic indices EPT, BMWP, ASPT, SWRC, FBI. We can conclude that the values of biotic and diversity indices have shown differences in water quality between polluted and unpolluted sites and reflect the ecological status of the river, therefore we can consider them as valuable tools for water quality assessment in rivers in Kosovo.

The role of the microbial community in TSCC development and progression is unclear. In the present study, 23 patients with TSCC were recruited. Tissue DNA was extracted from cancer and paracancerous normal tissues from all participants. Next-generation 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing and functional prediction were applied for taxonomic analysis. Alpha diversity measurements using the Shannon and Simpson diversity indexes indicated a significant increase in the microbiotic diversity of cancer samples (Shannon index: P = 0.001, Simpson index: P = 0.015); otherwise, no differences were found when using observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and Chao1 index (observed OTUs: P = 0.261, Chao1 index: P = 0.054). The dominant phyla of the microbiota included Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Fusobacteria. Multivariate analysis of variance (Adonis) and nonparametric analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) based on unweighted unifrac distances demonstrated differences in the bacterial community structure between the two groups (P = 0.001 for Adonis, P = 0.001 for ANOSIM). Compared with the normal samples, Neisseria, Streptococcus, and Actinomyces levels decreased significantly in cancer samples. Co-occurrence network analysis implied that the bacterial community in cancer was more conserved than that in normal tissue. Matched-pair analysis of cancer and control samples revealed a significant alteration in the relative abundance of specific taxa.

Through extended historical research involving past and present botanical inventories of the central mountains, particularly of the Hehuanshan area of Taiwan, we are now able to examine the floristic composition of four elevation zones, 2,000-2,500 m, 2,500-3,000 m, 3,000-3,500 m, and 3,500-3,950 m. We selected four study sites, namely Shinjenkan (SJK) at 2,250-2,585 m, Shihmenshan (SMS) at 3,000 m, Hehuan East Peak (HEP) at: 3,401 m, and Hehuan Major Peak (HMP) at 3,408 m, and determined their alpha, beta, and gamma diversities along with their Simpson"s diversity indices. Our results clearly showed that the species richness (alpha diversity) was significantly high and decreased as the altitude increased. Coincidently, Simpson's diversity index at 2,250 m was significantly high at 0.85, drastically decreased to 0.17 at 3,145 m, and continued to decrease to 0.10 at both sites at 3408 m. On the other hand, by comparing plant distribution data collected over a century for the Hehuanshan, Alishan and Yushan areas, we were able to predict that plants would migrate mostly from a lower to a higher elevation when the global temperature increases. For instance, in the Hehuanshan area, 16 species would move towards higher elevations and seven species would remain in their original zone. In the Alishan area, seven species would migrate and four would remain in their original zone, and in Yushan, 15 species would migrate out of their zone and five would remain. Of all of the species, at least six risk extinction, since their expected migration would take them far beyond the limits of the land available above 3,950 m. It is concluded that the alpine vegetation will be redistributed, many plant species will move towards a higher elevation and, eventually, at least six plant species (Anaphalis morrisonicola, Artemisia morrisonensis, Swertia randaiensis, Hypericum nagasawai, Angelica morrisonicola, and Cirsium arisanensis) will become extinct.

Species assemblages and community structure of deep-sea demersal ichthyofauna of the South-eastern Arabian Sea (SEAS)	JOURNAL OF THE MARINE BIOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED KINGDOM												Studies of species assemblages and community structure are of vital importance in the deep-sea realm. Data for the present study were collected during the research expedition of FORV 'Sagar Sampada' in the latitude 8.02 degrees N and 11.58 degrees N, longitude 74.16 degrees E and 78.35 degrees E. High Speed Demersal Trawl - Crustacean Version (HSDT-CV) was used for the operations at a depth of 200 and 1000 m. The total catch came to 2148.35 kg from 10 stations. An analysis of the catch composition was made. Total catch was dominated by Priacanthus hamrur (27.66%) followed by Neoepinnula orientalis (15.57%), Psenopsis cyanea (10.05%), Glyptophidium oceanium (3.55%), Lamprogrammus niger (3.17%), Narcine timlei (3.08%), Lamprogrammus sp. (2.6%), Pterigotrygla hemisticta (2.17%). About 76 species recorded from 22 orders were identified. The diversity indices, Cluster analysis, k-dominance plot were analysed using PRIMER v6 software. The diversity indices including Margalef richness index (d), Shanon index (log e(2)), Pielou's evenness index (J') and Simpson diversity index (1 - lambda) were calculated. Diversity indices were compared with the previous studies in the same area, and this can be a reference point for future studies.

J	Lalonde, BA; Ernst, W				Lalonde, Benoit A.; Ernst, William			Analysis of Benthic Invertebrate Communities as a Function of Distance from Two Fish-Processing Plant Effluent Discharges in New Brunswick, Canada	ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY												Benthic invertebrate communities have been known to change due to impacts from nutrient-rich industrial outputs, such as those from pulp and paper, sewage-treatment plants, or aquaculture. Fish-processing plants have been recognized as contributors of large volumes of nutrient rich effluent to marine and estuarine environments, but their effect on benthic invertebrate communities is unknown. Benthic invertebrates and sediment samples were obtained from marine sampling stations at 0-, 10-, 30-, and 100-m distances from two fish-processing outfalls in Atlantic Canada. Sediment grain size, total organic carbon (TOC), ammonia, sulphide, and redox, as well as invertebrate abundance, density, taxa richness, Simpson's Inverse Diversity Index, Bray-Curtis Index of (%) Similarity, and the AZTI marine biotic index (AMBI), were determined for all sampling sites. Results from this study illustrate that taxa richness and density significantly increased as distance from the outfall discharge increased. In our study, TOC was only significantly correlated to AMBI but not to the other benthic invertebrate assemblage descriptors calculated in this study (invertebrate density, taxa richness, Simpson's Inverse Diversity Index). The study results suggest that taxa richness and density may be affected by effluent from fish-processing plants.

J	Roebuck, A; Hurley, L; Slater, D				Roebuck, Alex; Hurley, Lara; Slater, Duncan			Assessing the species diversity and vulnerability of urban tree populations in the London borough of Westminster	URBAN FORESTRY & URBAN GREENING												The level of tree species diversity in urban tree populations can have serious implications for urban forest resilience and has a direct impact on ecosystem functioning at the local level. Few studies have measured the relationship between tree species diversity and vulnerability in UK urban forests. This study analysed the species composition, species diversity and the vulnerability to pests and diseases of 10,149 public trees in the London borough of Westminster across three land use types: housing, parks, and highways. Tree species diversity was significantly different across these land use types (Shannon's diversity index (H) was 2.47 for housing sites, 1.63 for parks and 0.83 for highways) and we found that higher diversity appears to result in reduced vulnerability, evidenced by negative correlations between tree species diversity and susceptibility to pests and diseases. A stronger negative correlation was found between vulnerability and species richness than between vulnerability and Gini-Simpson's diversity index. Our study reinforces the role of biodiversity indices in establishing and monitoring baseline levels of UK urban tree diversity. Our findings may inform future tree planting projects, help to ensure that development does not negatively affect urban tree diversity and inform proactive strategies for urban trees to contribute to wider biodiversity conservation.																			1618-8667	1610-8167				2022 AUG	2022	74								127676	10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127676	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ufug.2022.127676		JUL 2022											WOS:000835299700002

Nematode communities in continuous tomato-cropping field soil infested by root-knot nematodes	ACTA AGRICULTURAE SCANDINAVICA SECTION B-SOIL AND PLANT SCIENCE												Soil nematode communities in greenhouses with different duration of continuous cropping were investigated from October 2007 to June 2008. Total nematode populations and trophic groups were observed. Fourteen families and 24 genera were identified; the genera Protorhabditis, Diploscapter, Meloidogyne and Helicotylenchus comprised 74.4% of the total population (from all tested samples). Plant-parasitic and bacterivorous nematodes were most abundant among the trophic groups. Populations of both trophic groups increased with increasing times of continuous cropping. The numbers of soil nematodes at different soil depths were significantly different (p < 0.05). Shannon-Wiener index (H') and Simpson index of diversity (D) were highest in 0-yr soil of all soils. Plant parasite index (PPI) and PPI/MI (maturity index) of soil nematodes increased with the increasing times of continuous cropping suggesting that continuous cropping resulted in gradual shift of plant-parasitic nematodes from k-strategists to r-strategists.

Macrobenthic fauna is responsible for efficient utilization of sediments and their diversity indicates health of a wetland in accordance to its sediment quality. In the present study, several physico-chemical parameters such as DO (3.03-11.06 ppm), CO2 (4.02-20.0 ppm), alkalinity (36.83-164.0 ppm), total hardness (100.0-270.00 ppm), TDS (450.0-620 ppm), chloride(142.0- 364.2 ppm), pH (7.3-8.5), water transparency (8.0-54.2 cm), organic contents like organic carbon (1.03-10.9mg g(-1))were studied. Variation in macrobenthic fauna from the selected fields were also examined by calculating Simpson's dominance index, evenness index (Pielou index), Shannon's diversity index. 12 taxa of mollusk and 1 taxa of annelid were found in the study and Bellamya and Thiara were the most dominant species which indicated clean water of the pond. The correlation between macrobenthic diversity and physico-chemical parameters were also studied in selected ponds from East Calcutta Wetlands.

The results showed that there were significant differences of the rate and extent in different types of carbon metabolism. The metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids and amines carbon were significantly better than other carbon sources in all microbial communities, while the metabolism of acid metabolite was poor. Through continuous multi-point measuring the diversity index of Shannon-wiener, Simpson and McIntosh, overall, the microbial diversity was good, but with the time passing, the functional diversity of the carbon metabolism decreased.

In this background, a study had been undertaken with the objective of understanding dietary habits with special reference to dietary diversity and nutritional status among rural population. The study is based on the primary data collected in Baghpat district of Uttar Pradesh during the year 2014-15. The body mass index, one of the indicator of nutrition status reveals about 10 per cent men, 20 per cent women, 30 per cent boys and 35 per cent girls were coming under underweight and remaining fell in overweight category. Nutrition awareness among the female groups was better than male groups and anganwadi workers were the key informants. The actual consumption of all the food groups were about 50 per cent less than the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) across all the categories. Home produced milk consumption was near to RDA and market depended pulses were more deficient in their consumption. The Individual Diet Diversity Score (IDDS) ranged from 7.6 to 8.0; womens' dietary diversity score was slightly less than men, similar was the case with children. Simpson Index of Dietary Diversity (SIDD) ranged from 0.69 to 0.77. As evidenced from this study, household production enhances food accessibility, hence, promotion of diversified cropping pattern could be a right strategy for enhancing nutritional security in rural areas. Further, this study suggests to target men as well women for sensitization and awareness programme about importance of food and nutrition to achieve nutritional security of all in particular women.																			0019-5022					JUN	2017	87	6					846	852																WOS:000404014800020

The lakes of different eutrophication levels (eutrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic) were investigated monthly during autumn 1998. All of the diversity indices calculated (Hurlbert's, Margalefs, Menhinick's, Shannon's, Simpson's, McNaughton's and Species Number) failed to distinguish between different levels of eutrophication. However, the use of similarity index based on presence-ab sence matrices of phytoplankton species proved its high efficiency for eutrophication studies in the lakes in central Sweden. The consideration of abundance, additionally to presence-absence data, was concluded not to be as efficient as only presence-absence matrices. We recommend the use of similarity index based on presence-absence matrices of phytoplankton species as a good tool for the assessment of the level of eutrophication in the lakes studied.

They are the common environmental indicators in agricultural landscape. Therefore, this study took Gongyi City, Henan Province, China, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, as the study area, to explore the impact of multi-scale landscape heterogeneity on soil fauna diversity and the response of soil fauna to it. Our results showed that patch types and degree of fragmentation in the study area increased significantly with the increase of spatial scale. The diversity indices of soil fauna in different habitats showed that the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson's diversity index, Pielou's evenness index, and Margalef richness index were the lowest in farmland habitat. Diversity indices of artificial forests were higher than those of natural forests. Diversity indices of soil fauna under different geomorphic conditions showed that Pielou's evenness index and Margalef richness index had significant differences under different geomorphic conditions (p < 0.05). The effects of multi-scale landscape heterogeneity on soil fauna diversity were different. In the 150 m buffer zone, soil fauna community composition and diversity indices were strongly correlated with patch richness index, patch richness density, and other landscape indices (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the contribution rate of landscape index to soil fauna community composition were 45.05%, 32.5%, and 42% in farmland, plantation, and natural forest, respectively. Therefore, the 150 m buffer zone could be used as the characteristic response scale of soil fauna diversity. The multi-scale interaction of landform, habitat, and landscape also had a significant impact on soil fauna diversity.

J	Parparov, A; Gal, G				Parparov, Arkadi; Gal, Gideon			The effects of changes in diversity on phytoplankton community metabolism	INLAND WATERS												Changes in composition of phytoplankton communities cause drastic changes in functioning of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, we hypothesized that the shifts in composition of the phytoplankton community of Lake Kinneret induced notable shifts in the relationship between primary production and decomposition of organic matter in the lake ecosystem. To test this, we created an approach based on a statistical analysis of long-term dynamics of diversity indices and their relationships with potential perturbations: changes in lake water level, nutrient loads, and annual average epilimnetic temperature. Biodiversity of the algal community was estimated using Simpson's Diversity Index and community-weighted mean trait value (functional diversity index). Specific community respiration and photosynthesis assimilation number were considered as the functional traits characterizing the role of phytoplankton in cycling organic matter. The observed temporal trends in the diversity indices provided estimates of the shift in the biotic community from large, relatively faster aerobic decomposing and slower photosynthesizing producers towards slower aerobic decomposing and faster photosynthesizing producers. These trends were confirmed by the results of direct determination of community respiration and (indirectly) by the reduced microbial activity in the epilimnetic waters of the lake.																			2044-2041	2044-205X				2022 OCT 2	2022	12	4					499	509		10.1080/20442041.2022.2040406	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/20442041.2022.2040406		JUN 2022											WOS:000808148800001

The results showed that the values of richness indices and diversity indices among different layers were the shrub layer, the arbor layer, and the herb layer from large to small. The values of Evenness index had significant difference among different layers. Richness index values had high significant difference among different cutting intensities, but other indices had not significant difference. Species evenness index variation, shrub layer species evenness and cutting strength is concave parabolic changes of tree layer, increase the degree of uniform linear cutting strength increases, and herb layer, by contrast, in the difference between different levels. Variability of these diversity indices was R > J > H > P or R > H > P > J among different layers and different cutting intensities. According to all species, the values of richness index and diversity index showed convex parabolic change with cutting intensities increasing, which reached the greatest with medium selective cutting 10 years later, but which was the smallest with clear cutting 10 years later. However, evenness index values were opposite. The stability of communities under different cutting intensities was examined with M. Godron. The results showed that the stability of communities was in unstable state with different intensities cutting 10 years later, and it is the greater to cutting intensities, the worse the stability was.																					978-7-81131-420-5				2009							80	85																WOS:000289266900012

Bacterial composition was dominated by Gammaproteobacteria and more specifically with members of Alteromonas, Vibrio, Pseudomonas, Tolumonas, Marinobacter, Pseudoalteromonas and novel uncultured bacteria. The Shannon-Weaver index (H), Simpson diversity index (D) and Equitability index (E) values showed that salterns can support a wide range of microbes during the pre-salt harvesting phase (3-4 % salinity) when compared to the salt harvesting phase (21-29 % salinity). Range-weighted richness (Rr) values indicated that solar salterns are habitable only by a limited group of microbes as they have medium richness, indicated by physico-chemical characteristics. Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCO) of the simulated study showed a variation in diversity at a large scale with increase in salinity. Solar salterns as well as the simulated tank showed more diversity during the pre-salt harvesting phase.

BIOLOGIA					27th Congress of the IAVS-Working-Group of the European-Vegetation-Survey	MAY 23-26, 2018	Wroclaw, POLAND					The relationship between the size of the particle fractions of the soil substrate and the diversity of the spontaneously developing vegetation was investigated on coal mine spoil heaps in Upper Silesia (Southern Poland). The analyses were based on 2567 research plots of developed spontaneous vegetation and their associated soil substrate samples collected from 112 coal mine spoil heaps. For each research plot the prevailing particle size fraction was determined (stones, gravel, sand, silt), the species composition and abundance was recorded and the species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), Simpson (C) and Evenness (E) indices were used to determine species diversity. From a total of 119 research plots (in all particle size fraction categories), the values of 15 physicochemical properties (pH, electrical conductivity, water holding capacity, moisture, carbon content, total N, available P, Mg and exchange cations Ca, Mg, K, Na, fine particles (%), gravel (%), stone (%)) were obtained to asses their impact on the floristic composition of vegetation patches using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA). Additionally, functional traits of the dominant species of each vegetation patch (life forms, life strategies and socio-ecological groups), were selected to analyse their relation to substrate texture. It was shown that the highest species richness and the highest values for Shannon-Wiener diversity index, as well as Simpson and Evenness indices, were obtained in plots formed on stones. Moreover, the greatest variation in the participation of species representing different habitats, life forms, and life strategies was found on gravelly substrates. Contrary to our expectations, the vegetation diversity (in terms of both species and their functional traits) was not highest in habitats with a high composition of fine size particles.

Does the severity of a forest fire modify the composition, diversity and structure of temperate forests in Jalisco?	REVISTA CHAPINGO SERIE CIENCIAS FORESTALES Y DEL AMBIENTE												Introduction: Forest fires are natural disturbances that influence structure, dynamics, performance, composition and diversity of species. Objective: To compare composition, structure and diversity of temperate forest vegetation affected by different levels of severity of a forest fire in Jalisco. Materials and methods: Composition, horizontal structure, importance value index (IVI), diameter class, diversity indexes of Shannon, Simpson, Margalef richness and Bray-Curtis similarity were evaluated in three regions (Bosque La Primavera and Sierra de Tapalpa and Sierra de Quila) of temperate forest with three levels of severity (no fire, moderate and extreme). Results: Twelve species from six families were recorded. Pinaceae and Fagaceae were the most dominant. Dominance ranged from 0.2 to 50 m(2).ha(-1) in moderate and extreme severity sites. Pinus devoniana recorded the highest IVI (71 %) in Sierra de Tapalpa. The highest number of trees was recorded in diameter class <= 30 cm. Diversity and richness indices showed significant differences (P < 0.05) for Sierra de Tapalpa and Sierra de Quila and among fire levels; the highest indices were recorded in sites of moderate severity. Tree composition similarity between regions was low (<33 %). Conclusions: Moderate severity of forest fire favored composition, structure and diversity of vegetation in temperate forests of Jalisco, indicating that the level of severity influences resilience of forest ecosystem communities.

J	Lessard, LM; Juvonen, J				Lessard, Leah M.; Juvonen, Jaana			Body Weight and Academic Achievement: The Role of Weight Diversity in Urban Middle Schools	SCHOOL PSYCHOLOGY												The current study was designed to examine one possible weight stigma-reduction mechanism: school-level weight diversity. It was hypothesized that greater weight diversity among same-sex peers at school would attenuate the negative association between weight and academic achievement. Across 26 urban public middle schools, 5,991 sixth-grade students (52% girls) were included: 12% African American/Black, 14% East/Southeast Asian, 30% Latino, 21% White, and 23% from other specific ethnic groups. Weight diversity was estimated as the likelihood that two randomly selected students would be from different weight categories, using Simpson's index. Standardized achievement test scores and grade point average (GPA) were used to assess academic achievement. Consistent with our contextual moderator hypothesis, high levels of weight diversity at school served a protective function. The negative association between body mass index (BMI) and achievement test scores, as well as GPA (girls only) was nonsignificant at schools with high levels of weight diversity. The study results offer a potential explanation for inconsistent findings regarding body weight and achievement, and a novel methodological approach to capture weight diversity in ways that provide new insights for school-based interventions.																			2578-4218	2578-4226				MAY	2019	34	3					253	260		10.1037/spq0000317	http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/spq0000317								30883159					WOS:000505679000001

Arafat Rahman; Latifa, Gulshan Ara			Appraisal of different attributes of fish community in Andharmanik River of coastal Bangladesh and socio-economic conditions of fishermen	HELIYON												The purpose of this study was to determine the fish species composition and appraise the status of fish diversity through sampling in six sample locations and to observe the socio economic conditions of the fishermen sur-rounding the river during the study period. There were 81 fish species found, classified into 13 orders, 40 families, and 69 genera. The most dominant order was Perciformes (55.42 %), followed by Clupeiformes (20.44 %), Cypriniformes (8.96 %), Siluriformes (8.13 %), and others (7.05%). To illustrate the species diversity, fish species richness and evenness in sampling areas, indices of fish community viz. Shannon-Wiener's Index (H), Simpson's Dominance Index (D), Simpson's Diversity Index (1-D), Margalef's Index (d) and Gibson's Evenness (euro) were used and 3.29-3.48, 0.05-0.069, 0.93-0.95, 6.88-8.43 and 0.39-0.49 respectively were the overall values of the indices. S1 station is significantly differ in species richness from the rest of the five stations (P < 0.05). The analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) displayed significant (P-value < 0.05) variations in fish community among sta-tions and months. In compliance with similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis, 35.8% similarities were observed among the fish species from different stations, while 59.36% similarities were detected among the fish species from different months. One species is critically endangered (CR), three species are nearly threatened, eight species are endangered (EN), and eight species are vulnerable among the 81 fish species recorded at various sampling locations. The socioeconomic conditions of fishermen were determined on the basis of a personal interview and focus group discussion. Unfair fishing practices as well as environmental instabilities such as reduced water volume, increased sedimentation, water abstraction, and pollution have ravaged fish habitat and diminished fish diversity over time. As a result, fish preservation in the Andharmanik River has become imperative, and an in-tegrated management plan should be designed and executed as soon as possible.

These three components sum up to one. Therefore, they can be used to portray the community structure in a ternary diagram.Since the identification of community-level patterns is an essential step to investigate the main drivers of species coexistence, the ternary diagram of functional diversity can be used to relate different facets of diversity to community assembly processes more exhaustively than looking only at one index at a time.The value of the proposed diversity decomposition is demonstrated by the analysis of actual abundance data on plant assemblages sampled in grazed and ungrazed grasslands in Tuscany (Central Italy).

J	Sullivan, TP; Wagner, RG; Pitt, DG; Lautenschlager, RA; Chen, DG				Sullivan, TP; Wagner, RG; Pitt, DG; Lautenschlager, RA; Chen, DG			Changes in diversity of plant and small mammal communities after herbicide application in sub-boreal spruce forest	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH												This study was designed to test the hypothesis that herbicide (glyphosate, active ingredient) application for conifer release would reduce species diversity (measured as richness, Simpson's index, and Shannon-Wiener index) of both plant and small mammal communities over a 5-year period in young sub-boreal spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm, x Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) forest. Four treated and four untreated (control) sites were studied near Prince George in central British Columbia, Canada. Crown volume index of shrub vegetation was reduced by herbicide application. Species richness of shrubs was reduced in the first year after treatment and remained lower on treated sites throughout the 5-year period. Both indices of shrub diversity, however, were not different over the 5 years. Herbicide treatment initially reduced crown volume index of herbaceous vegetation, but values quickly recovered to untreated levels by the second year after treatment. Herbaceous species diversity was not affected by herbicide treatment. Diversity of small mammal communities apparently was not affected by herbicide application. In general, diversity of plant and small mammal communities seemed to be maintained, and hence, these treatment sites may not lower overall diversity of a forested landscape. Silvicultural practices, such as conifer release with herbicides or alternative methods, may contribute to a diversity of stand structures and wildlife habitats if appropriately designed and implemented.

J	Ricotta, C				Ricotta, C			Additive partitioning of Rao's quadratic diversity: a hierarchical approach	ECOLOGICAL MODELLING												Ecologists have long recognized three different components of species diversity: alpha or within-community diversity (alpha), beta or between-community diversity (beta) and gamma or total species diversity in a region (gamma). In this framework, beta-diversity has been traditionally linked to the other diversity components through a multiplicative model so that it can be expressed as the ratio between gamma-diversity and average alpha-diversity in a set of plots. Yet, more recently, ecologists are starting to partition diversity using the lesser known approach that alpha- and beta-diversities sum to give the gamma-diversity. This additive diversity partitioning is based on the decomposition of concave diversity measures for which the total diversity in a pooled set of communities exceeds (or equals) the average diversity within communities. In this paper, first, I shortly revise additive diversity partitioning for traditional diversity measures that are computed from species relative abundances. Next, I show that, under some specific circumstances, the same model can be extended to Rao's quadratic entropy, a measure that combines species relative abundances and pairwise interspecies differences. Finally, in the framework of taxonomic diversity, Rao's quadratic entropy has another decomposition: the sum over the Simpson indices at all the taxonomic levels. Thus, I show that, combining both partitioning models, the contribution of each level in the taxonomic hierarchy to the alpha- beta- and gamma-diversity components of Rao's quadratic entropy is made explicit. The proposed diversity decomposition is illustrated with a worked example on data from a plant community on ultramatic soils in Tuscany (central Italy). (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the urban expansion effects on species diversity is essential for conservation biologists, urban planners, and policymakers to help design more practical and effective conservation strategies. Here, based on monthly bird survey data of 12 university campuses distributed in the center and the Xianlin university town of Nanjing city, we first compared the differences of the campuses bird species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices. Then, we analyzed the effects of a variety of landscape attributes on the campuses bird species richness. Unlike other studies, we also constructed a 2 km buffer area surrounding each campus and analyzed the effects of the landscape attributes of the buffer area on species richness. We found that bird species richness was higher in the campus of Xianlin compared to those in the center. Landscape attributes played an important role on bird species richness, especially for the determinants in the buffer area. Specifically, species richness, Shannon-Wiener, and Simpson indices increased with the increasing area of water and green space both within the campus and the buffer area. Not surprisingly, bird species richness and diversity were more affected by fragmentation of the buffer area, increasing with the aggregation index and decreasing with the splitting index. Our study emphasized that landscape attributes of both campuses and buffer areas determined bird species richness and diversity, offering several practical implications for urban biodiversity maintenance and eco-friendly urban planning.

They are abundant and important members of the vicinity of inland waters. This study was carried out at Benin - Owena Basin catchment, Igbara-Oke, Nigeria. Sampling was carried out at three water bodies within the catchment of Rivers Aro, Elemo and Owena Dam. The water bodies were selected based on types of water body and prevailing anthropogenic activities around their vicinity. Sampling of specimens was randomly carried out once a month from 9am-2 pm between June, 2017 and July, 2018. Odonata naiads were collected using Kick net. Species composition, distribution and richness of the study sites were calculated using diversity indices (Shannon-wiener, Simpson, Margalef, Evenness and Equitability). Monthly collections of odonates revealed that January 2018 had the highest number of species while the least was in April 2018. Two anisopterans, Neodythemis klingi and Orthetrum julia both with 30 individuals, were the dominant odonate species. Pseudagrion kersteni (19 individuals) was the dominant zygopteran while Africallagma subtle (2 individuals) was the least represented odonate in this study. From the diversity indices analyses, Owena Dam was the richest (Shannon (H`) = 3.12, Simpson = 0.9521, Margalef = 4.42). The site was also the best in terms of distribution and spread of odonate species (Equitability = 0.9693). Similarity in odonate community structure among the 3 study sites was determined using Jaccard Coefficient (Coefficient of Community: CC), The CC analysis showed Elemo Stream and Owena Dam as the sites with similar community structure; and the diversity indices revealed Owena Dam as the richest site with the best species distribution.

J	López, AS; López, GG; Espinoza, MDF				Salmeron Lopez, Arturo; Geada Lopez, Gretel; Fagilde Espinoza, Maria del Carmen			Proposal of an index for functional diversity. Application to a microphyll semi-deciduous forest in eastern Cuba	BOSQUE												Functional diversity has emerged as a relevant aspect in the ecosystem studies; several indexes have been used for its evaluation. However, these indexes have not considered the functional redundancy among species, even when its implication in forest resilience facing natural and anthropogenic disturbances have been recognized. In this study an index for functional diversity, considering functional redundancy, is proposed and applied to know changes in functional diversity types according to its disturbance responses, in sites under different disturbance levels, in a microphyll semi-deciduous forest. The probability theory was used to derive a functional biodiversity index from the Simpson biodiversity index. The sensitivity of the index in relation to changes in the individual, species and functional type number was analyzed and compared with other indexes proposed in literature. The less functional diversity value was found in highly disturbed sites, and the highest value in the less disturbed sites. Results confirmed that in less disturbed sites, individuals were more uniformly distributed inside the species and these inside the functional types, than those individuals found in highly disturbed areas; it confers the system a superior functional redundancy. It is concluded that the proposed index is, besides, a good reference of the resilience in a forest ecosystem, and the forest management oriented to keep the functional diversity, as it is interpreted, is a guaranty for the conservation of the forest resilience and integrity.

Ensemble Machine Learning for Mapping Tree Species Alpha-Diversity Using Multi-Source Satellite Data in an Ecuadorian Seasonally Dry Forest	REMOTE SENSING												The increased variety of satellite remote sensing platforms creates opportunities for estimating tropical forest diversity needed for environmental decision-making. As little as 10% of the original seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remains for Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. Remnant forests show high rates of species endemism, but experience degradation from climate change, wood-cutting, and livestock-grazing. Forest census data provide a vital resource for examining remote sensing methods to estimate diversity levels. We used spatially referenced trees >= 5 cm in diameter and simulated 0.10 ha plots measured from a 9 ha SDTF in southwestern Ecuador to compare machine learning (ML) models for six alpha-diversity indices. We developed 1 m tree canopy height and elevation models from stem mapped trees, at a scale conventionally derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR). We then used an ensemble ML approach comparing single-and combined-sensor models from RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and interpolated canopy height and topography surfaces. Validation data showed that combined models often outperformed single-sensor approaches. Combined sensor and model ensembles for tree species richness, Shannon's H, inverse Simpson's, unbiased Simpson's, and Fisher's alpha indices typically showed lower root mean squared error (RMSE) and increased goodness of fit (R-2). Pielou's J, a measure of evenness, was poorly predicted. Mapped tree species richness (R2 = 0.54, F = 27.3, p = < 0.001) and Shannon's H' (R-2 = 0.54, F = 26.9, p = < 0.001) showed the most favorable agreement with field validation observations (n = 25). Small-scale model experiments revealed essential relationships between dry forest tree diversity and data from multiple satellite sensors with repeated global coverage that can help guide larger-scale biodiversity mapping efforts.

Sapling plants as part of the undergrowth plants are an inseparable part of the forest ecosystem and play an important role in the sustainability of the forests, including forests in the tropics. We examine the structure and composition of sapling plants in Bantimurung Bulusaraung National Park, Balloci resort, in two areas, which are Bukit Batu Putih and Gunung Bulusaraung. This national park is one of the protected areas in Province of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Species with the highest importance value index in Bukit Batu Putih are Tabernaemontana sphaerocarpa, Homalium guianense, Micromelum minutum, Lepiniopsis ternatensis and Melicope lunu-ankenda with a total of 191.84%, while the lowest are Planchonella firma, Coffea sp., Matthaea sancta, Ficus pumila and Syzygium ingens with a total of 1.58%. Species in Gunung Bulusaraung with the highest important value index are Daemonorops longipes, Actephilla excelsa, Memecylon paniculatum, Galbulimina belgraveana and Ficus gul with a total of 126.31%, while the lowest are Arenga pinnata, Pterospermum celebicum, Ficus ampelas, Antidesma bunius and Cyathea contaminans with a total of 2.68%. The value of Shannon-wiener diversity, Simpson's diversity index, species richness, Pielou's evenness index, and Rarefaction in Bukit Batu Putih is lower than that of Gunung Bulusaraung and only Simpson's dominance index is higher indicating of lower species diversity in Bukit Putih area. The value of similarity index between Bukit Batu Putih and Gunung Bulusaraung is 23.71% indicating that these two areas have a high difference in the structure and composition of sapling plant vegetation.

Epiphytic macrolichens of the greater Cincinnati metropolitan area - Part II: distribution, diversity and urban ecology	BRYOLOGIST												The contributions of both biotic and abiotic factors to the "urban" effect on the ecology of epiphytic macrolichens of the greater Cincinnati, Ohio metropolitan area were evaluated. Abundance, as percent cover, and several diversity indices were used to evaluate the distribution of these lichens among urban and non-urban (both rural and suburban) sites. The measures of diversity examined in this study include species richness, the Shannon-Wiener index, evenness, Simpson's index and the Index of Atmospheric Purity (IAP). A significant difference in abundance and diversity among the eleven study sites was established. This significance was maintained when the sites were grouped into urban vs. non-urban classes. It was found that the diversity of the epiphytic lichens examined in this study was associated with tree species, tree size and annual vehicle traffic, but not with human population density of the study site, or side of the tree observed (cardinal direction). Finally a comparative review was performed of epiphytic urban lichens as reported in a sampling of published surveys from North America.

The results first showed that orchard and cropland land use significantly changed the distribution and diversity of soil microbes, particularly at surface soil layers. The richness index (S) and Shannon diversity index (H) of orchard soil microbes were significantly higher than the indices of the cropland and unused soil treatments in the 0-10 cm soil layer, while the S and H indices of cropland soil microbes were the highest in 10-20 cm soil layers. Additionally, the Simpson dominance index of cropland soil microbial communities was the highest across all soil layers. Next, we found that carbon source differences in soil layers under the three land use conditions can mainly be attributed to their carbohydrate and polymer composition, indicating that they are the primary cause of the functional differences in microbial communities under different land uses. In conclusion, orchard and cropland soil probably affected microbial distribution and functional diversity due to differences in vegetation cover, cultivation, and management measures.

Core and occasional species: A new way forward	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Various methods have been used to divide communities into core species and occasional or satellite species. Some methods are somewhat arbitrary, and there is evidence that many communities are more multimodal than bimodal. They also tend to rely on having multiple years of data. A completely novel method is presented that not only has no requirement for long-term datasets but can divide communities into multiple groups. It is based on probability a species is present, calculated using Simpson's index and the sequential removal of species from the data. The sequential Simpson's index method was applied to species data from a grassland insect community. It was also applied to eleven other datasets that had been divided into core and occasional species in previously published studies. The new method was found not only to be consistent with previous core-occasional assessments but also able to identify multimodality in species abundance distributions. Although ideally used with a measure of persistence (frequency of occurrence) to rank species, community structure is consistently described even with only species abundance data. The method can be applied to short or long-term datasets and can help identify multimodality and provide valuable insight into how communities change in time or space.

Breakthrough paper indicator 2.0: can geographical diversity and interdisciplinarity improve the accuracy of outstanding papers prediction?	SCIENTOMETRICS												We report progress on new developments in the breakthrough paper indicator, which allows early selection of a small group of publications which may become potential breakthrough candidates based on dynamics of publication citations and certain qualitative characteristics of citations. We used a quantitative approach to identify typical citation patterns of highly cited papers. Based on these analyses, we propose two forecasting models to select groups of breakthrough paper candidates that exceed high citation thresholds five years post-publication. Here we study whether interdisciplinarity in the subject categories or geographical diversity serve as possible measures to improve ranking of breakthrough paper candidates. We found that ranked geographical diversities of known breakthrough papers have equal or better ranks than corresponding citations ranks. This allows us to apply additional filtering for better identifications of breakthrough candidates. We studied several interdisciplinarity indices, including richness, Shannon index, Simpson index, and Rao-Stirling-Porter index. We did not find any correlations between citation ranks and ranked interdisciplinarity indices.

The fine root functional traits and rhizosphere soil environmental factors of 13 representative plants in the Bawangling tropical cloud forest of Hainan Island were measured, to assess the key factors driving plant rhizosphere microbial communities. Illumina MiSeq sequencing technology was used to sequence the v3-V4 region of the 16SrDNA gene of 13 plant rhizosphere soil bacteria and the ITS1 region of the fungal ITSrDNA gene. Results showed that there were 355 families, 638 genera, and 719 species of rhizosphere soil bacteria as well as 29 families, 31 genera, and 31 species of rhizosphere soil fungi in the tropical cloud forests. The fine root traits, such as root phosphorus content, the specific root length and specific root area, were significantly negatively correlated with the Faith-pd indices of the bacterial community but were not correlated with the diversity of fungi communities. The soil pH was significantly and positively correlated with the Chao1 index, OTUs, Faith-pd and Simpson indices of the bacteria and fungi communities. The soil available phosphorus content was significantly and negatively correlated with the bacteria Simpson and the fungus Faith-pd indices. ABT analysis showed that soil pH and soil available phosphorus were the most important environmental conditions contributing to the rhizosphere bacterial and fungi communities, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that the soil environments had more influence on rhizosphere soil microbial diversity than the fine root functional traits.																				1999-4907				MAR	2022	13	3							421	10.3390/f13030421	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f13030421													WOS:000775697600001

Here, we study the associations between nearby residential green space and residential indoor microbiota. Methods: We collected settled dust from 176 living rooms of participants of the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort. We performed 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing, and quantitative PCR measurements of total bacterial and fungal loads to calculate bacterial and fungal diversity measures (Chao1 richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices) and relative abundance of individual taxa. Green spaces were estimated within 50m and 100m buffers around the residential address. We defined total residential green space using high-resolution land-cover data, further stratified in low-growing (height<3m) and high-growing green (height>3m). We used land-use data to calculate the residential nature. We ran linear regression models, adjusting for confounders and other potential determinants. Results are expressed as units change for an interquartile range (IQR) increase in residential green space and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: After adjustment, we observed statistically significant associations between the indoor microbial diversity indices and nearby residential green space. For bacteria, the Shannon index was directly associated with residential nature (e.g. 0.08 units increase (CI:0.02,0.13) per IQR increase in nature within a 50m buffer). Fungal diversity was directly associated with high-growing residential green and inversely with low-growing green. For example, an IQR increase in high-growing green within a 50m buffer was associated with increases in 0.14 (CI:0.01,0.27) and 0.02 (CI:0.008,0.04) units in the Shannon and Simpson indices, respectively. Conclusions: Nearby green space determines the diversity of indoor environment microbiota, and the type of green differently impacts bacterial and fungal diversity. Further research is needed to investigate in more detail possible microbial taxa compositions underlying the observed changes in indoor microbiota diversity and to explore their contribution to beneficial health effects associated with green space exposure.

J	Shirazi, S; Khoshbakht, K; Mahmoudi, H				Shirazi, Somayeh; Khoshbakht, Kouros; Mahmoudi, Hossein			Local rice cultivar diversity and household food security in northern Iran	ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY												The world's population is constantly increasing and is expected to reach 8 billion by 2030. After wheat, rice is the second major crop in terms of acreage and food security. The major crop in the north of Iran is rice. The study of diversity in rice cultivars is an excellent predictor of food security. Rice monoculture is one of the major challenges to achieving basic self-sufficiency in ensuring sustainable food security in the country. The current study evaluated the relationship between rice cultivar diversity and food security in response to this challenge. In this study, 10 villages and 106 farms were randomly surveyed with interviews, direct observations, and focal group discussion. Logistic regression analysis showed the relationship between mean species richness, cultivar richness, and Shannon-Wiener index of rice and food security is positive and significant. From regression graphs, we can conclude that crop diversity indices, i.e., the Simpson index, have a negative relationship and average species richness, cultivar diversity index, and the Shannon-Wiener index have a positive relationship with food security. Therefore, we suggest focusing on formulating adaptation strategies and major training in the diversity of local rice cultivars to improve food security.

An investigation of the influence of habitat type on macroinvertebrates assemblages structure was conducted in July 2016. Nine (9) sampling sites were selected based on sediment type, water condition, and aquatic vegetation type. Macroinvertebrates attributes including density, biomass, and four diversity indices (Simpson diversity index, Margalef richness index, Shannon-Weiner index, and Pielou evenness index) were assessed. A total of 53 taxa were collected during the study period, with the highest density dominated being from aquatic insects and gastropods. Bellamya purificata and Exopalaemon annandalei were the most dominant among all the species. The results showed that the assemblages structure of macroinvertebrates in different habitats was significantly different. Also, the results with PCA showed that the higher values of invertebrates density, biomass, diversity indices, and species richness had a greater association with the habitat types of silt-humus sediment, closed lentic area, and submerged-flouting-emergent vegetation.					mahdi, Nagam Khudhair/S-7002-2017; KHUDHAIR, NAGAM/AFB-2458-2022	mahdi, Nagam Khudhair/0000-0001-6731-626X; 													2314-6133	2314-6141					2019	2019								2650678	10.1155/2019/2650678	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2019/2650678								30895190					WOS:000459658000001
J	KOLMER, JA				KOLMER, JA			PHENOTYPIC DIVERSITY IN 2 POPULATIONS OF PUCCINIA-RECONDITA F SP TRITICI IN CANADA DURING 1931-1987	PHYTOPATHOLOGY												The Canadian eastern and prairie populations of Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici from race surveys conducted during 1931-1987 were assessed for phenotypic diversity within each population and phenotypic overlap between the two populations using four different indexes based on infection type on the modified Unified Numeration differentials. The indexes showed that the two populations had similar levels of absolute diversity during 1931-1959. Diversity in the prairie population was consistently lower than in the eastern population during 1960-1975, increased during 1976-1984, and decreased during 1985-1987. Levels of phenotypic diversity in the eastern population changed relatively little from the initial years. The degree of phenotypic overlap as measured by the Rogers index was highest during 1931-1946, after which the two populations diverged phenotypically. The changes in phenotypic diversity in the prairie population could be attributed to the directional changes in race frequencies due to the use of resistant cultivars in this region. The diversity indexes were regressed on the variables' sample size, number of races, and evenness of race frequencies to determine the proportion of variation in the diversity indexes that could be accounted for by the independent variables. The Gleason index was the most sensitive to number of races; the Shannon and Simpson indexes were the most sensitive to evenness of race frequencies. In general, the three indexes of absolute diversity showed little variation due to sample size. Differences in absolute phenotypic diversity within, and phenotypic overlap among, the eastern, prairie, and Pacific populations of P. r. tritici in 1988 were enhanced by using the 12 differentials in the Prt nomenclature.																			0031-949X					MAR	1991	81	3					311	315		10.1094/Phyto-81-311	http://dx.doi.org/10.1094/Phyto-81-311													WOS:A1991FA21300014

A total of 23 fungal species belonging to 15 genera in seven families were recorded and identified. The Polyporaceae was the most dominant family, while Schizophyllum commune was the most abundant species among all species recorded. Other commonly observed fungal species were Daldinia concentrica, Trametes versicolor, Trametes coccinea and Flavodon flavus. The Simpson diversity index (0.93) and Shannon-Wiener index (2.90) showed a wide distribution of the wood-decay fungi in the study areas. The species diversity index (0.036), species evenness index (0.92) and species richness index (3.40) indicated a diverse distribution of the fungal species. Two-thirds of the identified fungal species showed significant preferences for their hosts. The host vulnerability was found to be significantly affected by storage facility, duration of storage, depot yard condition, treated or non-treated wood and shade facility. The findings of this work may help sawmill owners to utilize a scientific approach to management of logs and timber stored in depots, to minimize fungal decay before incurring any economic loss.

However, little is known about the role of this diversity in disease epidemics in areas where wheat yellow rust is an important disease in both irrigated and rain-fed wheat (i.e., in the plains of Pakistan). We explored the population diversity inP. striiformisduring the rust epidemics of 2013 in the major wheat-growing regions of Pakistan (the Himalayan region, central Khyber Pakhtunkhwa [KP], southern KP, central and northern Punjab). Disease severities among commonly grown cultivars ranged from 5% to 100%. Microsatellite genotyping with 16 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers revealed a high diversity among 266 isolates collected during the season, with the Simpson diversity index (Simpson 1949) ranging from 0.870 (Himalayan) to 0.955 (southern KP). The recombination signature was stronger in the Himalayan population and central KP compared with wheat-growing regions of Punjab and southern KP. The overall diversity was higher in Pakistan relative to the clonal populations present in Europe, Australia, and the Americas. Analyses of population subdivision revealed no clear evidence of spatial structure for samples from Pakistan, with a maximum fixation index (F-ST) value of only 0.10. The lack of clear population subdivision could be attributed to migration of pathogen. In turn, the high diversity ofP. striiformisin Pakistan represents a potential threat to wheat production in the region and worldwide, as a possible source to found clonal populations in diverse wheat-growing areas.

Diversity of Interactions: A Metric for Studies of Biodiversity	BIOTROPICA												Multitrophic interactions play key roles in the origin and maintenance of species diversity, and the study of these interactions has contributed to important theoretical advances in ecology and evolutionary biology. Nevertheless, most biodiversity inventories focus on static species lists, and prominent theories of diversity still ignore trophic interactions. The lack of a simple interaction metric that is analogous to species richness is one reason why diversity of interactions is not examined as a response or predictor variable in diversity studies. Using plant-herbivore-enemy trophic chains as an example, we develop a simple metric of diversity in which richness, diversity indices (e.g., Simpson's 1/D), and rarefaction diversity are calculated with links as the basic unit rather than species. Interactions include all two-link (herbivore-plant and enemy-herbivore) and three-link (enemy-herbivore-plant) chains found in a study unit. This metric is different from other indices, such as traditional diversity measures, connectivity and interaction diversity in food-web studies, and the diversity of interaction index in behavioral studies, and it is easier to compute. Using this approach to studying diversity provides novel insight into debates about neutrality and correlations between diversity, stability, productivity, and ecosystem services.

However, the regulation of abiotic factors on the aboveground biomass and diversity of plants on the slopes of coastal agricultural ditches remains unclear. In this study, the spatial distribution of soil physicochemical properties, aboveground biomass, and diversity of vegetation on different slope positions (upper slope, middle slope, and lower slope) and slope aspects (north-south direction) of farmland drainage ditches and their correlations were investigated through field surveys of vegetation on the slopes of coastal farmland drainage ditches at different sampling sites. First, water content and bulk density) decreased with the increase of slope position, while the salinity showed the opposite spatial distribution characteristics and the distribution of soil nutrients in space was mainly concentrated in the 0-20 cm soil layer. Second, the aboveground biomass of vegetation was significantly higher on the south slope than on the north slope, with the highest biomass at the lower slope on the south slope and higher aboveground biomass on the north slope at the upper and middle slopes. The Shannon-Wiener index, Pielou index, and Margalef index of ditch slope vegetation in Dongying and Binzhou farmland ditch slopes showed the same pattern of change at different slope positions and directions, which were significantly higher at the upper and middle slopes than at the lower slopes. In contrast, the Simpson index showed the opposite pattern, decreasing with the increase in slope position. Further, WC, BD, organic matter content, and total nitrogen content had positive effects on vegetation aboveground biomass, while soil pH, salinity, and available potassium content hindered vegetation growth. Finally, the Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou index were positively correlated with soil BD and available phosphorus content, and negatively correlated with organic matter and total nitrogen content, while the Simpson index was positively correlated with soil BD and WC, and had a significant negative correlation with soil salinity.																				2073-4441				NOV	2022	14	21							3547	10.3390/w14213547	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/w14213547													WOS:000884018700001

In a grasshopper assemblage in southeastern Brazil, preferences for escape places were detected; grasshoppers tended to escape to backgrounds in which they seem to be more cryptic. Coloration was measured using the Simpson diversity index, to quantify 'aspect diversity' (diversity of colours and shapes of patches along the insect's body). A weak positive correlation was found between grasshoppers' aspect diversity and diversification in use of escape places (use of many backgrounds to escape).

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of fertilization on soil microorganisms in mangrove wetlands from the perspective of functional diversity of soil microorganisms. The results showed that the application of fertilizer could enhance the utilization of carbon sources (average absorbance) and increase the functional diversity of microorganisms (Shannon index). The Shannon evenness and Simpson index of soil microorganisms changed under different fertilization treatments, but the difference was not significant. Clustering and principal component analysis showed that there were great differences in the utilization of carbon sources among different fertilization treatments, and different fertilization treatments aggravated the differentiation of soil microbial community to some extent. Soil microbial diversity is related to soil physical and chemical properties. In general, the content of carbon and nitrogen in soil has the greatest impact on the metabolic activity and biodiversity of soil microorganisms.																			1018-4619	1610-2304					2022	31	11					10793	10800																WOS:000892066900074

Among the tested indexes, the Margalef and the Simpson indexes were found to effectively characterize the ecological degree of water conservation facilities. Natural lake plant diversity has been used to as a metric; the ecological criteria degree of water conservation facilities can be divided into 4 grades. The results showed that the ecological level of the field ditch, primary furrow, and second furrow qualified as class A, which is the highest grade. The branch canal was grade B, which is good. The lateral canal and flood furrow were grade C, which is a medium level. The trunk canal was grade D, which is the poorest. In addition, the results establish an ecologicalization evaluation system based on the plant diversity composite index of the original lake.

Assessment of the Species Diversity of Ichthyoplankton in the Northern Part of the Central Eastern Atlantic	JOURNAL OF ICHTHYOLOGY												Based on the materials of long-term (2000-2019) studies of ichthyoplankton in the adjacent areas of the northern part of the Central Eastern Atlantic (exclusive economic zones of the northern and southern parts of Morocco and Mauritania), the species diversity of the ichthyoplankton has been studied using various indices that are widespread in ecological and faunistic research. A general trend towards an increase in the species diversity from the northern part of Morocco to the area of Mauritania has been revealed (the average values of the Margalef index increase from 4.63 to 7.02). The ichthyoplankton assemblages of the study areas are characterized by a medium and high biotic diversity (Simpson's index 0.22-0.90); different degrees of their monodominance are observed more often (in 25 of the 44 observations, Pielou's evenness index was less than 0.5) than the relatively equal abundance of all species. In the northern part of Morocco, similar trends have been revealed in the dynamics of diversity indices and abundance indices for European pilchard Sardina pilchardus at its early development stages; in the southern part of Morocco and in Mauritania, the trends in the diversity and abundance dynamics are similar in round sardinella Sardinella aurita. In the ichthyoplankton of the study areas, the dominant species is S. pilchardus and subdominant species are S. aurita, European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, and sparids (Sparidae).

Characterization of yeast population from unstudied natural sources in La Mancha region	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aims This study aims to identify the yeast species and strains which entitled an unstudied area of Spain and evaluate the yeast species diversity richness and the genetic variety. Methods and results A total of 702 yeasts were isolated from different environments in a central Spanish region (La Mancha) with diverse sources of origin (food, animals, flowers and environmental sources) during spring season. Thanks to the analysis carried out by the PCR-RFLP technique and sequencing, 35 species were identified. A neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree was created based on D1/D2 sequences. Moreover 330 strains were determined by PCR-RAPD and their profiles were analysed using the bioinformatics programme BioNumerics 7 center dot 6. The Simpson's index (D) and the genetic diversity percentage were calculated with the aim of studying the richness of the species in each environment and the genetic variety in each species. Conclusions This study has permitted to know that the majority of the species found wasDiutina rugosawhile the most ubiquitous wasRhodotorula mucilaginosawhich expose the dispersion capability of this species. The diversity parameters has revealed that the highest species richness was associated to environmental samples and the highest genetic variety was presented in those species with better dispersion capability or a smaller number of isolates. Significance and Impact of the Study This study permits to better understand the yeast communities in La Mancha region which gives a value the microbial potential of this region.

In order to enumerate the distribution of species, several diversity indices including Shannon-Winer Index, Pielou's Evenness and Simpson's Index were employed. A total of 645 species belonging to 414 genera under 120 families were documented from the studied area for the first time. Of these, 37 species (5.73%) are pteridophytes, 607 species (94.11%) are angiosperms and single representation of gymnosperm (0.16%). Among the recorded species, 384 are medicinal species belonging to 277 genera under 93 families. Bacopa monnieri is a dominant species in the forest area with some co-dominant species like Eichhornia crassipes, Centella asiatica, etc. Moreover, this study provides potential sources to the environmental planners, herbalists, ecologists, taxonomists, ethnobotanists, pharmacists, phytochemists and local administration that would help to plan for future green infrastructure and maintain ecosystem function providing long-term benefits for the city dwellers.																			1028-2092	2224-7297				DEC	2022	29	2					313	344		10.3329/bjpt.v29i2.63532	http://dx.doi.org/10.3329/bjpt.v29i2.63532													WOS:000906731100009
J	Delimat, A; Kieltyk, P				Delimat, Anna; Kieltyk, Piotr			Impact of troublesome expansive weed <i>Rumex alpinus</i> on species diversity of mountain pastures in Tatra National Park, Poland	BIOLOGIA												Alpine dock (Rumex alpinus) is a native plant species in many European mountain ranges. It comes from moist brushwood and open tall herb communities, though it has invaded mountain pastures. This troublesome weed forms permanent monodominant stands characterised by low nature conservation and agricultural values. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies assessing the impact of R. alpinus on invaded communities. Therefore, in this study we examined the potential effect of an R. alpinus on species richness, diversity and the composition of invaded vegetation in Tatra National Park, Poland. Invaded plots dominated by R. alpinus had, compared to uninvaded control plots, significantly reduced species richness, as well as low Shannon and Simpson diversity and Pielou evenness indices' values; the species richness decline in the pairs of invaded-uninvaded plots was as much as 37.7%. Analysing changes in diversity from an increase in R. alpinus coverage revealed that Shannon, Simpson and Pielou's diversity indices' values did not considerably change up to 30% of R. alpinus coverage, but a further increase in R. alpinus coverage led to a steep decline in diversity. There was exception in a number of species per plot, which decreased steadily along with the increase of R. alpinus coverage. Multivariate analysis indicated a significant shift in the composition of invaded plots in relation to uninvaded plots, resulting from the shared increase of more shadow-tolerant and higher soil base-, nutrient- and moist-demanding species.

The diversity indexes of Shannon and Simpson, and the similarity indexes of Sorensen and Morisita-Horn were applied. Eighty sample sites, 30x30m each, were established and density, riches, and diameter at breast height were measured. Forty seven species grouped in 23 families were found. Shannnon's diversity index showed significant differences when analyzed by site pairs at the Tapachula site, while the other three areas did not show significant statistical differences between pairs of sites. The floristic composition in the cacao plantations studied is similar among the different municipalities, as shown by the absence of statistical differences in the Sorensen index. The most frequent shadow species found were Mangifera indica and Pouteria sapota. This study found only one type of agro-forestry system at the cacao sites in the Soconusco region.

Installed in savannah, the orchards of +/- 20 years are maintained, whereas those of +/- 40 years are abandoned since more than one score of year. The inventory counts 24 species of which 21% are common to both batches of orchards. The respective average densities are of 94 +/- 3.46 trees.ha(-1) and 102 +/- 2 trees.ha(-1). The coefficients of similarity of Jaccard and Sorensen discriminate the two batches, whereas the diversity indexes of Shannon (0.79 +/- 0.38 and 0.93 +/- 0.02) and of Simpson (5.63 +/- 1.05 and 13.74 +/- 1.79), underline their weak diversification. As for the index of Pielou (0.42 +/- 0.17 and 0.46 +/- 0.02), it marks a predominance in the two batches of orchards.

Using entomological nets and light traps, 4,738 adult specimens were collected belonging to 50 families, 251 genera and 523 morphospecies. 80.5% of the specimens were collected with light traps. Diversity of order 1 (exponential of the Shannon index) reached a value of 153.32 effective species while diversity of order 2 (inverse of the Simpson index) was 68.30 effective species. According to the Chao1 and ACE estimates, the expected richness is 903 and 844 morphospecies, respectively (our sampling representing between 57.9% and 61.9%). The similarity between the sites was higher in those where light traps were used, because these insects were attracted by the artificial light.

In our paper we compared two main field survey approaches for forest vegetation recording, the Chinese and the European ("phyto-sociological") one, for their differences and efficiency when applied to the plant communities of temperate forests. The Chinese approach uses a design with different plot sizes for recording the tree, shrub and herb layer species, respectively, while the European one uses the same plot size for recording all layers and species. The two approaches result in significant differences in species richness (Simpson's diversity index and the Shannon-Wiener index), while there is no difference in the evenness index. The European approach has the ability to survey the number of different species more precisely than the Chinese one. For detecting the general patterns of diversity, however, the two approaches have the same ability, demonstrated here for the altitudinal gradient.

However, the data on the association of these disorders with the PCOS phenotype remain controversial. The objectives of this study were to estimate the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota of healthy women and PCOS patients depending on phenotype. The study participants (184 premenopausal women: 63 with PCOS, 121 without PCOS) were recruited during the annual employment assessment in the Irkutsk Region and the Buryat Republic (Russia) in 2016-2019. For PCOS diagnosis, we used the Rotterdam (2003) criteria and definitions of PCOS phenotypes. Five indexes of alpha diversity (ASV, Shannon, Simpson, Chao, and ACE) were estimated for the gut microbiota in all participants using amplicon metasequencing. As a result, two out of five alpha diversity indexes showed a statistical difference between the non-PCOS and PCOS groups. We did not find a significant difference in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota in the subgroups of women with hyperandrogenic PCOS phenotypes vs non-androgenic phenotype D and the group of women with the presence of only one of the PCOS criteria. Nevertheless, "classic" PCOS phenotypes demonstrated the most significant decrease in alpha diversity compared with healthy women without any signs of PCOS.

The objectives of this study were to define how long the soil material must remain in the Berlese-Tullgren extraction device to capture organisms of the mesofauna and determine the minimum extraction time for correct use of the Shannon, Simpson, Pielou, and Margalef indices used to evaluate the diversity, dominance, and richness of the mesofauna communities. The study was conducted at the Department of Soil Science at the Institute of Agronomy of the Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, Seropedica, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in highly anthropic land. Experimental plots were set up with the following treatments: jack bean (Canavalia ensiformis), velvet bean (Mucuna aterrima), Ceara bravo bean (Canavalia brasiliensis), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), and spontaneous vegetation in a Latin square design. Samples were collected from each of the experimental units, made up of plant litter and soil material in the first 5 cm of topsoil the day before planting legumes (October), and, subsequently, at the time of cutting plant shoots (March). The samples were subjected to a battery of the Berlese-Tullgren type funnels for a period of 15 days, performing a daily count of organisms. From the count and group-level identification (Order/Family) of the captured organisms, the Margalef, Simpson, Shannon, and Pielou indices were determined and verified by Kendall rank correlation between the values obtained from one day to the next until the 8th day of extraction, using the Shannon index as a reference. From the study, it may be concluded that it is possible to reduce the time the material samples remain in the Berlese-Tullgren funnels, but adoption of a time less than six days is not recommended to determine the composition of the soil mesofauna or to obtain more consistent and reliable data for evaluating diversity indices when using this procedure.					berbara, ricardo l/AAE-4318-2020; Berbara, Ricardo Luis Louro/F-6672-2012	berbara, ricardo l/0000-0002-9133-7754; Berbara, Ricardo Luis Louro/0000-0002-3649-9443													0100-0683					SEP-OCT	2015	39	5					1282	1291		10.1590/01000683rbcs20150117	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/01000683rbcs20150117													WOS:000366668000005

INVASION ON VASCULAR PLANT DIVERSITY IN POTHWAR REGION (PAKISTAN)	ANNALI DI BOTANICA												Studies on the impacts of alien plants help to understand extent of biological invasion. Multiple analyses of diversity parameters at different locations allow general explanations of impact on species diversity and richness in plant communities. The current study assessed impact of Xanthium strumarium invasion on native plant diversity in Pothwar region of Pakistan. The approach used for study was random samplings with two categorical factors: invaded and non-invaded plots under same habitat conditions. Differences in species frequency (N), species richness (R), evenness (J'), Shannon diversity index (H') and Simpson index of dominance (lambda) were compared between invaded and control plots by t-test series. Control plots harbored by average 1.3 more species/10m(2). The control category was more diverse (H'=2.00) than invaded category (H'=1.82). Non-invaded plots showed a higher floristic richness than invaded ones. At multivariate scale, ordination (nMDS) and ANOSIM showed significant magnitude of differences between invaded and control plots. The decrease in diversity indices in invaded over control sites indicated that plant communities become less biodiverse due to Xanthium strumarium invasion. This makes X. strumarium a candidate of consideration for appropriate control measures.

Microbial response to repeated treatments of manure containing sulfadiazine and chlortetracycline in soil	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES												Substantive addition of antibiotic-contaminated manure to agricultural soil may lead to "persistent" residues of antibiotics and may affect soil health. Therefore, this study examines the effects of repeated manure treatments containing sulfadiazine (SDZ) and chlortetracycline (CTC) residues, both individually and combined, on the functional diversity and structure of soil microbial communities in the soils under laboratory conditions. The average well color development (AWCD), Simpson diversity index (1/D, dominant populations), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H', richness), and McIntosh diversity index (U, evenness) in the antibiotics-treated soils decreased in the first 60-day treatment and then gradually recovered or even exceeded the initial level in the unamended soils with increasing treatment frequency. A total of 11 specific bands in temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) profiles were observed and sequence analyzed for five repeated treatments, and most of them belonged to the phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. These results indicate that repeated treatments of manure containing SDZ and CTC residues can alter soil microbial community structure, although they have a temporary suppression effect on soil microbial functional diversity.

Previous studies have indicated that a variety of neurological diseases cause changes in the gut microbiota. Alpha diversity is a major indicator to describe the diversity of the gut microbiota. At present, the relationship between neurological diseases and the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota remains unclear. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search of Pubmed and Bioproject databases up to January 2021. Six indices were used to measure alpha diversity, including community richness (observed species, Chao1 and ACE), community diversity (Shannon, Simpson), and phylogenetic diversity (PD). Random-effects meta-analyses on the standardized mean difference (SMD) were carried out on the alpha diversity indices. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the sources of interstudy heterogeneity. Meta-analysis was performed on articles by matching the age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) of the disease group with the control group. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis was performed to control the variability of the sequencing region, platform, geographical region, instrument, and diseases. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to assess the prediction effectiveness of the microbial alpha diversity indices. Results: We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 published studies on 16S rRNA gene amplified sequencing of the gut microbiota and neurological diseases from the Pubmed and Bioproject database (patients, n = 1,469; controls, n = 1,289). The pooled estimate demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the alpha diversity between patients and controls (P < 0.05). Alpha diversity decreased only in Parkinson's disease patients, while it increased in anorexia nervosa patients compared to controls. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and geographical region, none of the alpha diversity was associated with neurological diseases. In terms of Illumina HiSeq 2000 and the V3-V5 sequencing region, the results showed that alpha diversity increased significantly in comparison with the controls, while decreased in Illumina HiSeq 2500. ROC curves suggested that alpha diversity could be used as a biomarker to predict the AD (Simpson, AUC= 0.769, P = 0.0001), MS (observed species, AUC= 0.737, P = 0.001), schizophrenia (Chao1, AUC = 0.739, P = 0.002).

We investigated the potential of the so called spectral variability hypothesis (SVH) in linking field-collected and remote-sensed data in Mediterranean coastal dunes and explored if spectral diversity provides reliable information to monitor floristic diversity, as well as the consistency of such information in altered ecosystems due to plant invasions. We analyzed alpha diversity and beta diversity, integrating floristic field and Remote-Sensing PlanetScope data in the Tyrrhenian coast (Central Italy). We explored the relationship among alpha field diversity (species richness, Shannon index, inverse Simpson index) and spectral variability (distance from the spectral centroid index) through linear regressions. For beta diversity, we implemented a distance decay model (DDM) relating field pairwise (Jaccard similarities index, Bray-Curtis similarities index) and spectral pairwise (Euclidean distance) measures. We observed a positive relationship between alpha diversity and spectral heterogeneity with richness reporting the higher R score. As for DDM, we found a significant relationship between Bray-Curtis floristic similarity and Euclidean spectral distance. We provided a first assessment of the relationship between floristic and spectral RS diversity in Mediterranean coastal dune habitats (i.e., natural or invaded). SVH provided evidence about the potential of RS for estimating diversity in complex and dynamic landscapes.					Acosta, Alicia T.

Quantifying division of labor: borrowing tools from sociology, sociobiology, information theory, landscape ecology, and biogeography	INSECTES SOCIAUX												How do we quantify division of labor? We review several fields (sociology, landscape ecology, statistics, information theory, and biogeography) that have been cognizant of these questions and been somewhat successful at answering them. We review fourteen indices for quantifying division of labor, sensu lato, which can be categorized into four families: Shannon's index/entropy, Simpson's index, geometric mean, and standard/absolute deviation (including coefficients of variation). We argue that those indices using matrix inputs will simultaneously quantify the interplay between all individuals and all tasks and will thus best capture the essence of division of labor.

As a common index for all levels, we suggest Shannon's H-S, already used in information theory and biodiversity of ecological communities. Since Lewontin's first use of this index to describe human genetic variation, it has been used for variation of viruses, splice-junctions, and informativeness of pedigrees. However, until now there has been no theory to predict expected values of this index under given genetic and demographic conditions. We present a new null theory for H-S at the genetic level, and show that this index has advantages including (i) independence of measures at each hierarchical level of organization; (ii) robust estimation of genetic exchange over a wide range of conditions; (iii) ability to incorporate information on population size; and (iv) explicit relationship to standard statistical tests. Utilization of this index in conjunction with other existing indices offers powerful insights into genetic processes. Our genetic theory is also extendible to the ecological community level, and thus can aid the comparison and integration of diversity at the genetic and community levels, including the need for measures of community diversity that incorporate the genetic differentiation between species.

However, there are few reports of alterations of in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. Stool samples of each treatment-naive AML patient were collected the day before initiation of induction chemotherapy (pretreatment), on the first date of neutropenic fever and first date of bone marrow recovery. Bacterial DNA was extracted from stool samples and bacterial 16s ribosomal RNA genes were sequenced by next-generation sequencing. Relative abundance, overall richness, Shannon's diversity index and Simpson's diversity index were calculated. No antimicrobial prophylaxis was in placed in all participants. Ten cases of AML patients (4 male and 6 female) were included with a median age of 39 years (range: 19-49) and all of patients developed febrile neutropenia. Firmicutes dominated during the period of neutropenic fever, subsequently declining after bone marrow recovery a pattern in contrast to that shown by Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria. Enterococcus was more abundant in the febrile neutropenia period compared to pretreatment (mean difference +20.2; p < 0.0001) while Escherichia notably declined during the same period (mean difference -11.2; p = 0.0064). At the operational taxonomic unit (OTU) level, there was a significantly higher level of overall richness in the pretreatment period than in the febrile neutropenic episode (mean OTU of 203.1 vs. 131.7; p = 0.012). Both of the diversity indexes of Shannon and Simpson showed a significant decrease during the febrile neutropenic period. Adult AML patients with a first episode of febrile neutropenia after initial intensive chemotherapy demonstrated a significant decrease in gut microbiota diversity and the level of diversity remained constant despite recovery of bone marrow.

Spiders were sampled every two weeks over three months during the dry season and three months during the rainy season in 2000. Spider alpha diversity was analyzed using Shannon and Simpson indices. We also used the Cody index for beta diversity and cluster analysis for analyzing changes in species abundance hierarchies. 2261 individuals were collected (including juveniles and adults) representing 20 families, 56 genera and 97 species. In most cases the alpha diversity indices showed no relation between management gradient and spider diversity. When compared across seasons, spider diversity differed significantly only in organic management. Species turnover among the three sites (Cody index) was highest between the two coffee farms but not so clearly in the dry vs. rainy season; the conventional management shared the fewest species with the forest. Cluster analysis showed changes in abundance hierarchy related to management type. Our results did not support the proposed hypothesis of a direct positive correlation between management gradient and alpha spider diversity. In contrast, beta diversity showed that management and seasons influenced species composition.

A total of 1668 individual trees with diameter at breast height (DBH) of 5 cm and above were found in the 25 plots in Sungai Udang Forest Reserve, Malacca, Peninsular Malaysia of which overall floristic composition consisted of 85 species belonging to 79 genera and 38 families. The most abundant family is the Euphorbiaceae with 224 individual trees, followed by Myrtaceae and Anacardiaceae representing 212 and 197 individuals, respectively. Based on the calculated Importance Value Index ( IVi), Spondias cytherea (Anacardiaceae) was the most important species in the study area with an importance value index (IVi) of 23.9%. The second most important species in the study area was Syzygium sp. (Myrtaceae) with an importance value index (IVi) of 22.8%, followed by Elateriospermum tapos (Euphorbiaceae) and Aquilaria malaccensis (Thymelaeaceae) with an importance value index (IVi) of 17.2% and 13.0%, respectively. As for species diversity, the ShannonWeiner Diversity Index (H') for the whole 25 plots of the study area showed an index value of 3.67, while the Simpson's index of diversity (1-D) for the whole 25 plots showed an index value of 0.96. The H' values and D values proved that the study plots are considered as obtaining a fairly high species diversity in comparison with many studies conducted at the tropical rainforests in Peninsular Malaysia.

Samples were collected directly from a professional fishing boat caught by different nets, traps and hooks from January 2019 to December 2019. Together with 4 exotic species, a total of 49 species under 6 families were recorded. Though a biodiversity index of 3.65854 and a dominance index of 0.030929 represent the richness of ichthyo-diversity within the river, Synbranchiformes and Tetraodontiformes were not reported throughout the study period. Linear regression analysis showed a positive correlation between water height of the river and monthly abundance of the species found. Catch composition of catfishes and snakeheads slumped while barbs showed triumph over previous findings. A majority of fish recorded were within the least concern category according to IUCN (2015) but portions also belonged to critically endangered, endangered, and vulnerable categories as well. Therefore, conservation measures must be infixed in the Old Brahmaputra river to hold the fish diversity in a sustainable state.

In this study, to determine the diversity index values of species caught by purse seine, all samplings were carried out between September 2, 2017, and April 6, 2018 in Izmir Bay. As a result, a total of 17 fish species (Osteichthyes) belonging to 11 families and also 2 species from invertebrates (Cephalopoda and Arthropoda) were determined. Bony fishes and invertebrates consist of 99.9% and 0.1% of the total biomass, respectively. Sardina pilchardus was the most dominated species that occupied as 80.2% of the overall bony fishes followed by Engraulis encrasicolus (14.6%) and Sardinella aurita (1.5%). Diversity index values of species were found-1.026 by Shannon-Weaver and 0.63 by Simpsons, respectively. The highest dominancy was found for S. pilchardus with 71.1%. Overall final results indicate that the diversity of species in Izmir Bay purse seine fishery is very low and also S. pilchardus is the most over-dominant species.

J	Williams, VL; Witkowski, ETF; Balkwill, K				Williams, VL; Witkowski, ETF; Balkwill, K			Application of diversity indices to appraise plant availability in the traditional medicinal markets of Johannesburg, South Africa	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												The lack of scientific rigour in analysing ethnobotanical surveys has prompted researchers to investigate ways of quantitatively describing their data, including the use of ecological diversity indices. There are numerous indices and measures available to describe sample diversity. Twenty-two measures of species richness, diversity and evenness were reviewed using six sets of ethnomedicinal data derived from 50 formal muti shop traders (of different ethnicities) and 100 informal street traders of traditional medicine in Johannesburg, South Africa, and a seventh data set from traders on the western boundary of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The diversity measures were coupled with species accumulation curves to construct cumulative diversity curves used to determine the minimum viable sample size on which a diversity index should be based, and to better understand the differences in the relative diversities of the samples. Distinct differences in the relative abundance and diversity of plants sold by street traders and shop traders were evident. Species diversity and evenness was found to be higher in shops, thus resulting in a lower dominance in the sale of certain plant species compared to the street traders. A survey of an informal market should include no less than 35 research participants compared to no less than 20 for the muti shops. The use of selected indices of species richness (Margalef's), diversity (Shannon, Simpson's, Fisher's alpha, Hill's numbers) and evenness are recommended as a means of describing patterns exhibited within ethnobotanical data.

ODONATA AS INDICATORS OF RIVERINE HABITATS IN CENTRAL GREECE	FRESENIUS ENVIRONMENTAL BULLETIN												Riverine ecosystems offer many valuable services to human societies. Easy-to-use, reliable, inexpensive and efficient assessment and monitoring methods that investigate ecosystem integrity need to be developed for their conservation and protection. Such tools are the bio-indicators, with many recommending the Odonata (dragonflies) as a very appropriate indicator. This study is the first attempt to evaluate the potential of utilizing diversity indices on Odonata species for riverine habitats in Greece. The studied areas were along Sperchios River, Thermopyles spring and Kakavorema stream, located in Sperchios River Basin (Central Greece). The analysis based on the number of different species and three diversity indices, found differences among the three habitats. Sperchios River had the highest biodiversity and Thermopyles spring the lowest. This was also indicated by the water quality parameters and riparian area widths measured. Overall the differences found in these three habitats indicate the potential usefulness of Odonata for evaluating riverine habitats in Greece and the Balkans.

The degradation half-live of chlorpyrifos at levels of 4, 8, and 12 mg/kg in soil were calculated to be 14.3, 16.7, and 18.0 d, respectively. The Biolog study showed that the average well color development (AWCD) in soils was significantly (P < 0.05) inhibited by chlorpyrifos within the first two weeks and thereafter recovered to a similar level as the control. A similar variation in the diversity indices (Simpson index 1/D and McIntosh index U) was observed, but no significant difference among the values of the Shannon-Wiener index H' was found in chlorpyrifos-treated soils. With an increasing chlorpyrifos concentration, the half-life of chlorpyrifos was significantly (P < 0.05) extended and its inhibitory effect on soil microorganisms was aggravated. It is concluded that chlorpyrifos residues in soil had a temporary or short-term inhibitory effect on soil microbial functional diversity.

Our hypothesis was tested in a deciduous broad-leaf and a coniferous-broad-leaf mixedwood stand in the warm temperate region in China. We measured soil respiration and indices of tree species diversity including species richness (S), the Berger-Parker index (d), the Simpson index (lambda), the Shannon index (H-e'), and the Pielou evenness index (J(e)). Our results generally confirm our hypothesis that Q(10) was positively correlated to lambda, but negatively related to H-e', d, and J(e), and independent of S, in both stands. However, R-s was independent of the diversity indices. These findings imply that tree species diversity promotes soil carbon stability by depressing the Q(10). Furthermore, different biotic and abiotic variables explained the variations of species diversity and Q(10) in the broad-leaf and mixedwood forests, suggesting that the mechanisms underlining the effects of tree species diversity on Q(10) are different between the two forest types. We conclude that sustainable forest management that improves tree species diversity will increase soil carbon stability and benefit our efforts to mitigate climate change. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we assessed the contribution of these drivers and how they affect the vascular plant richness of different functional groups in a temperate forest ecosystem in Northeast China. We investigated about 0.986 million plants from 3160 sites to quantify the impact of annual mean temperature, sunshine duration, annual precipitation, standard deviation of diameter at breast height, and forest type on richness of vascular plants (total species, tree, treelet, shrub, and herb, separately) using the gradient boosting model. The results show that annual mean temperature had the strongest impact on plant richness. The tree richness peaked at intermediate annual mean temperature and sunshine duration and increased with annual precipitation. The Shannon diversity index and Simpson dominance index increased with annual precipitation and standard deviation of diameter at breast height, decreased with sunshine duration, and peaked at intermediate annual mean temperature and forest type. The total richness and understory richness increased with annual mean temperature and standard deviation of diameter at breast height and peaked at intermediate sunshine duration and annual precipitation. A comprehensive mechanism was found to regulate the plant diversity in forest ecosystems. The relationship between tree richness and annual mean temperature with latitudinal effect could be affected by the differences in number and size of tree individuals, indicating that plant diversity varies with the utilization of energy. The force driving plant richness varied with the functional group due to the different environmental resource requirements and the life history strategies of plants layers.					yan, xiao/JVP-0766-2024; wang, wenjie/G-9041-2014; Geng, Shicong/B-5685-2011	wang, wenjie/0000-0003-0465-686X; 														1999-4907				FEB	2020	11	2							227	10.3390/f11020227	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f11020227													WOS:000519236600041

Epigenetics of the molecular clock and bacterial diversity in bipolar disorder	PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY												Objectives The gut microbiome harbors substantially more genetic material than our body cells and has an impact on a huge variety of physiological mechanisms including the production of neurotransmitters and the interaction with brain functions through the gut-brain-axis. Products of microbiota can affect methylation according to preclinical studies. The current investigation aimed at analyzing the correlation between gut microbiome diversity and the methylation of the clock gene ARNTL in individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BD). Methods Genomic DNA was isolated from fasting blood of study participants with BD (n = 32). The methylation analysis of the ARNTL CG site cg05733463 was performed by bisulfite treatment of genomic DNA with the Epitect kit, PCR and pyrosequencing. Additionally, DNA was extracted from stool samples and subjected to 16S rRNA sequencing. QIIME was used to analyze microbiome data. Results Methylation status of the ARNTL CpG position cg05733463 correlated significantly with bacterial diversity (Simpson index: r=-0.389, p=0.0238) and evenness (Simpson evenness index: r=-0.358, p=0.044). Furthermore, bacterial diversity differed significantly between euthymia and depression (F(1,30) =4.695, p=0.039). Discussion The results of our pilot study show that bacterial diversity differs between euthymia and depression. Interestingly, gut microbiome diversity and evenness correlate negatively with methylation of ARNTL, which is known to regulate monoamine oxidase A transcription. We propose that alterations in overall diversity of the gut microbiome represent an internal environmental factor that has an epigenetic impact on the clock gene ARNTL which is thought to be involved in BD pathogenesis.

J	Kobayashi, T; Sanderson, BG; Gordon, GNG				Kobayashi, T; Sanderson, BG; Gordon, GNG			A phytoplankton community in a temperate reservoir in New South Wales, Australia: relationships between similarity and diversity indices and measures of hydrological disturbance	MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH												Temporal changes in diversity and similarity of a phytoplankton community were investigated in relation to external hydrological disturbance in the Ben Chifley reservoir from September 1998 to January 2002. Species richness varied by a factor of 4-5 at each of three sites studied during the period (n = 53 at each site). Species diversity (measured using Simpson's D and Shannon-Wiener's H, based on primarily genus or species number and cell densities) varied by a factor of 8-10, whereas similarity between two consecutive sampling dates (measured using Hurlbert's index and Pinkham and Pearson's B) varied by a factor of 10-46. When diversity was measured with H, it had an approximate quadratic (convex) relationship with similarity, as measured with Hurlbert's index. However, diversity was seldom related to external hydrological disturbance (measured as intensity and variability of daily inflow rates between two consecutive sampling dates). Similarity was significantly and negatively related to disturbance variability. These results suggest that the mechanisms that regulate diversity and similarity may differ from each other, and question the usefulness of observed approximate quadratic relationships between similarity and diversity indices when assessing the effect of disturbance on diversity. Such relationships may therefore not provide support for Connell's (1978) intermediate disturbance hypothesis.

We compared the arthropod communities in the early season (Apr-Jul) crop to those in the late season (Aug-Nov) crop in 2009. The comparisons were undertaken using a combination of community assessment approaches, including morphospecies richness, the Shannon-Weaver diversity index, H', the Pielou-evenness index, J, the Simpson dominance index C, the Jaccard similarity index q and the compositions of the sub communities. We collected 114 species of arthropods, which consisted of including 58 species of spiders, 16 species of predatory insects, 25 species of phytophagous insects, 15 species of neutral/other insects, in early season crop. Subsequently we collected 109 species of arthropods, which consisted of 50 species of spiders, 19 species of predatory insects, 24 species of phytophagous insects, and 16 species of neutral/other insects, in the late season crop. There were no significant differences (P < 0.05) between the arthropod communities of the early and late season rice crops with respect to the Shannon-Weaver diversity index, the Pielou evenness index and the Simpson dominance index. Moreover the Jaccard similarity index in early and late season rice was as high, i.e., 0.70. The spider sub community had the greatest number of species in both rice crops, but the phytophagous insect sub community had the largest number of individuals in both rice crops. The dominance of predatory insects in the early season rice crop was significantly lower (P < 0.05) than in late season crop, but there was no significant difference in the composition of the neutral/other subcommunity between the early and late season rice crops.																			0015-4040					MAR	2013	96	1					1	9		10.1653/024.096.0101	http://dx.doi.org/10.1653/024.096.0101													WOS:000317379200001

Protozoa and rotifers were the most abundant species recorded. The following fifteen species were common to all four reservoirs: six protozoan species, four rotifer species, three cladoceran species and two copepod species (accounting for 40.0%, 26.7%, 20.0%, and 13.3% of the species common to all of the reservoirs, respectively). Zooplankton diversity was significantly higher (p < 0.01) in the Jinshahe reservoir than in the remaining three reservoirs, with a Shannon-Wiener index (H) of 2.99 and a Simpson index (d) of 5.16. Zooplankton diversity in the Daoguanhe reservoir was the lowest of the four reservoirs (H = 1.80, d = 2.48); higher values were obtained for the Xujiahe (H = 2.08, d = 3.58) and Taoyuanhe (H = 2.07, d = 3.72) reservoirs. The Simpson indices of the Xujiahe and Taoyuanhe were significantly different from those of the Daoguanhe (all p < 0.05). Protozoan and rotiferan biomasses were significantly positively correlated with COD, TN and TP (p < 0.01) and significantly negatively correlated with DO (p < 0.01). The cladoceran and copepod densities were low and highly variable, and they were not significantly correlated with COD, DO, TN or TP. The dominant species density was significantly correlated with zooplankton density. Zooplankton abundance was significantly negatively correlated with phytoplankton abundance in the Jinshahe but positively correlated in the Daoguanhe (correlation coefficient r = 0.45); no significant correlations were observed in the remaining two reservoirs.																			1951-6851		978-90-78677-77-2				2013	31						566	572																WOS:000327762300137

These techniques were compared with other fingerprinting techniques, random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and Ouchterlony double diffusion (ODD), previously used to type this pathogen. Where possible, data were represented as dendrograms and groups/subgroups of strains identified. Simpson's index of diversity (Simpson's D) was used to compare groupings obtained with the different techniques which, with the exception of Biolog, gave values of 0.46 (RFLP), 0.39 (ERIC), 0.83 (phage typng), 0.82 (RAPD) and 0.26 (ODD). Of the techniques tested, phage typing showed the highest level of diversity within Eca, and this technique will now form the basis of studies into the epidemiology of blackleg disease.

But human intervention accompanied with some natural factors has deteriorated the quality of these habitats. Present study aims to assess the status of avifaunal habitability of 21 floodplain wetlands, interspersed over the lower part of the Ganges delta by using Avifaunal Habitability Index (AHI). Seven widely used Ecological Indicators namely Avifauna Density, Total numbers of Avifauna, Simpson Index of Species Dominance, Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index, Species Richness, Simpsons Reciprocal Index, and Shannon Evenness Index have been used to compute AHI. The result unveils that wetlands like Purbasthali (11.58), Chariganga (5.51), Char Chakundi-I (4.81) have granted higher avifaunal habitability while wetlands like Sudhakarpur (-4.23), Akandanga (-3.5), and Raibali (-3.29) have revealed perceptible degenerated situation. Spatial variation of the habitability status is examined by Wetland Threat Index (WTI) and size of the wetlands. One way ANOVA-Tukey's post hoc test exhibits that wetlands with less threat (WTI > 0.08) extends healthier habitats (p < 0.001; F = 5.79) and vice-versa. Subsequently, the study also reveals that larger wetlands (> 101 ha) have recorded greater AHI score than the small wetlands ((< 40 ha) at < 0.001 significance level (F = 13.40)). Therefore, this paper not only categorizes some floodplain wetlands based on AHI but also addresses spatial pattern and determinants of such habitability status over the Ganges delta. This study may attract the researchers and policy makers to assess the health of wetlands by using simple composite index in local to global level.

The current study is an attempt to investigate the development and diversity of livelihood in the region by considering six relevant criteria for each of the five livelihood-generating resources. The data retrieved via structured questionnaires and interviews were analyzed by employing the widely used Livelihood Development Index and sophisticated Simpson's Livelihood diversity index across constituent spatial units or blocks. The Principal Component Analysis reported tourism as the most significant potential predictor influencing the growth of livelihood across the region. This was subsequently followed by contributions from services, livestock, agriculture and horticulture. Of the selected criteria, income from tourism per month, income from transportation of tourists, income from commercial shops per month, income from services per month, income from milk and milk products per month, income from the sale of sheep and goats per year, income by selling of apricot and vegetables (only sale) per month were reported as the most significant criteria determi livelihood development in the region. Moreover, 18 criteria out of 30 showed significant values for Simpson's livelihood diversity index reflecting the impact of these criteria on livelihood development across the study area. The aggregate value of the index was highest for livestock (S.D.I = 0.894) that was followed by agriculture (S.D.I = 0.881), services (S.D.I = 0.876), horticulture (S.D.I = 0.871) and tourism (S.D.I = 0.851). Based on the results, the study would like to insist on more diversified opportunities and reduced vulnerability of livelihood to the people especially residing in the southern blocks of the study area.

Solms]	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE												Rapid global environmental changes could exacerbate the impacts of invasive plants on indigenous plant diversity, especially for freshwater ecosystems characterized by relatively simple plant community structures with low bioresistance. However, the abiotic and biotic determinants of plant diversity in aquatic invaded habitats remain unclear. In this study, we measured four alpha-species diversity indices (the Patrick richness index, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson diversity index, and Pielou evenness index) in aquatic plant communities invaded byEichhornia crassipesin southern China. We also recorded eight environmental parameters of these communities (longitude, latitude, elevation, dissolved oxygen, water conductivity, nitrate nitrogen, temperature, and precipitation), together with nine biotic traits ofE. crassipes[abundance, invasion cover, height, total carbon (C) content of the leaves and stems, total nitrogen (N) content of the leaves and stems, and the C:N ratio of leaves and stems]. We then used regression analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) to determine the dominant factors related to plant diversity. We found that the environment significantly affectedE. crassipesabundance, height, coverage, stem carbon, and tissue nitrogen, while the leaf C:N stoichiometric ratio was relatively stable. Increasing longitude significantly increased plant diversity, while elevated dissolved oxygen and precipitation slightly improved plant diversity, but increased elevation caused negative effects.E. crassipesinvasion significantly decreased all four diversity indices. Increases inE. crassipescoverage and leaf C:N strongly decreased plant diversity, and increased abundance slightly decreased diversity. Our study indicates that both the changing water environment and the properties of the aquatic invasive plants could have significant impacts on plant diversity. Thus, more attention should be paid to aquatic invasion assessment in lower longitudinal regions with lower native hydrophyte diversity.																			1664-462X					AUG 25	2020	11								1306	10.3389/fpls.2020.01306	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.01306								32983196					WOS:000570525800001

In this study, taking the desert plant community in the Ebinur Lake Basin in Xinjiang, China as the research object, the impacts of plant diversity on primary productivity and community stability along soil water and salinity gradients were investigated by calculating the species diversity, functional diversity, primary productivity, and community stability. The results showed that (1) the evenness index increased with decreasing soil water and salinity, while the Rao index and species diversity indices (ShannonWiener index, Simpson diversity index, and Patrick richness index) increased with increasing soil water and salinity. (2) The above-ground and below-ground biomass increased with increasing soil water and salinity, and the community stability in the low-water and low-salinity soil was the highest (0.272), followed by that in the medium-water and moderate-salinity soil (0.285) and the high-water and low-salinity soil (0.348). (3) In the high-water and high-salinity soil, functional diversity, above-ground biomass, and community stability were positively correlated with species diversity (R2 = 0.83, P < 0.05). In the medium-water and moderate-salinity soil, Patrick richness index and functional diversity were positively correlated with community stability (R2 = 0.74, P < 0.05), and soil pH and P concentration indirectly affected community stability by affecting functional diversity. In the low-water and low-salinity soil, Patrick richness index and belowground biomass were positively correlated with community stability (R2 = 0.14), with effect coefficients of 0.287 and 0.160, respectively (P > 0.05). This study is of great significance to make clear the responses of primary productivity and community stability to the changes in plant diversity under global warming.																				2351-9894				2022 AUG	2022	36								e02095	10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02095	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gecco.2022.e02095		APR 2022											WOS:000799020500006

Fish sampling was carried out from ten sites. The fishes were identified following standard taxonomic keys. Relative abundance (%) and diversity indices were calculated. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the fish abundance and diversity at different sites. Twenty fish species belonging to five families were recorded. Cyprinidae was the richest family represented by sixteen fish species, demonstrating a significant dominance (P<0.05) in number of species over other families. Tor macrolepis was the most abundant species (20.87%). A significant difference (P<0.001) was observed for species abundance at various sites, with maximum abundance (21.11%) found at Hingloon. Similarly, a significant difference (P<0.001) was demonstrated for species richness between different sites, with maximum taxa number found at Barthi. The fish fauna was indigenous with three endemic species i.e. Barilius pakistanicus, Labeo dyocheilus pakistanicus and Salmophasia punjabensis. Diversity indices values did not indicate conclusive status about fish diversity of the region. Simpson diversity index indicate greater diversity, Shannon Weiner indicate moderate diversity and Margalef index indicate poor fish diversity of the region. The occurrence in wild of some high value commercial fishes indicates towards commercial fisheries potential of the area.

The AGB prediction model, including only stand attributes, accounted for 85 % of the total variance inAGB (R-2) with anAkaike's information criterion (AIC) of 807.2407, Bayesian information criterion (BIC) of 809.5397, Schwarz Bayesian criterion (SBC) of 818.0426, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 38.529 Mg. After inclusion of the stand structural diversity into the model structure, considerable improvement was observed in statistical accuracy, including 97.5 % of the total variance in AGB, with an AIC of 614.1819, BIC of 617.1242, SBC of 633.0853, and RMSE of 15.8153 Mg. The predictive fitting results indicate that some indices describing the stand structural diversity can be employed as significant independent variables to predict the AGB production of the Scotch pine stand. Further, including the stand diversity indices in the AGB prediction model with the stand attributes provided important predictive contributions in estimating the total variance in AGB.

After microscopic identification and counting of 6 water samples(two of them is control plot), the water environment were evaluated by the phytoplankton species and quantity which were assessed by the biological diversity index, including Maglarf, Shanon-Wiener, Simpson diversity index, Pielou index and Berger-Parker dominance index. It's found that there are mainly 5 species of algae, and among them, Microcystis spp. et al., are the dominant species. So the water is assessed as eutrophication, Heavy sewage. Based on the diversity index analysis, the dredged area sampling sites were relatively higher than the non-dredged areas in biodiversity of phytoplankton. Summarily, the water quality after dredging has been improved to some extent. Phytoplankton biodiversity indicators should be the important water environmental assessment method.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of 3 commonly used pediatric antibiotics on the intestinal microbiome in healthy preschool children. Methods. Children aged 6-59 months were randomized (1:1:1:1) to a 5-day course of 1 of 3 antibiotics, including amoxicillin (25 mg/kg/d twice-daily doses), azithromycin (10 mg/kg dose on day 1 and then 5 mg/kg once daily for 4 days), cotrimoxazole (240 mg once daily), or placebo. Rectal swabs were obtained at baseline and 5 days after the last dose and were processed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The prespecified primary outcome was inverse Simpson's alpha-diversity index. Results. Post-treatment Simpson's diversity was significantly different across the 4 arms (P = .003). The mean Simpson's alpha-diversity among azithromycin-treated children was significantly lower than in placebo-treated children (6.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5-7.8; vs 9.8; 95% CI, 8.7-10.9; P = .0001). Diversity in children treated with amoxicillin (8.3; 95% CI, 7.0-9.6; P = .09) or cotrimoxazole (8.3; 95% CI, 8.2-9.7; P = .08) was not significantly different than placebo. Conclusions. Azithromycin affects the composition of the pediatric intestinal microbiome. The effect of amoxicillin and cotrimoxazole on microbiome composition was less clear.

Methods: Mosquito larvae, pupae and adults (male and female) were collected by using dippers and aspirators from September 2014 to August 2015 in different sites of Lahore comprising of ten towns i.e. Iqbal, Aziz Bhatti, Data Ganj Baksh, Gulberg, Nishtar, Ravi, Samanabad, Shalimar, Wagah, and Lahore Cantonment. Mosquito larvae and adults were identified by standard entomological keys. Diversity, richness and rarity of mosquito fauna were analyzed by the Shannon, Simpson and Margalef indices respectively. Results: In this study, a total of 8656 mosquitoes belonging to four genera namely Anopheles, Culex, Aedes and Mansonia were identified. Among fifteen species collected, Cx. quinquefasciatus was the most abundant species in the city having 25.8% relative abundance. However An. culicifacies s.l. (sensu lato) was reported as the least abundant species with 0.22% relative abundance. The highest diversity of mosquitoes was shown in the month of August (H = 2.25) while the lowest diversity was recorded June (H = 1.43). Extensive sewage water supported the maximum abundance of Cx. quinquifasciatus in urban areas of this city. Conclusions: This study has significantly elaborated the monthly varying species composition of mosquito fauna of this city. Hence this research will help us to find out the control strategies of mosquito borne diseases in this region.

Taheri			A New Coverage Range Index for Assessing Impact of Substrate Composition on Distribution of Hard Bottom Macrobenthos	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												This study evaluated the impact of substrate composition on macrobenthos distribution using a new Coverage Range Index (CRI), and diversity index variables and macrobenthos data sets obtained over a period of 12 months, between June 2015 and June 2016, along 6 sampling transects at 2 sites. The selected transects were all situated in littoral zone of Hormuz Island in the Persian Gulf and had hard bottom type with different substrate compositions. Accordingly, macrobenthos samples at each site were taken from 3 hard bottom types: boulder, cobble, and pebble. CRI and diversity indices (Simpson, Shannon-Wiener, Pielou, Brillouin, Menhinick, Margalef and Berger-Parker) were employed to evaluate the abundance of macrobenthos. CRI was also selected to tentatively assign the investigated abundance range of macrobenthos into 3 coverage range categories: wide, middle, narrow. CRI boundary of the categories was estimated. The analyses of CRI and diversity indices revealed a similar clustering between the sampling transects. These findings indicate that CRI is a simpler indicator in assessing abundance of macrobenthos than diversity indices, because CRI is only based on species abundance, but diversity indices are based on both species number and abundance. Hence, CRI proved to be a universal ecological index due to its different ranges of small to large samples, rare species to dominant ones, and individual specimens to polyps of animal colonies. Future study should focus on extending the database to test CRI in other bottom types. Finally, the results from this study may be useful not only for developing countries but also for any organization struggling to use macrobenthos based indices with restricted financial resources and knowledge.

Mapping tree diversity in the tropical forest region of Choco-Colombia	ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS												Understanding spatial patterns of diversity in tropical forests is indispensable for their sustainable use and conservation. Recent studies have reported relationships between forest structure and alpha-diversity. While tree alpha-diversity is difficult to map via remote sensing, large-scale forest structure models are becoming more common, which would facilitate mapping the relationship between tree alpha-diversity and forest structure, contributing to our understanding of biogeographic patterns in the tropics. We developed a methodology to map tree alpha-diversity in tropical forest regions at 50 m spatial resolution using alpha-diversity estimates from forest inventories as response variables and forest structural metrics and environmental variables as predictors. To include forest structural metrics in our modelling, we first developed a method to map seven of these metrics integrating discrete light detection and ranging (LiDAR), multispectral, and synthetic aperture radar imagery (SAR). We evaluated this methodology in the Choco region of Colombia, a tropical forest with high tree diversity and complex forest structure. The relative errors (REs) of the random forest models used to map the seven forest structural variables ranged from low (6%) to moderate (35%). The alpha-diversity maps had moderate RE; the maps of Simpson and Shannon diversity indices had the lowest RE (9% and 13%), followed by richness (17%), while Shannon and Simpson effective number of species indices had the highest RE, 27% and 47%, respectively. The highest concentrations of tree alpha-diversity are located along the Pacific Coast from the centre to the northwest of the Choco Region and in non-flooded forest along the boundary between the Choco region and the Andes. Our results reveal strong relationships between canopy structure and tree alpha-diversity, providing support for ecological theories that link structure to diversity via niche partitioning and environmental conditions. With modification, our methods could be applied to assess tree alpha-diversity of any tropical forest where tree alpha-diversity field observations coincident with LiDAR data.

To restore the degraded desert ecosystems, grazing exclusion (GE) was extensively implemented in recent decades. However, changes in the vegetation characteristics and plant biodiversity in different years of GE have not been thoroughly elucidated. This study paper examines the changes in desert community characteristics (i.e., biomass, coverage, density) and plant biodiversity (i.e. Margelef richness index, Simpson dominance index and Pielou evenness index) under lightly degraded desert (LD) in Urumqi with freely grazing (FG), 1 a, 6 a,9 a and moderately degraded desert (MD) in Shawan with FG, 1 a, 4 a, 11 a. The results indicated that the vegetation density and biomass in LD had no statistical difference response to GE, while compared with FG, the coverage and biomass of GE sites in MD sigiiificantly increased by 36.9%-115.7% and 62.9%-217.5%, respectively. Relative short-term GE could increase Simpson dominance index and Margelef richness index in LD, but the Simpson dominance index and Pielou evenness index reduced in relative long-term GE condition. In addition, we suggests that the optimal vegetation biomass and plants growth condition of LD and MD were calculated and observed at the 4-5 a and 7-11 a in our study areas, respectively. Hence, we proposed that degraded deserts should adopt the grazing management when it recovered to a certain extent.					sun, zongjiu/GQQ-4379-2022														1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	6					3845	3855																WOS:000405360700017

A total of 191 214 invertebrate specimens and 2221 species of plants and animals were analysed. Considering the value of the correlation coefficient R-2 as well as the effort for sorting and identification, a `top twenty' list of indicator groups favours Heteroptera, flowering plants, Symphyta and aculeate Hymenoptera as the best choice for biodiversity evaluation. In general, flight traps rated better than pitfall traps. In most taxonomic groups, diversity indices such as the Shannon and the Simpson index were only weakly correlated with local species diversity.

J	Shiferaw, A; Yazezew, D				Shiferaw, Alemayehu; Yazezew, Dereje			Diversity, distribution and relative abundance of avifauna at Ansas Dam and surrounding farmland site Debre Berhan Town, Ethiopia	AVIAN BIOLOGY RESEARCH												The diversity, distribution, and relative abundance of avifauna were studied at and Around Ansas Dam, Debre Berhan Town, Ethiopia, from early September 2018 to early February 2019, covering both wet and dry seasons. Line transect technique was employed to study the diversity, abundance and distribution of birds species in the farmland site while total count employed on the dam. Data were collected in both wet and dry seasons from 6:30 to 10:00 early morning and 15:30 to 18.00 late afternoon, when birds are more active. The data were analyzed with Shannon-Weiner Index, Simpson Index, Evenness Index, and relative abundance. A total of 45 bird species (35 in the dam and 22 in the farmland) belonging to nine orders and 21 families were recorded during the study period. Order Passeriformes (37.8%) followed by order Charadriformes (24.4%) were represented highest number. From all identified species at Ansas Dam and surrounding farmland, Abyssinian longclaw, Black-headed siskins, White-tailed swallow, Blue-winged goose, and Spotbreasted lapwing were endemic birds to Ethiopia. The highest Shannon diversity (H'= 2.1) was recorded in dam during the dry season while the lowest (H' =1.78) was recorded during wet season in farmland. However, the Simpson diversity Index of avian species indicated relatively higher avian species diversity during the dry season in darn (D =0.80) than farmland (D=0.71) habitat. Evenness was highest in the dam (E =0.65) and lowest in the farmland (E =0.58) habitat. More avian species similarity (S1= 0.42) at farmland and darn habitat during the wet season but least similarity (S1=0.2) was observed during the dry season. Most birds had scored rare in the ordinal scale while few species with abundant and uncommon ranks in both habitats and seasons. Conservation of the different charismatic bird species should be taken as an important component of wildlife management plan in the area.

Here, No, a diversity index based on the species' contribution to the similarity between samples in a group, is presented. N-90 uses the results of the classic Similarity Percentage analysis and a jack-knife routine to calculate the average and a dispersion value of the number of species contributing up to the ninety percent of the similarity in a group of samples. N-90 is applied to two groups of samples subjected to contrasting levels of bottom trawl fishing pressure using time series of experimental bottom trawl surveys of the Balearic Islands. The results are compared to those obtained using more 'traditional' diversity indices such as species richness, Shannon-Wienner, Simpson, Pielou, and Margalef diversity indices. The N-90 diversity index displayed a clear response to fishing pressure with significantly lower values in impacted communities, while the 'traditional' diversity indices showed almost null sensitivity to fishing pressure. In addition, No also detects indirect fishing impacts by fluctuating in response to environmental variation in impacted areas, making this index sensitive to the synergies between climate and fishing impact at community level. The application of the N-90 diversity index to the case study shows that it may be an alternative to 'traditional' diversity indices when trying to monitor fishing impacts and the effects of environmental changes. Its units, number of species, and the corresponding summary list of species facilitate the interpretability of the results, improving the communication to managers and stakeholders.

Focal species diversity patterns can provide diagnostic information on plant invasions	JOURNAL FOR NATURE CONSERVATION												In Europe, coastal sandy habitats are considered highly endangered among those included in the EC Directive 92/43/EEC (Habitats Directive). Among the different threats which affect coastal communities, the spread of alien plants has been claimed to induce changes in community diversity and structure. We therefore set out to analyse diversity patterns of native and focal species (diagnostic and characteristic of coastal dune habitats of European conservation interest) in sandy coastal habitats invaded by Carpobrotus aff. acinaciformis, a widespread alien plant. Focal species are a major conservation target for the Habitats Directive and their decline should be considered a serious threat for the whole habitat. The study was performed in the Central Western coast of Italy. We randomly sampled the vegetation of the holocenic dune by 2 m x 2 m plots. First we split the collected data in two sets: invaded and non-invaded. We compared overall native and focal species richness patterns of the two sets by rarefaction curves. Then, in order to describe the singular aspects of species diversity (e.g. richness, Shannon index, Simpson index, Berger-Parker index), we also compared Renyi's diversity profiles and we tested the significance of the differences between invaded and non invaded sets using a bootstrap procedure. Rarefaction curves of the non-invaded set rise quickly and reach higher accumulation values than the invaded set, but differences between the two curves were not significant. With respect to Renyi's profiles, the profile for the invaded dataset was always below the non-invaded one, but differences in diversity were significant only when specifically considering the focal species (Shannon, Simpson and Berger-Parker indices). In the analysed case, the invasion is significantly associated with changes in focal species diversity, instead those differences are not evident on the all native species pool. In the case of recent invasions, a consistent decline on focal species diversity may represent an early alarm sign of diversity loss and may help define specific conservation actions to prevent the decrease of overall diversity.

Using unmanned aerial vehicle multispectral data for monitoring the outcomes of ecological restoration in mining areas	LAND DEGRADATION & DEVELOPMENT												The effective and efficient monitoring of revegetation outcomes is a key component of ecosystem restoration. Monitoring often involves labor-intensive manual methods, which are difficult to deploy when sites are inaccessible or involve large areas of revegetation. This study aimed to identify plant species and quantify alpha-diversity index on a sub-meter scale at Manlailiang Mine Site in Northwestern China using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as a means to semiautomate large-scale vegetation monitoring. UAVs equipped with multispectral sensors were combined with three industry-standard supervised classification algorithms (support vector machine [SVM], maximum likelihood, and artificial neural network) to classify plant species. Spectral vegetation indices (normalized difference vegetation index [NDVI], difference vegetation index [DVI], visible-band difference vegetation index, soil-adjusted vegetation index, modified soil-adjusted vegetation index, and excess green-excess red) were used to assess vegetation diversity obtained from on-ground survey plot data (the Margalef, Pielou, Simpson, and Shannon-Wiener indices). Our results showed that SVM outperformed other algorithms in species identification accuracy (overall accuracy of 84%). Significant relationships were observed between vegetation indices and diversity indices, with the DVI performing significantly better than many more commonly used indices such as the NDVI. The findings highlight the potential of combining UAV multispectral data, spectral vegetation indices and ground surveys for effective and efficient fine-scale monitoring of vegetation diversity in the ecological restoration of mining areas. This has significant practical benefits for improving adaptive management of restoration through improved monitoring tools.

Organic and mineral soil samples were collected on two dales from Pinus banksiana plots that had been clear-cut, clear-cut followed by prescribed burning, clear-cut followed by scarification, or had not been harvested. Microorganisms were extracted from the soil samples and used to inoculate Gram-negative Biolog(R) plates. Patterns of substrate metabolism were used to calculate Shannon, Simpson, McIntosh, and related evenness indices. Principal component analysis (PCA) resolved organic and mineral soils. Organic soil exhibited higher metabolic diversity than mineral soil. Scarified plots showed lower diversity on one date, when diversity indices were calculated using all carbon sources, and on both dates when calculated using carboxylic acids, only. The results suggest that SCSU may be used to assess the impact of forestry practices on microbial diversity and community structure by using a subset of carbon substrates.																			0095-3628	1432-184X				SEP-OCT	1997	34	2					125	130											9230100					WOS:A1997XM77200006

The impacts of 2 dams in the Ruzizi River on macroinvertebrate community composition and diversity were surveyed every 3 months from December 2015 to October 2017. Macroinvertebrate samples were collected at sites upstream and downstream and additionally at two sites further downstream of the dams, in both comparatively pristine and highly disturbed areas. Several indices (Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson index, Pielou's evenness, Rare Family Prevalence, and Average Score Per Taxa) were used to determine the alpha diversity and evenness of macroinvertebrates at the family level. Our results showed little to no immediate effect of the dams on macroinvertebrate diversity. Macroinvertebrate composition differed slightly below the dams compared to upstream. Communities near Dam II had slightly higher diversity compared to Dam I, probably because the vicinity to Lake Kivu has an immediate effect on diversity upstream of the first dam and likely because Dam II is 30 years younger than Dam I. This study suggests the importance of using species-level indices to better understand the ecological impacts of dams on macroinvertebrate diversity of tropical rivers with low species diversity.

Spatial distribution of butterflies in different macrohabitat in a university campus in Southern-Nigeria	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TROPICAL INSECT SCIENCE												Butterfly fauna remains an important bio-indicator species in maintaining a healthy habitat, agents for plant richness, amongst others. Spatial distribution of butterflies in four habitat types including shrub, forested areas, agricultural farmland and riverside using baited traps and pollard walk methods was conducted from April to August, 2019 to ascertain the records of butterfly checklist in Delta State University, Abraka, Nigeria. Findings of the study revealed a total of 430 individuals and 44 species of butterflies belonging to four families such as Nymphalidae Papilionidae, Pieridae, and Lycaenidae. Nymphalidae had the highest species and individuals (72.7% and 74.9%) and lowest in Lycaenidae. Of all the species collected, Acraea serena was the most abundant recording highest Shannon diversity index (H = 2.477), Simpson Dominance (1-D = 0.874), and Margalef (5.368). Alpha diversity in various habitat revealed highest Simpson Dominance (1-D = 0.893), Shannon index (H = 2.627), and Margalef index (4.932) in forest area. However, species were evenly distributed (0.682) and equitable (J = 0.834) in the riverside habitat. Abundance-Distribution Model shows high significance variation in species obtained from the shrub, agricultural farm and forested areas with an exception to the riverside habitat (chi(2) = 0.57, p = 0.99). The present study is not conclusive as future studies are required to update butterfly checklist. More so, habitat destruction or disruption, a major threat to butterfly conservation, should be placed on check.

J	Kent, R; Carmel, Y				Kent, Rafi; Carmel, Yohay			Evaluation of five clustering algorithms for biodiversity surrogates	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												Conservation planning requires knowledge of the distribution of all species in the area of interest. Surrogates for biodiversity are considered as a possible solution. The two major types are biological and environmental surrogates. Here, we evaluate four different methods of hierarchical clustering, as well as one non-hierarchical method, in the context of producing surrogates for biodiversity. Each clustering method was used to produce maps of both surrogate types. We evaluated the representativeness of each clustering method by finding the average number of species represented in a set of sites, one site of each domain, which was carried out with Monte-Carlo permutations procedure. We propose an additional measure of surrogate performance, which is the degree of evenness of the different domains, e.g., by calculating Simpson's diversity index. Surrogates with low evenness leave little flexibility in site selection since often some of the domains may be represented by a single or very few sites, and thus surrogate maps with a high Simpson's index value may be more relevant for actual decision making. We found that there is a trade-off between species representativeness and evenness. Centroid clustering represented the most species, but had very low values of evenness. Ward's method of minimum variance represented more species than a random choice, and had high evenness values. Using the typical evaluation measures, the Centroid clustering method was most efficient for surrogate production. However, when Simpson's index is also considered, Ward's method of minimum variance is more appropriate for managers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tree individual numbers were collected in permanent sample plots which were placed in the intact zone (INT), transitional zones (TRA) and devastated zones (DEV), designed in 2007 to monitor the mangrove succession. Diversity was examined via diversity indices including tree density (D), Shannon -Wiener (H'), Evenness (E) and Simpson's Dominance index (Cd). The species numbers in the INT, TRA and DEV sections were 3, 5 and 10 respectively. The highest tree density of Rhizophora apiculata Blume was acquired in the INT and TRA zone while Avicennia spp. was the dominant species in the DEV zones. The H' and Cd indices revealed a significant difference between the DEV zone and the others in terms of species diversity. Avicennia spp. was widely distributed in the devastated zone. On the other hand, their appearance frequency in the TRA zone was low, but these species were dominant in the DEV zone. After 13 years of self-recovery, the devastated mangrove was turning into a multi-species community while the transitional zone tended to sustain the monoculture structure.																			2278-4535					AUG	2023	18	8								10.25303/1808rjbt032038	http://dx.doi.org/10.25303/1808rjbt032038													WOS:001037591300005
J	Wu, H; Carrillo, J; Ding, JQ				Wu, Hao; Carrillo, Juli; Ding, Jianqing			Species diversity and environmental determinants of aquatic and terrestrial communities invaded by <i>Alternanthera</i> <i>philoxeroides</i>	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The impact of invasive species on native biodiversity varies across environments, with invasion effects of amphibious plant species across terrestrial and aquatic systems especially poorly understood. In this study, we established 29 terrestrial plots and 23 aquatic plots which were invaded by the alien plant alligator weed, Alternanthera philoxeroides in Southern China. We measured alpha-species diversity (Shannon-Wiener and Simpson index), species richness and evenness, species cover and the importance value (a comprehensive index of cover, height and abundance) of A. philoxeroides in invaded communities in both aquatic and terrestrial habitats. We recorded seven environmental factors (longitude, latitude, elevation above sea level, temperature, precipitation, ammonia and nitrate) across habitats. We then used Redundancy Analysis (RDA) to determine which factors best explain A. philoxeroides invasion in either environment type. We found that terrestrial habitats had greater species diversity (Shannon index) than aquatic habitats, and the biotic resistance of aquatic plant communities to the A. philoxeroides invasion was weaker than terrestrial plant communities. Accumulated ammonia improved some indices of species diversity (Shannon-Weiner, Simpson) and evenness, but decreased species cover of A. philoxeroides in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Precipitation increased species richness in terrestrial habitats but decreased richness in aquatic habitats. Precipitation increased A. philoxeroides cover in both environment types, while elevated nitrate increased A. philoxeroides cover in terrestrial habitats only. In aquatic habitats, species richness increased but A. philoxeroides cover decreased with increasing longitude. Our study indicates that increased precipitation may accelerate A. philoxeroides spread across aquatic and terrestrial habitats, while reducing nitrate inputs could inhibit terrestrial A. philoxeroides invasion. Aquatic communities appear to be more vulnerable to invasion by A. philoxeroides than terrestrial communities, likely due to low native species diversity. We need to intensify invasion assessment of water ecosystems in lower longitudinal regions of China and elsewhere where diversity is low. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Two hundred fifty-nine plant species were recorded in the 94 sample plots investigated, up to 235 species all appeared in the herb layer, and the species of woody plants were very limited. The communities with a complicated vertical structure presented higher values of indices. The distribution pattern of plant species diversity on the northern slope was affected by such factors as elevation, slope aspect, slope gradient, total nitrogen, total potassium, soil water content, organic matter, and that on the southern slope was mainly affected by such factors as slope gradient, elevation, available phosphorus, and soil water content. On the northern slope, Patrick index and Shannon-Wiener index of the plant communities presented a bimodality pattern along altitude; Simpson index and Pielou index showed a partially unimodal pattern. On the southern slope all the distribution pattern of species diversity indices showed two peaks, though Patrick index's bimodality pattern was not an obvious one. These altitudinal patterns were formed by the synthetic action of a variety of environmental factors with elevation playing an important role.

The correlations between the bacterial community and soil environmental factors were also examined. The results showed that the broadleaf forests (JM, QM, MB) had higher levels of total C (TC), total N (TN), available N (AN), and available K (AK) compared to the coniferous forests (PT, LG, PK) and conifer-broadleaf forest (CB). Different revegetation pathways had different effects on the soil bacterial community diversity and structure. For the alpha-diversity, the highest Shannon index and Simpson index were found in JM. The Simpson index was significantly positively correlated with the available P (AP) (P < 0.05), and the Shannon index was significantly positively correlated with AK (P < 0.05). Compared with others, the increased ACE index and Chao1 index were observed in the CB and MB, and both of these alpha-diversity were significantly negative with AK (P < 0.05). The relative abundances of bacterial phyla and genera differed among different revegetation types. At the phylum level, the dominant phylum groups in all soils were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Gemmatimonadetes, and Planctomycetes. Significant differences in relative abundance of bacteria phyla were found for Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Gemmatimonadetes, and Proteobacteria. Correlation analysis showed that Soil pH, TC, TN, AP, and AK were the main abiotic factors structuring the bacterial communities. As revealed by the clear differentiation of bacterial communities and the clustering in the heatmap and in the PCA plots, broadleaf forests and coniferous forests harbored distinct bacterial communities, indicating a significant impact of the respective reforestation pathway on soil bacterial communities in the Baishilazi Nature Reserve.

Four experimental treatments were used: CK, organic manure, mineral NPK fertilizer, and organic manure plus mineral fertilizer. The diversity of the nirS gene was analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The Shannon diversity index and Evenness factor, Simpson's diversity and Shannon-Weiner indices, principal component analysis and a one-way analysis of similarities test showed that organic manure made the opposite contribution to soil diversity of nirS genes compared to mineral fertilizer treatment, which resulted in increased diversity of the nirS gene. Comparison of the phylogenetic analysis of nirS genes in the mineral fertilizer and organic manure clone libraries showed that induction by mineral fertilizer was stronger than that by organic manure, based on the types of unique nirS genotypes found in the two libraries and the evolutionary distances between them.

J	Barnes, RSK				Barnes, R. S. K.			What does measuring species diversity in estuarine seagrass systems actually assess?	MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Relationships between species diversity and other species-density and species-richness metrics were investigated in the seagrass macrobenthos of Knysna estuarine bay, South Africa. Although a wide range of species density occurred across sites, neither Hill-Shannon nor Hill-Simpson diversity showed any significant relationship with it, although they did with species richness. Instead species diversity was very closely related to relative evenness, and (negatively) to overall assemblage abundance. No significant relationship was found between species density and evenness. Whilst there was a clear and marked decrease in species density upstream along the main estuarine channel, only one of the species-diversity indices (the Hill-Shannon) showed a significant equivalent decrease. Relationships depended on how 'species richness' was assessed, and were very strongly influenced by the superabundant local occurrence of a few individual faunal components (three gastropod and one tanaid species). Species-diversity analysis contributes nothing new in such estuarine seagrass meadows and seems best avoided.

The intestinal microbiome is associated with metabolic syndrome and obesity in the general population, and is perturbed during cancer therapy. We aimed to determine if long-term survivors of pediatric cancer would have reduced bacterial microbiome diversity, and if these findings would be associated with components of the metabolic syndrome, obesity, and chronic inflammation. We performed a cross-sectional exploratory study examining the intestinal microbiome via 16S amplicon sequencing, treatment history, clinical measurements (blood pressure, body mass index) and biomarkers (hemoglobin A1c, lipoproteins, adiponectin: leptin ratio, C-reactive protein, TNF alpha, Interleukin-6, and Interleukin-10) between 35 long-term survivors and 32 age, sex, and race matched controls. All subjects were aged 10-40 years, and survivors were at least five years from therapy completion. Survivors had lower alpha diversity compared to controls (Shannon index p = .001, Simpson index p = .032) and differently abundant bacterial taxa. Further, among survivors, those who received radiation (18/35) to the central nervous system or abdomen/pelvis had decreased alpha diversity compared to those who did not receive radiation (Shannon and Simpson p < .05 for both). Although, no specific component of metabolic syndrome or cytokine was associated with measures of alpha diversity, survivors with low adiponectin-lectin ratio, elevated body mass index, and elevated C-reactive protein had differently abundant taxa compared to those with normal measures. The microbiome of cancer survivors remains less diverse than controls even many years after diagnosis, and exposure to radiation may lead to further loss of diversity in survivors.

Despite the importance that this relict represents for a city lacking in wooded areas, there is no information on its richness, diversity, and geographical affinity. Hence the objective of this work, to carry out an inventory of the vascular flora components, determining the current geographic distribution patterns of the families, genera, and species, and specify the richness, diversity, and floristic similarity of El Conde and Malinalli ravines. This was done through field trips and botanical specimen collection, using the Margalef, Pielou and Simpson indices to estimate alpha diversity patterns and the Sorensen Similarity Index to determine beta diversity. A list of 105 species was obtained, grouped into 81 genera and 40 families, and both ravines have a medium to high alpha and beta diversity. Because to the ecosystem services that wooded areas provide to urban areas, knowledge of the forest should be deepened, and the study extended to other ravines as a step towards recovery, remediation, management, and conservation.																			2448-7597					SPR	2021	27	1							e2712113	10.21829/myb.2021.2712113	http://dx.doi.org/10.21829/myb.2021.2712113													WOS:000731074300010

The macroinvertebrates lived in upstream and downstream zones as well as in the river free of any anthropogenic impact. We sampled 14 543 macroinvertebrate individuals in order to show how they respond to an impounding reservoir. We employed biotic indices (BMWP-PL, ASPT) to prove their usefulness as the indicators of anthropogenic perturbation. The diversity of macroinvertebrate species above dams and in the "natural" river was significantly higher than below dams. The chironomids and dipterans dominated downstream. However, the density of Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Crustacea was significantly reduced downstream. The analysis of Simpson's diversity index also proved the above results.

Diversity and Habitat Distributions of Ground-surface Spiders (Araneae) in Kings Mountain National Military Park, South Carolina	SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST												We surveyed ground-surface spider populations in Kings Mountain National Military Park, Blacksburg, SC, monthly from August 2009 through July 2010 using pitfall traps to collect spiders at 2 sites in each of 3 forest habitat types: riparian zones, dry forest areas, and ridgetop habitats. Of the 902 adult spiders collected, we identified 848 to species, representing 85 species in 22 families. Although each habitat type supported a unique set of species, each also shared species with the other habitat types. High Chao-Sorenson similarity values were seen in comparisons of both forest and ridgetop as well as forest and riparian habitats. We used the first 3 Hill numbers, species richness ( degrees D), Shannon exponential ( I D), and inverse Simpson ( 2 D) indices, to compare diversity among habitat types. Species richness was significantly higher in the riparian compared to the ridgetop habitat, while both the Shannon exponential and inverse Simpson indices were significantly higher in the riparian habitat than in either the forest or ridgetop habitats, which did not differ from each other. Diversity was not significantly different between any pairs of sites within habitats with the exception of coverage-based species richness in the dry forest habitat. Within a habitat type, the 2 forest sites had the highest Chao-Sorenson similarity value, followed by the 2 ridgetop sites, with the 2 riparian sites being the least similar to each other.																			1528-7092	1938-5412				MAR	2020	19	1					128	151		10.1656/058.019.0113	http://dx.doi.org/10.1656/058.019.0113													WOS:000521638500015

We described the biotic and abiotic factors of the three study sites and estimated the Shannon diversity index, the Pielou evenness, the Simpson dominance, and the Jaccard similarity indices based on the mycobiota. A total of 37 species were identified; these are the first records of fungi in the Sierra de Mazatan. Tulostoma, Geastrum, and Lycoperdon were the most represented genera with nine, seven, and six species, respectively. Fungal diversity was 2.9 in mesquite scrub, 2.4 in oak forest, and 0.9 in subtropical scrub.

J	Golder, D; Chattopadhyay, S				Golder, Debashree; Chattopadhyay, Sanjib			Interrelationship between physico-chemical characteristics of a tropical lake and their impact on biodiversity of planktons	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY												The physicochemical parameters including temperature, pH, dissolved O-2, free CO2, total alkalinity, permanent hardness, salinity, transparency, specific conductivity, BOD, COD, phosphate and nitrate were studied in a tropical lake, called Bonhooghly Lake (situated at Baranagar, Kolkata) around the year 2014 and the correlation between the said parameters, as well as their impact on Biodiversity indices were made. There is stable increase of CO2 content in water from August (27.24 mg l(-1)) and afterwards due to decaying of plant materials. Therefore there is a slight fall of pH (7.1). Significant negative correlation (p<0.01) between pH and CO2 content was also obtained. It also shows a significant negative correlation with O-2 content as well. During February and March transparency of water falls significantly with the increase of algal bloom. It significantly decreases dissolved O-2 content and pH but increases free dissolved CO2 (p<0.01). Phosphate has a definite correlation with nitrate content of the Lake, possibly because both are among the most essential nutrients of living system. Increase of one obviously indicates escalation of other. During the early months of the year phosphate and nitrate content of water increased steadily (up to 0.13 and 1.85 mg 11 respectively) and a very high number of Chlamydomonas(up to 15100 1(-1)) and Chlorella (up to 13140 l(-1))were observed. Species richness indices (Menhinick's index) of Phytoplanktons were observed maximum in the month of May, dominance (Simpson's index) in January and diversity (Shannon-Weaver index) in April. Zooplanktons also followed the same trend indicating close interdependence. It was significant that apart from other factors, temperature played a most pivotal role in bringing the diversity in the plankton community.																			0254-8704					NOV	2016	37	6					1281	1289											29257653					WOS:000389393000008

JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												Ecological diversity of Carabid beetles was conducted in plains of upper Sindh for the first-time during August 2018 to March 2019. The study was carried out at five sampling sites and adults were trapped with the help of light trap and pitfall trap. A total of 783 specimens belonging to six species was collected, among them 213 individuals and 6 species were captured at Khairpur, 159 individuals of 6 species were collected at Shikarpur, 146 individuals from 6 species were caught at Sukkur whereas 136 and 129 individuals of 6 species were trapped at Nausheroferoz and Moro respectively, most of species were found in muddy soils and agricultural fields in the months of July, August and September which coincided with humidity, temperature, vegetation, and greater number of crops in those months, the least abundant was found in barren and bushy fields in the months of December, January and February with low humidity, temperature and presence of flowering plants and larvae. Biodiversity was calculated using the Simpson Diversity Index and species evenness, the sites 1 and 5 had a large numerical value for homogeneity and i-e diversity (E, 0.91 and D, 5.5). The whole dominant structure of Carabid complex revealed two most dominant species Calosoma auropunctuam (Herbst 1874) and Nesambloyps oreobious (Broun 1893), and one least abundant species was Harpalus suensoni (Dejean 1829).																			1018-7081	2309-8694				DEC	2021	31	6					1645	1651		10.36899/JAPS.2021.6.0368	http://dx.doi.org/10.36899/JAPS.2021.6.0368													WOS:000724896500012
J	Sun, J; Wang, NA; Niu, ZM				Sun, Jie; Wang, Nai'ang; Niu, Zhenmin			Effect of Soil Environment on Species Diversity of Desert Plant Communities	PLANTS-BASEL												Desert ecosystems possess an astonishing biodiversity and are rich in endangered species. This study investigated characteristics of species diversity and soil environmental factors in three major deserts of China's Alxa Plateau. The Alxa Desert included 183 plant species belonging to 109 genera and 35 families. The highest numbers of plant species belonged to the Compositae, Gramineae, and Chenopodiaceae families. The research area belongs to the semi-shrub and small semi-shrub deserts in temperate deserts. Species diversity was low, with the Shannon-Wiener index (H ') of shrub-herb = shrub > herb > tree. The Pielou evenness index (E) of shrub herb vegetation was the lowest, indicating more enriched species and fewer sparse species in the community, and that these types of vegetation had the characteristics of rich and obviously dominant species. Redundancy analysis (RDA) and correlations between the comprehensive plant community biodiversity index and soil factors indicated that soil-available phosphorus (NP), organic matter (SOM), and electrical conductivity (EC) had significant impacts on community species diversity. The herbaceous shrub community exhibited the highest H ' , Simpson index (D), species richness index (S), soil moisture (SW), and soil nutrients. Planting Calligonum mongolicum, Ephedra membranacea, Artemisia annua, and Phragmites australis to form a typical desert shrub community for community diversity protection is recommended to effectively protect and restore desert ecosystems.																				2223-7747				OCT	2023	12	19							3465	10.3390/plants12193465	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants12193465								37836205					WOS:001084061900001

At 28 d of age four pigs were killed and were designated as the preweaning control (PW). Four pigs remained on the sow (Sow), four pigs were fed a corn-soy-lactose (CSL) diet, and the remaining four pigs were fed a corn-soy (CS) diet. Pigs from the latter three treatments were killed at 38 d of age. Tissue samples were taken from the pars esophagus, ileum, and cecum and the adherent lactobacilli were enumerated using Rogosa SL agar. Bacterial colonies were randomly selected from Rogosa SL agar plates and speciated using cell type, morphology, and substrate fermentation tests. The species data were used to calculate the Shannon, Simpson, and evenness diversity indices. Shannon and Simpson diversity index values when averaged across tissues were lower (P <.05) for PW than for postweaning treatments (Sow, CSL, and CS) and lower (P <.05) when pigs receiving sow's milk (PW and Sow) were compared with pigs receiving the dry diets (CSL and CS). The diversity of adherent Lactobacillus is altered by the form of the diet fed to weanling pigs, and statistical ecological methods provide a powerful way of analyzing the ecology of the gastrointestinal tract.																			0021-8812					AUG	1995	73	8					2347	2354											8567472					WOS:A1995RN30900024

J	Abu Seri, N; Abd Rahman, A				Abu Seri, Nurhafizul; Abd Rahman, Azimah			The Compilation Records of Fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) Diversity and Distribution and Display Trees Throughout Malaysia	PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												The populations of fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) are increasingly being threatened, and it is, thus, a significant problem in Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia. Fireflies and their habitat must immediately be protected before they go extinct. Simpson's Diversity Index used in this paper review to measure the diversity of firefly species across Malaysia. The Simpson's Diversity Index showed that the richness and evenness of firefly species in Malaysia is infinite diversity with D = 0.2255. The authors compiled and reviewed the studies on the firefly species to incorporate available information/data and emphasised their preferred habitat/display trees in response to the issue. Therefore, this paper was also able to track down records of fireflies' species' distribution through the previous studies in eight states in West Malaysia (Peninsula), namely Johor, Kelantan, Kuala Lumpur, Pahang, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, and Terengganu, as well as two states in East Malaysia (Borneo), namely Sabah and Sarawak. It indicates that firefly species, especially from the genera Pteroptyx (Pteroptyx tener species), are widely distributed in Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia. Based on the records from the study conducted by previous researchers, it was found that the population of fireflies is declining in some areas in Malaysia, and so are their habitats and host/display trees that have suffered the same decline. Perhaps, this paper will help broaden human beings' geographical understanding/knowledge and create awareness which eventually leads to conservation actions of firefly species and their host/display trees.

The current study assessed impact of Broussonetia papyrifera invasion on native vegetation in Pothwar region of Pakistan. The approach used for study was random samplings with two categorical factors; invaded and non-invaded (control) under same habitat conditions. Differences in number of species (S), abundance (N), species richness (R), evenness (J'), Shannon diversity index (H') and Simpson index of dominance (lambda) were compared between invaded and control plots by t-test series. Control plots harbored by average of 1.28 more species per 10 m(2). The control category was diverse (H' = 2.15) than invaded category (H' = 1.65). The higher value of species richness in control plots shows heterogeneous nature of communities and vice versa in invaded plots. The lower value of index of dominance in invaded plots shows less sample diversity than control ones. This decrease in number of species directly affects a-diversity in invaded plots. At multivariate scale, ordination (nMDS) and ANOSIM showed significant magnitude of differences between invaded and control plots in all sites. The decrease in diversity indices in invaded indicated that plant communities become less productive due to Paper mulberry invasion. This makes B. papyrifera candidate of consideration for appropriate control measures.

S. Enteritidis phage type 4 (PT4) especially presents a real challenge for the classical typing methods. We developed a simple multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) assay based oil three hypervariable variable-number tandem repeat (VNTR) loci for subtyping of Salmonella Enteritidis. Testing an arbitrary chosen strain collection of 110 S. Enteritidis isolates, comprising PTs 4, 8, and 21, the MLVA assay yielded a higher discriminatory power, corresponding to a Simpson's index of diversity (ID) of 0.91, when compared to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) which had a Simpson's ID of 0.41. To simplify interpretation of results, we developed a VNTR allele code based on the repeat unit number. This code can easily be exchanged. In conclusion, MLVA is a promising new tool to investigate outbreaks of S. Enteritidis and constitutes a useful addition to the current phage typing scheme. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

In this study, the key pathogenic fungi in adlay smut disease were first identified by internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) high-throughput sequencing and then used to elucidate the composition and diversity of the fungal community in adlay smut. Results indicate that an abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were detected in the infected involucres of flowering plants and the OTUs were classified to nine phyla, 20 classes, 45 orders, 90 families and 119 genera. A total of 4 986 OTUs clustered together, sharing six core OTUs in all samples, while 145 OTUs were shared among four geographical groups. The Shannon and Simpson indices ranged from 0.137-1.629 and 0.357-0.970, respectively. Community diversity ranked as Anshun (AS) Qinglong (QL)>Xingren (XR)>Xingyi (XY) among the four geographical groups by Shannon and Simpson indices, exhibiting complex community diversities among accessions and geographical groups. The richness and diversity data imply a weak relationship between the accession community richness and geographical origins of samples. Two closely related fungal genera, Sporisorium and Ustilago, were implicated as causes of smut disease. The genus Sporisorium appears to be more commonly found among accessions and thus is more likely to be the fungal pathogen causing smut in adlay. This work can facilitate strategies to control and prevent smut infection to improve adlay yield.

Genetic diversity and parentage analysis of aspen demes	NEW FORESTS												Genetic diversity and genealogical relationships among individuals of eight aspen demes in a common garden experiment were studied using microsatellite (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. Moderate to high levels of genetic diversity were observed within all demes for the SSR and AFLP markers. The Shannon index for the AFLP markers was positively and significantly correlated with the average observed heterozygosity for the SSR markers across the demes. Comparative analysis of the numbers of the full-sibling groups inferred by different algorithms suggested that the 2-allele algorithm was more accurate than the other methods used in the study. However, in general, significant correlations were found in the numbers of the full-sibling groups inferred by some other algorithms, such as a heuristic algorithm, the 2-allele algorithm, and the Simpson, modified Simpson and pairwise score algorithms. Among demes, the USA and Swiss demes had the highest and lowest numbers, respectively, of full-sibling groups. This combined approach for sibship reconstruction can also be applied to infer the number of paternal or maternal parents in forest tree plantations when no parental information is available; this approach can improve our understanding of family structure and the extent of genetic diversity within forest tree plantations when no diversity, origin, or parental genotypes information is available.

Tree species composition and diversity in natural temperate forests of the North-Western Himalayas	ACTA ECOLOGICA SINICA												The present study was undertaken in the natural temperate Himalayan forests of Himachal Pradesh, India, to assess the tree species composition and diversity. For this purpose, six major forest types (FT) viz., FT1- Upper Himalayan Pinus roxburghii forest, FT2- Quercus leucotrichophora forest, FT3- Low-level P. wallichiana forest, FT4-Moist C. deodara forest, FT5- Western Mixed Coniferous Forest, FT6- Pinus gerardiana forest were selected. Detailed sampling was carried out in these forest types, and the sample plots in each forest type were laid out using the stratified random approach. Tree stem density varied from 191.11 N ha(-1) (FT6) to 441.11 N ha(-1) (FT2), whereas the tree total basal cover varied from 20.01 m(2) ha(-1) (FT6) to 47.59 m(2) ha(-1) (FT5). The diversity indices reflected that a total of 21 tree species (16 genera, 11 families) were identified, with tree species richness ranging from 3 (FT6) to 9 (FT1 & FT5). The forest type FT5 recorded the maximum Shannon index of diversity (2.36), Simpson Index of diversity (0.75), Margalef's Index of richness (1.37), pielou equitability (0.74), menheink index of species richness (0.49), whereas the highest Shannon Index of diversity (0.73) and species heterogeneity (0.85) in FT6 forest type. Furthermore, dominance-diversity (d-d) curves drawn that all the six forest types showed geometric curves reveals that one or two tree species are dominant in a particular forest type. Simultaneously, the research area's species diversity, tree stem density, and tree total basal cover were equivalent to those seen in other sections of Western Himalayas.

EFFECT OF ANTHROPOGENIC LAND-USE ON ARTHROPODS DIVERSITY IN SUB-TROPICAL PUNJAB, PAKISTAN	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												Present study was conducted to assess the effect of different land-use types i.e., agriculture, planted forest, grassy plots and desert on the diversity of soil crawling arthropods at the university campus of The Islamia University of Bahawalpur, (Punjab) Pakistan. Weekly data was recorded using pit fall traps during spring and fall seasons, 2018. The total sampling efforts of 192 hours in each land-use type resulted in 2842 individuals of 115 taxa. Hymenoptera-largely comprising of three ant species, Monomorium indicum, Monomorium pharaonis and Camponotus angusticollis -was the most abundant taxon in all the four land-use types followed by Coleoptera, Arachnida and Hemiptera. The maximum number of distinct species (only found in a specific landscape) was found in grassy plots and the minimum in agricultural landscapes i.e., 24 and 9, respectively. Only five species were found common in all the four landscapes i.e., M. indicum, M. pharaonis, C. angusticollis (ants), Lycosa poonaensis (spider) and Patanga succincta (grasshopper). Agricultural land showed the higher values of evenness and Simpson diversity indices than that of grassy plots, suggesting more even distribution of species. The lowest value of Chao-1 indexes-suggesting the minimum number of rare species in agricultural landscape-further confirmed this finding. Results of present study suggest that agriculture is not a threat to soil arthropods biodiversity except some rare species. Moreover, since grassy plots and forests exhibited greater values of Shannon-Wiener, Simpson and Chao-1 indices than desert, plantation of forests in the desert and establishment of grassy plots within or near the buildings may encourage diversity of soil arthropods and associated taxa in higher tropic levels.

This research aimed to assess domestic garden plants diversity, composition, distribution, and identify the conserved indigenous plant species in a heavily urbanized arid city. Domestic gardens within each district were randomly selected, visited, and surveyed. Cultivated plant species in gardens were identified and counted; their frequencies and abundance levels were calculated. Plant species richness, Shannon, evenness, and Simpson's indices were calculated. More than 12,000 plants belonging to 223 plant species compromising 72 plant families were found. Domestic gardens played a significant role in conserving regionally extinct or endangered native plant species while undesirably sustained exotic and invasive plants. Overall, exotic plants species represented 84% of all identified species. The highest percentage of native plants (29%) was found in Uhod district, while the lowest (11%) was in Jubaiha district. The minimum and maximum proportion of medicinal, poisonous, and fruit bearing plants on a district bases were 9-26%, 9-22%, and 11-43% of domestic garden plants, respectively. The highest species richness (103) was in Zahran, while the lowest (20) was in Al-Madinah district. Shannon diversity index was the highest in Zahran and Sweileh districts. Shannon, evenness, and Simpson diversity indexes revealed Badr Al-Jadidah as the lowest plant diversity district. District history, lots sizes, garden sizes, socioeconomic status, residents' preferences, and housing regulations resulted in variation in plants diversity and species composition. Thus, monitoring species composition in domestic gardens and raising public awareness about plants benefits/risks supports environmental sustainability. Attention should be given to these neglected biodiversity hotspots, especially in arid environments.

The contents of the ceca were collected from ducklings of different groups. The ceca bacterial DNA was isolated and the V3 to V4 regions of 16S rRNA genes were amplified. The amplicons were subjected to high-throughput sequencing to analyze the bacterial diversity of different groups. The predominant bacterial phyla were Bacteroidetes (similar to 65.67%), Firmicutes (similar to 17.46%), and Proteobacteria (similar to 10.73%). The abundance of Bacteroidetes increased and that of Firmicutes decreased with increasing dietary energy level. The diversity decreased (Simpson diversity index and Shannon diversity index) with the increase in dietary energy level, but the richness remained constant. Notably, Brachyspira bacteria were detected with a very high relative abundance (4.91%) in ceca of ducks fed a diet with 11.30 MJ/kg metabolizable energy, suggesting that low energy content may affect their colonization in cecum.					wang, yi/GVT-8516-2022; Wang, Yin/HCI-9352-2022; zhang, cl/JDW-6549-2023; wang, yan/GSE-6489-2022; zhang, chunmei/IUQ-7038-2023; wang, yiran/IAP-0414-2023; wangwangwang, yuanyaunyuan/HHN-6432-2022; Wang, Yanbo/HFZ-8018-2022; Li, Xiaoli/JVZ-4089-2024; Wang, Yuan/HHC-1520-2022; wang, yan/JBJ-7462-2023														1212-1819	1805-9309					2018	63	1					24	31		10.17221/53/2017-CJAS	http://dx.doi.org/10.17221/53/2017-CJAS													WOS:000417135400004

The present paper describes a methodology to estimate plant diversity involving landscape structure as a proportional weight associated with different plant communities found in the landscape mosaic. The area occupied by a plant community, its patch number or its spatial distribution of patches are variables that could be expressed in gamma plant diversity of a territory. The methodology applies (1) remote sensing information, to identify land cover and land use types; (2) aspect, to discriminate composition of plant communities in each land cover type; (3) multi-scale field techniques, to asses plant diversity; (4) affinity analysis of plant community composition, to validate the stratified random sampling design and (5) the additive model that partitions gamma diversity into its alpha and beta components. The method was applied to three Spanish rural areas and was able to record 150-260 species per ha. Species richness, Shannon information index and Simpson concentration index were used to measure diversity in each area. The estimation using Shannon diversity index and the product of patch number and patch interspersion as weighting of plant community diversity was found to be the most appropriate method of measuring plant diversity at the landscape level.

While many such tests are based on an index of lexical richness, we propose to use an entire profile of such indices. Specifically, we evaluate a profile of generalized Simpson's indices for two writing samples and see if the profiles are significantly different or not. We validate our methodology on several poems whose authorship is known. We then apply it to test whether the poem Shall I Die?' which is sometimes attributed to William Shakespeare was, in fact, written by him. Further, we provide R code and a package for R that easily implements this methodology.																			0929-6174	1744-5035					2018	25	2					142	155		10.1080/09296174.2017.1343268	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09296174.2017.1343268													WOS:000427558800003
J	Qian, H				Qian, Hong			A latitudinal gradient of beta diversity for exotic vascular plant species in North America	DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS												Determining relationships between the ranges of introduced species and geographical and environmental factors is an important step in understanding the mechanisms and processes of the spread of introduced species. In this study, I examined the beta diversity and latitude relationship for all naturalized exotic species of vascular plants in North America at a continental scale. Beta diversity was calculated as the absolute value of the slope of the relationship between the natural logarithm of the Simpson index of similarity (lnS) and spatial distance between pairs of state-level exotic floras within four latitudinal zones examined. Relative contributions of spatial distance and environmental difference to species turnover between exotic floras were examined. I found that beta diversity decreased monotonically from low to high latitudes: beta diversity for the southernmost zone was shallower than that for the northernmost zone by a factor of 2.6. Regression models of lnS in relation to spatial distance and environmental (climatic and topographical) difference for each latitudinal zone demonstrated that the explanatory power of these variables diminishes monotonically with latitude: the explained variance in lnS is 70.4%, 62.1%, 53.9%, and 33.9%, respectively, for the four latitudinal zones from south to north. For the southernmost zone, 58.3% of the variance in lnS is explained by climate variables and topography, and spatial distance explains only 2.3% of the variance. In contrast, for the northernmost zone, more than half the amount (22.5%) of the explained variance in lnS is attributable to spatial distance, and the remaining (18.9%) of the explained variance is attributable to climate variables and topography.																			1366-9516	1472-4642				MAY	2008	14	3					556	560		10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00466.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1472-4642.2008.00466.x													WOS:000254946900012
J	Sklenár, P				Sklenar, Petr			Presence of cushion plants increases community diversity in the high equatorial Andes	FLORA												Cushion plants are a common growth form in the equatorial paramo vegetation and their surfaces are often colonized by other plants. This paper analyzes the effect of the cushion plants on the community diversity at 4650 in on the eastern slope of the Iliniza volcano in Ecuador. Ninety sample plots of 1 m(2) size were located in the study area and were divided into 25 subplots in which presence and abundance of plant species was recorded. The community diversity was expressed as species richness, Simpson's diversity index, and evenness. Correlation between the cushion species and the composition of the colonists was measured with the CCA ordination analysis, correlation between the cushion cover and community diversity was measured by means of correlation analysis. Randomized species-area curves were used to compare richness of plant communities with and without the cushions. A total of 32 species were found including five cushion plants. Most species preferred to grow on the cushion surface whereas only a few species were able to colonize open ground. Species richness and Simpson's index were significantly correlated to the cushion area but no correlation was found for evenness. The cushions were usually composed of more than one species which hampered the examination of the cushion-colonist specific relationships. Nevertheless, cushions of Azorella and Arenaria seemed to provide more favorable habitat for colonization than the other cushion species. Comparison with an earlier study made on Iliniza indicates that the presence of the cushions significantly increases the richness of the plant community. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH.

Information about living environment-related factors was collected with repeated questionnaires. Dust samples were collected from baby's living rooms and feces samples were collected at 1 month of age. After bacterial DNA extraction and examination by PCR of 16S rDNA V3 Region, bacterial community profilings were obtained by use of denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Quantity One and Biodap softwares were used for diversity and similarity analysis, and SPSS software was used for statistical analysis. Lifestyles associated with improved hygiene were significantly different in rural and urban regions (P < 0.05). The microbial exposure in rural living environments was significantly higher as compared to the Stripe number (S'), Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index (H'), Pielou Index (E) and Simpson index (D) in the urban group (P < 0.05). The Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index (H') and Pielou Index (E) for the rural intestinal microbiota were significantly higher than those of the urban group (P < 0.05). The Stripe number (S') and Simpson index (D) for the rural intestinal microbiota were slightly higher than those of the urban group means, although the differences between them were not significant (P > 0.05). The structures of both environmental bacteria and intestinalmicrobiota were more similar in the same region. There were significantly positive leaner correlations between the environmental microbial exposures and intestinal microbiota in the Stripe number (S') and Shannon-Weaver Diversity Index (H') (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the rural and urban living environments, especially microbial exposures, are significantly different and this difference can influence the intestinal microbiota in early infancy.																			1941-4900	1941-4919				MAY	2017	9	5					761	769		10.1166/nnl.2017.2283	http://dx.doi.org/10.1166/nnl.2017.2283													WOS:000405312800021

Gut microbiome, body weight, and mammographic breast density in healthy postmenopausal women	CANCER CAUSES & CONTROL												Purpose We examined gut microbiome (GM) profiles in relation to mammographic breast density (BD) and body mass index (BMI) in healthy postmenopausal women. Methods Eligible women were postmenopausal, had a BMI <= 35 kg/m(2), and had not recently taken oral/IV antibiotics. All women provided a fecal sample and information on breast cancer risk factors. Mammographic BD was classified with the American College of Radiology's BI-RADS BD classification system. Bacterial DNA was isolated from fecal samples and the V1-V2 hypervariable regions of 16S rRNA were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform. We examined associations of GM with indices of within-sample (alpha) diversity and the ratio of the two main phyla (Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes; F/B ratio) with BD and BMI. Results Among 69 women with BD data, 39 had low BD (BI-RADS I/II) and 30 had high BD (BI-RADS III/IV). BMI was inversely associated with BD (mean BMI = 23.8 and 28.0 in women with high and low BD, respectively, p = 1.07 x 10(-5)). Similar levels of GM diversity were found across weight groups according to Shannon (p = 0.83); Inverse Simpson (p = 0.97); and Chao1 (p = 0.31) indices. F/B ratio and microbiota diversity were suggestively greater in women with high vs. low BD (p = 0.35, 0.14, 0.15, and 0.17 for F/B ratio, Shannon, Inverse Simpson and Chao1, respectively). Conclusion Suggestive differences observed in women with high and low BD with respect to GM alpha diversity and prevalence of specific GM taxa need to be confirmed in larger studies.																			0957-5243	1573-7225				2021 JUL	2021	32	7					681	692		10.1007/s10552-021-01420-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10552-021-01420-6		MAR 2021						33772705					WOS:000633758800001

A total of 75 fish species were identified, of which 53 % were Cypriniformes, followed by Siluriformes (15 %), Perciformes (14 %), Channiformes (7 %) and Clupeiformes (4 %). Among the identified taxa 42 species were not threatened, 12 vulnerable, 11 endangered and 8 critically endangered. The values of diversity indices explicitly Shannon-Weiner (H'), Pielou evenness (J'), Margalef richness (d) and Simpson dominance (c) indices indicated that Tanguarhaorwasmore diversified and evenly distributed than Dekharhaor. For effective management of the haorscomprehensive stock assessment, establishment of fish sanctuaries, and combination of input and output control is suggested.					Hossain, Md.

Using open-source data on global tree inventories, this study examines (1) the diversity of species, genera, and family of urban street trees in eight cities internationally; (2) how they score on diversity benchmarks and indices; and (3) the diversity variation inside and outside of cities' centers. We hypothesized most cities would score poorly on diversity benchmarks and spatial patterns in species composition would exist, as illustrated by established relationships between urban density and urban tree diversity. Results indicate city centers were less likely to approach the proposed diversity benchmarks than outside the city center. Overall, both Shannon and Simpson diversity indices show greater diversity outside of the city center, especially at the species-level. Understanding street tree diversity and spatial variation patterns across cities internationally can offer needed evidence to back up heuristic benchmarks. The methodology and open-source data used in this study are intended to enable practitioners better target tree diversity efforts.

If the effects of grazing on plant diversity have been extensively studied in a wide range of ecosystems, effects of controlled grazing are still largely unknown. Species diversity indices are useful indicators of the sustainability of collective rangelands in southern Tunisia. In order to determine an optimal management method of arid rangelands with high heritage value, we examined the respective effects of continuous grazing, moderate grazing and rest on the plant community's diversity. We compared diversity indices of the vegetation for three levels of grazing pressure (null, moderate and heavy) in the collective rangelands dominated by Gymnocarpos decander, Hammada schmittiana, Stipagrostis pungens and Anthyllis sericea of Dhahars in the south-eastern region of Tataouine (Tunisia). Species richness and Simpson's diversity tended to decrease with increased grazing pressure, but the difference was not significant between ungrazed and moderately grazed rangelands. By contrast, species evenness tended to increase with grazing pressure. Diversity and vegetation biological spectrum were only slightly affected by controlled grazing. This study demonstrates the value of this management practice for biodiversity conservation.

Nine study sites (small lakes and their surrounding vegetation) represent land cover gradient from closed forest to semi-open vegetation. Floristic richness (number of species) and floristic richness of pollen types (number of pollen-equivalent taxa) were used to describe the vegetation within the radius of 250 m from the pollen sampling sites. Palynological richness was calculated to describe the modern pollen samples diversity. Landscape structure was estimated on the basis of landscape openness and three landscape diversity measures: richness of community patches, Simpson evenness of community patches and Simpson diversity of community patches. To study the effect of the spatial scale of landscapes on the vegetation-landscape and pollen-landscape associations, landscape structure was estimated within eight radii (250-2,000 m) around each lake. The results showed that landscape openness was the most important determinant of both floristic richness and palynological richness in southern Estonia and that landscape diversity estimated by Simpson diversity index was also significantly associated with the richness estimates. Floristic and palynological richness were significantly positively correlated with landscape structure within the radii greater than 1,000 m from the pollen sampling sites, which is similar to the estimated Relevant Source Area of Pollen in southern Estonia. We conclude that within one floristic or climatic region, palynological richness gives reliable estimates about the variation in floristic richness and landscape structure; however, caution must be taken when comparing pollen-inferred vegetation diversities from different regions or when interpreting fossil pollen records from times with highly different vegetation associations.

A metagenomic approach in a tropical hotspot of biodiversity	PLANT AND SOIL												Aims Understanding how soil aggregate stability (MWD) is influenced by microbial diversity and abundance can be crucial for ecological restoration in severely disturbed areas. We investigated the relationships between plant and soil microbial diversity and MWD of an ultramafic Ferralsol along a vegetational succession gradient in New Caledonia, where wildfires and extensive nickel mining have degraded the landscape. Methods Five plant communities were studied. For each one, MWD, soil physicochemical parameters (e.g. soil organic carbon (SOC)), plant root traits and fungal abundance were measured. The diversity and structure of plant and microbial communities were respectively assessed via botanical inventories and a metagenomic approach. A generalized linear model (GLM) was used to assess the influence of diversity indexes on MWD. Constrained ordinations (CCA) were performed to assess the influence of communities' structures on MWD. Results GLM highlighted the linkage between SOC and MWD but did not identify any significant influence of diversity indexes on MWD. CCA revealed a significant influence of communities' structures, especially the abundance of saprotrophic fungi, on MWD. Conclusions We showed that the structure, but not species richness and diversity of plants, soil fungi and bacteria influence aggregate stability on Ferralsols.

A prospective study of the adaptive changes in the gut microbiome during standard-of-care chemoradiotherapy for gynecologic cancers	PLOS ONE												Background A diverse and abundant gut microbiome can improve cancer patients' treatment response; however, the effect of pelvic chemoradiotherapy (CRT) on gut diversity and composition is unclear. The purpose of this prospective study was to identify changes in the diversity and composition of the gut microbiome during and after pelvic CRT. Materials and methods Rectal swabs from 58 women with cervical, vaginal, or vulvar cancer from two institutions were prospectively analyzed before CRT (baseline), during CRT (weeks 1, 3, and 5), and at first follow-up (week 12) using 16Sv4 rRNA gene sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rRNA marker gene. 42 of these patients received antibiotics during the study period. Observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs; representative of richness) and Shannon, Simpson, Inverse Simpson, and Fisher diversity indices were used to characterize alpha (within-sample) diversity. Changes over time were assessed using a paired t-test, repeated measures ANOVA, and linear mixed modeling. Compositional changes in specific bacteria over time were evaluated using linear discriminant analysis effect size. Results Gut microbiome richness and diversity levels continually decreased throughout CRT (mean Shannon diversity index, 2.52 vs. 2.91; all P < 0.01), but were at or near baseline levels in 60% of patients by week 12. Patients with higher gut diversity at baseline had the steepest decline in gut microbiome diversity. Gut microbiome composition was significantly altered during CRT, with increases in Proteobacteria and decreases in Clostridiales, but adapted after CRT, with increases in Bacteroides species. Conclusion After CRT, the diversity of the gut microbiomes in this population tended to return to baseline levels by the 12 week follow-up period, but structure and composition remained significantly altered. These changes should be considered when designing studies to analyze the gut microbiome in patients who receive pelvic CRT for gynecologic cancers.

The aim of this research was to estimate its mammalian diversity. Direct trapping was used to capture small mammals and camera-trapping for the study of medium and large mammals. Diversity was calculated from Margalef's index, dominance and equity were evaluated through Simpson's and Shannon-Wiener indexes, respectively. Fifty three species were registered, 3 of them are the first record for the State of Mexico, 10 are endemic to Mexico and 4 are considered in some category of vulnerability by the Mexican government. The area is inhabited by 5 of the 6 Mexican felid species. The mastofaunistic composition of SNRN was compared with that of the Sierra Purepecha, Michoacan, according to Jaccard's index, the similarity between them is low, sharing 38% of species. Considering the results, it is clear the importance of SNNR, regarding its mastofaunistic diversity, and the need to implement strategies for its conservation.

Diversity of Gene Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells	GENOMICS PROTEOMICS & BIOINFORMATICS												Understanding tumor diversity has been a long-lasting and challenging question for researchers in the field of cancer heterogeneity or tumor evolution. Studies have reported that compared to normal cells, there is a higher genetic diversity in tumor cells, while higher genetic diversity is associated with higher progression risks of tumor. We thus hypothesized that tumor diversity also holds true at the gene expression level. To test this hypothesis, we used t-test to compare the means of Simpson's diversity index for gene expression (SDIG) between tumor and non-tumor samples. We found that the mean SDIG in tumor tissues is significantly higher than that in the non-tumor or normal tissues (P < 0.05) for most datasets. We also combined microarrays and next-generation sequencing data for validation. This cross-platform and cross-experimental validation greatly increased the reliability of our results.																			1672-0229	2210-3244				DEC	2015	13	6					377	382		10.1016/j.gpb.2015.07.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gpb.2015.07.003								26779818					WOS:000369604900007

This study analyses data from a 40-year experiment established at two sites in the Czech Republic in 1972. The impact of herbicide strategies on the weed communities was evaluated in multi-crop rotation (MCR) with 50% cereals, and simple crop rotations (SCR) with 75% cereals. The following two herbicide strategies were compared: (1) simple treatment with synthetic auxins only in the simple crop rotation, and (2) targeted herbicide combinations with particular use of sulfonylureas, triazines, ureas and synthetic auxins. Untreated plots were included for reference purposes. Results showed that crop was the major factor determining weed community composition and explained 18% of the total variation in the case of untreated controls. However, herbicide treatment reduced the crop effect to 11%. The highest average increase of Shannon's diversity index was by 25.4% after 44 years at the untreated plots in SCR, and it decreased by 15.1% at the treated plots in MCR. Weed species evenness euro increased at all plots by an average of 23%. Simpson's dominance index decreased at untreated plots in both crop rotations and plots treated with auxins, with the highest 44.8% decrease at the untreated plots in SCR. On the contrary, Simpson's index increased by 33,3% on the treated plots in MCR. Herbicide selection depended on the occurrence and density of target weed species, and led to greater decrease in weed diversity and population densities in the diversified crop rotations.

Tree species diversity and basal area heterogeneity in forest ecosystems are quantified using the Shannon-Weaver and Simpson indices, The relationship between tree species diversity, basal area heterogeneity, stand parameters and geomorphology features are examined using regression analysis. Our work revealed that the relationship between tree species diversity and stand parameters is loose with a correlation coefficient between 0.02 and 0.70. The correlation of basal area heterogeneity with stand parameters fluctuated between 0.004 and 0.77 (RI). According to our results, stands with higher tree species diversity are characterised by higher mean stand diameter number of diameter classes, basal area and lower homogeneity index value. Considering the effect of geomorphology features on tree species or basal area heterogeneity, we found that all investigated relationships are loose with R-2 <= 0.24. A significant correlation was detected only between tree species diversity and aspect Future work is required to verify the detected trends in behaviour of tree species diversity if it is to estimate from the usual forest stand parameters and topography characteristics.

A set of 76 strains were screened from total of 438 strains that exhibit plant growthpromoting (PGP) and antagonistic potential isolated from sites PS1 (Mehsana district), BS2 (Dantiwada district) and VS3 (Gandhinagar district). Their diversity indices were studied for determining the species richness and evenness of screened isolates. Results revealed that site BS2 showed the most significant diversity indices in terms of Shannon (H' 1.525) and Simpson (1/D 5.120) than other two samples. Principal component analysis showed that bacterial diversity (H') was correlated with the soil characteristics. Chickpea and groundnut plants inoculated with MBCU1 and MBCU3 isolates showed an increase in the vegetative growth parameters that evaluate plant growth when compared to uninoculated controls. Strains MBCU1 and MBCU3 were identified as Pseudomonas stutzeri and Pseudomonas mosselii, respectively, according to sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene. These both isolates belong to site BS2 and they showed specific PGP traits suggesting that these isolates can promote plant growth by more than one mechanism with respect to their higher diversity index.

To assist such efforts, we investigated relationships between fertilization treatments and depth-related characteristics of the weed seed bank (density, species composition and diversity) under a wheat-soybean rotation after long-term (16 years) fertilization. Numbers of weed species present and the Shannon-Wiener index were significantly lower under NPK, NP, NK, and PK fertilization treatments than under the fertilization-free control treatment (CK), and the vertical distribution of dominant species differed under the treatments. Generally, the species richness and Shannon-Wiener index decreased and the Pielou index increased with increases in soil depth, but the relationship of the Simpson index with depth was complex and unclear. The results show that effects of considered fertilization treatments on weeds warrant careful attention, and that PK fertilization would be optimal for suppressing weeds in the wheat-soybean rotation system studied.

Nineteen species of Fusarium were isolated representing sections Eupionnotes, Sporotrichiella, Discolor, Gibbosum, Arthrosporiella, Liseola, Elegans, Martiella, and Lateritium. Fusarium oxysporum, F. equiseti, F. semitectum, F. nygamai, and F. solani were isolated most frequently and F. oxysporum was the predominant species isolated from all samples. Other species recovered were F. chlamydosporum, F. merismoides, F. lateritium, F. culmorum, F. compactum, F. dlamini, F. poae, F. proliferatum, F. moniliforme, F. graminearum, F. sambucinum, F. napiforme, and three unknown populations. Using Simpson's index, the diversity indices calculated for Fusarium species from debris and soil from each sampling site indicate that overall debris was a greater source of species diversity than soil. Diversity indices calculated for each altitude sample and each isolation technique showed that the sea level site yielded the most diverse population.																			0027-5514					NOV-DEC	1990	82	6					727	733		10.2307/3760159	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3760159													WOS:A1990EQ56900006

We used bivariate correlations between land use and land cover mix (estimated separately by Simpson's index), population, race, age, education, and commuting modes. Major findings indicate that land use mix is positively related to public transportation use while the land cover mix is negatively related; the opposite is found for both diversity measures and working from home. Greater land cover diversity discourages walking and biking and encourages car commuting; Blacks are the majority who use public transportation; older travelers are more likely to use transportation alternatives; higher-educated people tend to work from home or commute by bike. This study helps city planners in designing sustainable cities and increasing active modes use. Understanding travel patterns may help policymakers to control local/regional problems like increasing traffic congestions and emissions due to a modal shift in commuting to a private car during a COVID19 pandemic, as well as develop strategies for encouraging active modes and public transport use in the postCOVID-19 world.

The purpose of this study was to research and survey the effects of transgenic insect-resistant cottons that had been planted over 10 years on the abundance and community structure of soil invertebrates under field conditions. During 3 consecutive years (2006-2008), eight common taxa (orders) of soil invertebrates belonging to the phylum Arthropoda were investigated in two different transgenic cotton fields and one non-transgenic cotton field (control). Each year, soil samples were taken at four different growth stages of cotton (seedling, budding, boll forming and boll opening). Animals were extracted from the samples using the improved Tullgren method, counted and determined to the order level. The diversity of the soil fauna communities in the different fields was compared using the Simpson's, Shannon's diversity indices and evenness index. The results showed a significant sampling time variation in the abundance of soil invertebrates monitored in the different fields. However, no difference in soil invertebrate abundance was found between the transgenic cotton fields and the control field. Both sampling time and cotton treatment had a significant effect on the Simpson's, Shannon's diversity indices and evenness index. They were higher in the transgenic fields than the control field at the growth stages of cotton. Long-term cultivation of transgenic insect-resistant cottons had no significant effect on the abundance of soil invertebrates. Collembola, Acarina and Araneae could act as the indicators of soil invertebrate in this region to monitor the environmental impacts of transgenic plants in the future.					li, xiaogang/ABH-2977-2020														1464-0325	1464-0333				MAR	2012	14	3					1055	1063		10.1039/c2em10378h	http://dx.doi.org/10.1039/c2em10378h								22334084					WOS:000300875100035

In this study, we propose a multifractal analysis for metagenomic research. Method and ResultsFirstly, we visualized the chaotic game representation (CGR) of simulated metagenomes and real metagenomes. We find that metagenomes are visualized with self-similarity. Then we defined and calculated the multifractal dimension for the visualized plot of simulated and real metagenomes, respectively. By analyzing the Pearson correlation coefficients between the multifractal dimension and the traditional species diversity index, we obtain that the correlation coefficients between the multifractal dimension and the species richness index and Shannon diversity index reached the maximum value when q = 0, 1, and the correlation coefficient between the multifractal dimension and the Simpson diversity index reached the maximum value when q = 5. Finally, we apply our method to real metagenomes of the gut microbiota of 100 infants who are newborn and 4 and 12 months old. The results show that the multifractal dimensions of an infant's gut microbiomes can distinguish age differences. Conclusion and DiscussionThere is self-similarity among the CGRs of WGS of metagenomes, and the multifractal spectrum is an important characteristic for metagenomes. The traditional diversity indicators can be unified under the framework of multifractal analysis. These results coincided with similar results in macrobial ecology. The multifractal spectrum of infants' gut microbiomes are related to the development of the infants.																			2235-2988					JAN 26	2023	13								1117421	10.3389/fcimb.2023.1117421	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2023.1117421								36779183					WOS:000931289100001
J	Camilo, GD; Terra, BD; Araújo, FG				Camilo, Geysa da Silva; Terra, Bianca de Freitas; Araujo, Francisco Gerson			Using the relationship between taxonomic and functional diversity to assess functional redundancy in streams of an altered tropical watershed	ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES												The relationship between taxonomic and functional diversity indices has been used to better describe and understand the structure of biological communities. Functional diversity is expected to have an asymptotic relationship with species richness because at some point, the addition of new species will increase some of the already established functional groups (functional redundancy). However, the asymptotic relationship may not be reached in intermediately disturbed systems once many intolerant species that would have played a redundant role or even represented some functional groups have been lost. This study aimed to address such a relationship (taxonomic and functional indices) and to evaluate the functional redundancy in intermediately disturbed streams in the Atlantic Rainforest domain. We expected a positive linear relationship between taxonomic and functional diversity; however, we did not expect to find an asymptotic relationship between richness and functional diversity because of the loss of many intolerant species caused by anthropogenic uses. The taxonomic diversity indices were Species Richness (SR) and Simpson's Diversity (SD), while the functional diversity indices were the Functional Richness (FRic) and Functional Dispersion (FDisp). The two taxonomic and two functional diversity indices showed a significant positive relationship that never reached an asymptote, suggesting low functional redundancy in the fish communities. Our results indicate that care is needed in the management of the studied streams because assemblies with low functional redundancy are more susceptible to loss of functions in the case of species loss.					de Freitas Terra, Bianca/D-5004-2015	de Freitas Terra, Bianca/0000-0003-0229-2388; Araujo, Francisco Gerson/0000-0003-4551-1974													0378-1909	1573-5133				SEP	2018	101	9					1395	1405		10.1007/s10641-018-0786-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-018-0786-3													WOS:000440766900008

Ant species richness and evenness increase along a metal pollution gradient in the Boleslaw zinc smelter area	PEDOBIOLOGIA												Ants are considered to be relatively resistant to metal pollution, but the effect of metal toxicity on ant communities is poorly understood. This work examined the relationship between ant species diversity and heavy metal pollution at 16 meadow and forest sites along a metal contamination gradient in a mining and smelting region near Olkusz, Poland. Menhinick's index was used to estimate species richness. Pielou's index of evenness (J), Simpson's index of diversity (D) and the slopes of rank-abundance curves were used to estimate of species evenness. Regardless of species composition differences between forest and meadow, the increase in species diversity with increasing metal. pollution was very clear in both ecosystems. The more polluted the site, the more species were detected and the more similar in relative abundance they were. Consequently, the extent to which one or a few species dominated a community decreased. This result can be explained by indirect effects of metal pollution, that is, changes in species interactions rather than by changes in abiotic conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Although soil biodiversity declined with the decrease of plant diversity, many previous studies found plant species identities were more important than plant diversity in controlling soil biodiversity. This study focused on the responses of soil biodiversity to the altering of plant functional groups, namely overstory and understory vegetations, rather than plant diversity gradient. We conducted an experiment by removing overstory and/or understory vegetation to compare their effects on soil microbial phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) and nematode diversities in eucalyptus monocultures. Our results indicated that both overstory and understory vegetations could affect soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities, which manifested as the decrease in Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') and Pielou evenness index (J) and the increase in Simpson dominance index (lambda) after vegetation removal. Soil microclimate change explained part of variance of soil biodiversity indices. Both overstory and understory vegetations positively correlated with soil microbial PLFA and nematode diversities. In addition, the alteration of soil biodiversity might be due to a mixing effect of bottom-up control and soil microclimate change after vegetation removal in the studied plantations. Given the studied ecosystem is common in humid subtropical and tropical region of the world, our findings might have great potential to extrapolate to large scales and could be conducive to ecosystem management and service.

To identify the deciding environment gradient the data from the parallel phytocoenological and pedological observations were subjected to the canonical correspondence analysis carried out by the program CANOCO. The forest stands were differentiated according to the content of humus and granulometric composition of the soil. The analysis carried out by the program Fytan was one of the methods used for evaluation of ecological conditions by means of the Ellenberg's indication values. Its results confirm a relatively high habitat variability and, when comparing with the literature data, also a lower humidity. The Simpson's index of diversity lambda, Shannon-Weaver's index H', species richness index R1 (Margalef) and R2 (Menhinick) and indices of evenness E1 - E3 were used for evaluation of species richness and diversity of the studied stands.

Data processing such as splicing, filtering, removing chimeric sequences, and cluster analysis was then performed based on the raw data, and the tax was annotated with OTU. When the air-treated soil samples were compared with the ones treated with hydrogen at a concentration of 1100 ppm and 1300 ppm, the abundance of Proteobacteria increased and Actinobacteria decreased for the later. In addition the Simpson index decreased and the Shannon index increased significantly for both hydrogen-treated samples. However, for the soil sample treated with 1500 ppm of hydrogen, the above-mentioned two indexes didnot vary obviously compared with the air-treated sample. The results demonstrated that the rhizosphere bacterial structure diversity of soybean was significantly increased after hydrogen treatment at the concentration of 1100 and 1300 ppm.

The species diversity of artificial-natural plant community four years later was calculated by the measurable description of species richness index, Simpson index, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index, community evenness. The main results are as follows: (1) The artificial-natural communities are formed since several native species naturally occurred or invaded to the artificial communities in four years. (2)The species diversity is obviously increased in the artificial-natural communities. And there are all 26 species belonging to 12 families, 25 genera in the study communities, including 3 species of arbor, 9 species of shrub or semi-shrub, and 13 kinds of herbage, 1 vine species. (3)The variety range of Shannon-Wiener index (H') is 2.08-3.99 in 9 communities, and its trend is similar to that of richness changes. (4)Comm. Halogeton glomeratus+Karelinia caspica has the highest diversity and evenness indices while Comm. Calligonum caput-medusae+Populus euphratica is on the contrary. The results may provide the relevant theories for the further optimization species composition of the wind-breaking and sand-fixing forest and enhancement the stability of artificial plant community in the ecological fragile area.																					978-7-03-021073-9				2008							181	184																WOS:000256004300040

In this paper, a spatial method for the assessment of the geodiversity of Basilicata region in southern Italy is proposed through the use of fragmentation indexes. The fragmentation indices use the values derived from the overlay of three different maps: i) landform map; ii) climate map; iii) geological map. Three indexes have been applied to obtain the geodiversity of the study area: i) Shannon's diversity index (SHDI); ii) Shannon's Evenness Index (SHEI); iii) Simpson's Diversity Index (SIDI). The results show how the three indices offer similar results. High values of geodiversity can be observed: i) in the frontal sector of the chain; ii) where the complexity of the landscape forms is high. Low values of geodiversity are observed in the Ionian coast belt. These results can represent a basic but valuable tool for the delineation of the main macro-areas with different geodiversity values.

In this article, we apply multifractals to the species-area relationship and species abundance distributions. We highlight two results: first, species abundance distributions collected at different spatial scales may collapse into a single curve after appropriate renormalization, and second, the power-law form of the species-area relationship and the Shannon, Simpson, and Berger-Parker diversity indices belong to a family of equations relating the species number, species abundance, and area through the moments of the species abundance-probability density function. Explicit formulas for these diversity indices, as a function of area, are derived. Methods to obtain the multifractal spectra from a data set are discussed, and an example is shown with data on tree and shrub species collected in a 50-ha plot on Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Finally, we discuss the implications of the multifractal formalism to the relationship between species range and abundance and the relation between the shape of the species abundance distribution and area.

J	Arita, HT				Arita, Hector T.			Multisite and multispecies measures of overlap, co-occurrence, and co-diversity	ECOGRAPHY												Several indices measure the association or segregation between two species and the similarity or differentiation between two sets of species. These indices are based on the overlap in the distribution of species (measured with the number of co-occurrences) or on the overlap in species composition of sites (measured with the number of species that are shared between two sites). This paper shows that when evaluating more than two species the number of overlaps and the number of pairwise co-occurrences are not equal, as it is the case for two species. Equivalently, when comparing more than two species assemblages, the number of overlaps differ from the number of instances of species sharing by pairs of sites (the ` co-diversities'). Considering this distinction, two different types of multispecies and multisite indices can be derived: indices of general overlap and indices of co-occurrence or co-diversity. Here I present a complete series of the two types of indices that correspond to the popular Jaccard, Sorensen, and Simpson two-species or two-site indices. Indices of general overlap are defined by three parameters (the total number of species, the total number of sites, and the total number of occurrences), whereas indices of co-occurrence or co-diversity depend on those parameters plus an additional one that is defined by the values of species richness or range size. Consequently, the two types of indices respond differently to null models, depending on the parameters that are fixed or randomized. All indices correlate well with the mean of the traditional indices calculated pair by pair, and the correspondence is extremely close for the new indices of co-occurrence and co-diversity. These properties should be useful in clarifying some of the confusion that exists in the current discussion about the advantages and disadvantages of pairwise vs community-wide approaches in the analysis of diversity.

The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate whether the gut microbiota is altered in acne. Faecal bacterial diversity was analysed in 43 patients with acne and 43 controls, using hypervariable tag sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rDNA gene. Distinct differences were found in microbial diversity between patients with acne and controls (Shannon diversity index (p = 0.009) and Simpson diversity index (p = 0.01)). At the phylum level, the abundance of Firmicutes was lower in the patient group, but that of Bacteroidiain was higher. The most significantly depleted taxa in acne were Clostridia, Clostridiales, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae genera, which are potentially beneficial. In conclusion, patients with acne vulgaris have gut microbial dysbiosis; further study is needed to understand its role in the pathogenesis of acne.

The goal of this study was to assess the richness and diversity of edible aquatic insects living in rice fields. A sampling of aquatic insects and physico-chemical parameters of the rice field water were made after irrigation. Three replications of sampling by aquatic net were collected from the bottom along the edge of the rice plots. The richness and diversity indices were analyzed. A total of 10.501 individuals, comprising 64 genera of aquatic insects belonging to six orders, were collected at different study sites. Among aquatic insects, the order Hemiptera occupied the highest abundance of the total insects collected. Richness showed a range of 14 to 50. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H ') showed a range of 1.877 to 3.450, whereas Simpson`s diversity index (D) showed a range of 0.7665 to 0.9605. CCA and non-parametric Spearman correlation revealed that some insect species were correlated positively with pH, temperature, turbidity, alkalinity, and nutrients (nitrate and phosphate), and had a negative correlation with electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids.

J	Hernandez-Stefanoni, JL; Ponce-Hernandez, R				Hernandez-Stefanoni, J. Luis; Ponce-Hernandez, Raul			Mapping the spatial variability of plant diversity in a tropical forest: Comparison of spatial interpolation methods	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Knowledge of the spatial distribution of plant species is essential to conservation and forest managers in order to identify high priority areas such as vulnerable species and habitats, and designate areas for reserves, refuges and other protected areas. A reliable map of the diversity of plant species over the landscape is an invaluable tool for such purposes. In this study, the number of species, the exponent Shannon and the reciprocal Simpson indices, calculated from 141 quadrat sites sampled in a tropical forest were used to compare the performance of several spatial interpolation techniques used to prepare a map of plant diversity, starting from sample ( point) data over the landscape. Means of mapped classes, inverse distance functions, kriging and co-kriging, both, applied over the entire studied landscape and also applied within vegetation classes, were the procedures compared. Significant differences in plant diversity indices between classes demonstrated the usefulness of boundaries between vegetation types, mapped through satellite image classification, in stratifying the variability of plant diversity over the landscape. These mapped classes, improved the accuracy of the interpolation methods when they were used as prior information for stratification of the area. Spatial interpolation by co-kriging performed among the poorest interpolators due to the poor correlation between the plant diversity variables and vegetation indices computed by remote sensing and used as covariables. This indicated that the latter are not suitable covariates of plant diversity indices. Finally, a within- class kriging interpolator yielded the most accurate estimates of plant diversity values. This interpolator not only provided the most accurate estimates by accounting for the indices' intra-class variability, but also provided additional useful interpretations of the structure of spatial variability of diversity values through the interpretation of their semi-variograms. This additional role was found very useful in aiding decisions in conservation planning.

Samples of the soil 0-20 cm layer were randomly collected in each ecosystem in July, 2010 (dry season) and January, 2011 (rainy season). Spores were extracted, counted, and identified. The spore density and density of each species of AMF were estimated. The frequency of occurrence, Shannon diversity index, and Simpson diversity index were calculated for each species. Multivariate clustering analysis was carried out, considering the number of AMF of each species. The results showed a trend of higher number of spores in the Cerrado forest ecosystem, regardless of the soil texture or season, when compared to pasture and silvopasture areas. The Glomus macrocarpum species presented 100% frequency of occurrence in the rainy season in both soil textures. The effects of texture and seasonality on the composition and diversity of AMF communities was more expressive in the Cerrado forest ecosystem. The climate, soil texture, and land use and management affected the composition and diversity of AMF species.					berbara, ricardo l/AAE-4318-2020; Pereira, Marcos/F-1585-2018; Berbara, Ricardo Luis Louro/F-6672-2012	berbara, ricardo l/0000-0002-9133-7754; Pereira, Marcos/0000-0002-1402-3612; Figueira da Silva, Cristiane/0000-0003-4606-3149; Berbara, Ricardo Luis Louro/0000-0002-3649-9443; Caproni, Ana Lucy/0000-0002-7795-3075													0100-316X	1983-2125				JAN-MAR	2022	35	1					170	180		10.1590/1983-21252022v35n117rc	http://dx.doi.org/10.1590/1983-21252022v35n117rc													WOS:000734943200017

The main goal of this study was verify the importance and effectiveness of the high diversity of arboreal species originated from a reforestation, and its influence in a woody regenerating composition. We developed a phytosociologic study in a woody regenerating stratum of a nine year old reforestation at a Private Reserve of Natural Heritage (RPPN), in Mogi-Guacu, Sao Paulo State. All specimens with height >= 30 cm and Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) < 5 cm were evaluated. The woody regenerating diversity was smaller than the overstory diversity and the species composition was similar to the overstory. The Simpson index (1-D) was 0.85, Shannon index (H') was 2.46 and the Pielou index (J') was 0.60. The zoochoric dispersion syndrome was major among the species. Our results suggest that the use of high diversity of native seedlings in a reforestation leads to high diversity of species in woody regeneration stratum, after one decade of planting.

The objective of the present study was to statistically investigate relationships between bacterial and fungal diversity indexes (richness, evenness, Shannon index, inverse Simpson index) and decomposition of different pools of soil organic carbon by measuring dynamics of CO2 emissions under controlled conditions. To this end, 20 soils from two different land uses (cropland and grassland) were incubated with or without incorporation of C-13-labelled wheat-straw residue. C-13-labelling allowed us to study residue mineralisation, basal respiration and the priming effect independently. An innovative data-mining approach was applied, based on generalized additive models and a predictive criterion. Results showed that microbial diversity indexes can be good covariates to integrate in SOC dynamics models, depending on the C source and the processes considered (native soil organic carbon vs. fresh wheat residue). Specifically, microbial diversity indexes were good candidates to help explain mineralisation of native soil organic carbon, while priming effect processes seemed to be explained much more by microbial composition, and no microbial diversity indexes were found associated with residue mineralisation. Investigation of relationships between diversity and mineralisation showed that higher diversity, as measured by the microbial diversity indexes, seemed to be related to decreased CO2 emissions in the control soil. We suggest that this relationship can be explained by an increase in carbon yield assimilation as microbial diversity increases. Thus, the parameter for carbon yield assimilation in mathematical models could be calculated as a function of microbial diversity indexes. Nonetheless, given limitations of the methods used, these observations should be considered with caution and confirmed with more experimental studies. Overall, along with other studies on relationships between microbial community composition and SOM dynamics, this study suggests that overall measures of microbial diversity may constitute relevant ways to include microbial diversity in models of SOM dynamics.

We conducted a field campaign of tree species measurements to achieve this objective for species diversity estimation. Thirty-five field plots of 50 m x 20 m were established, and the most dominant tree species within the forest were identified. Other measurements, such as diameter at breast height (DBH >= 5 cm), tree height, and each plot's GPS coordinates, were recorded. The following species diversity indices were estimated from the field measurements: Shannon-Wiener (H '), Simpson diversity index (D2), species richness (S), and species evenness (J '). The PlanetScope surface reflectance data at 3 m spatial resolution was acquired and preprocessed for species diversity prediction. The spectral/pixel information of all bands, except the coastal band, was extracted for further processing. Vegetation indices (VIs) (NDVI-normalized difference vegetation index, EVI-enhanced vegetation index, SRI-simple ratio index, SAVI-soil adjusted vegetation index, and NDRE-normalized difference red edge index) were also calculated from the spectral bands and their pixel value extracted. A correlation analysis was then performed between the spectral bands and VIs with the species diversity index. The results showed that spectral bands 6 (red) and 2 (blue) significantly correlated with the two main species diversity indices (S and H ') due to their influence on vegetation properties, such as canopy biomass and leaf chlorophyll content. Furthermore, we conducted a stepwise regression analysis to investigate the most important spectral bands to consider when estimating species diversity from the PlanetScope satellite data. Like the correlation results, bands 6 (red) and 2 (blue) were the most important bands to be considered for predicting species diversity. The model equations from the stepwise regression were used to predict tree species diversity. Overall, the study's findings emphasize the relevance of remotely sensed data in assessing the ecological condition of protected areas, a tool for decision-making in biodiversity conservation.

The results are as follows: (1) Overall carbon source metabolic capacities of soil microbial community weaken with increasing of infection grades of banana fusarium wilt. (2) Richness index, Simpson index, Shannon index and McIntosh index of soil microbial community gradually decreased with increasing of infection grades of banana fusarium wilt. (3) Principal component analysis show that metabolic characteristics of soil microbial community significantly change between the healthy plants and diseased plants in the same banana plot. The results would provide information for explaining the pathogenesis of banana fusarium wilt and controlling its incidence by applying microbial ecology to regulate soil environmental measures.					li, rui/JVM-8999-2024														1660-9336		978-3-03785-649-9				2013	295-298						2274	2280		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.295-298.2274	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.295-298.2274													WOS:000320828201110

C. difficile carriage and 16S rDNA profiling were studied in three clinical groups at three different sampling times: inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, C. difficile infection (CDI) patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). Diversity analysis was realized in the three clinical groups, the positive and negative C. difficile carriage groups and the three analysis periods. Concerning the three clinical groups, beta-diversity tests showed significant differences between them, especially between the HCW group and IBD group and between IBD patients and CDI patients. The Simpson index (evenness) showed a significant difference between two clinical groups (HCWs and IBD). Several genera were significantly different in the IBD patient group (Sutterella, Agathobacter) and in the CDI patient group (Enterococcus, Clostridioides). Concerning the positive and negative C. difficile carriage groups, beta-diversity tests showed significant differences. Shannon, Simpson and InvSimpson indexes showed significant differences between the two groups. Several genera had significantly different relative prevalences in the negative group (Agathobacter, Sutterella, Anaerostipes, Oscillospira) and the positive group (Enterococcus, Enterobacteriaceae_ge and Enterobacterales_ge). A microbiota footprint was detected in C. difficile-positive carriers. More experiments are needed to test this microbiota footprint to see its impact on C. difficile infection.					; Taminiau, Bernard/E-8008-2017	Daube, Georges/0000-0002-9282-8408; Crevecoeur, Sebastien/0000-0002-4500-0392; Martinez, Elisa/0000-0002-8879-0996; Taminiau, Bernard/0000-0001-6456-329X														2076-2607				OCT	2023	11	10							2527	10.3390/microorganisms11102527	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11102527								37894185					WOS:001099282500001

Vertical Distribution of Plant-Parasitic Nematodes in Sweet Potato	JOURNAL OF NEMATOLOGY												Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPN) are harmful pests that have become a severe threat to crop production worldwide. Diversity of PPN at horizontal and spatial scales influence the effectiveness of control strategies. This study evaluated the vertical distribution of PPN genera at 0 cm to 30 cm and 30 cm to 60 cm in sweet potato fields in Central, Manyatta, and Nembure regions of Embu County, Kenya. A significant region x depth interaction was observed for Tylenchus. For all the other nematode genera, there were no significant variations in the abundance at 0 cm to 30 cm and 30 cm to 60 cm depths. However, Helicotylenchus, Meloidogyne, and Scutellonema occurred in greater numbers at both depths in all regions. Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were higher at 0 cm to 30 cm depth while Pielou's evenness was similar at both depths in the three regions. Diversity partitioning of genus richness, Shannon, and Simpson diversities across all regions at 0 cm to 30 cm, indicated that beta component contributed 61.9%, 35.6%, and 22.6% of gamma diversity, respectively. Coinertia analysis indicated a significant covariation between nematode genera and soil properties. The results show that management of PPN in sweet potato fields should be targeted at soil depths that are not less than 60 cm.

Data was collected during field surveys in 2003 to 2010. Studied rivers represented watercourses with small and average watershed areas according to the Water Framework Directive, and sand was the dominant substrate of the river bottom. To evaluate the impact of shading on aquatic plants, biodiversity metrics such as number of taxa, Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson index, and evenness index were used. For statistical analyses, pairs of studied sites were compared and it was found that increased shading was limiting biodiversity, enhancing growth of bryophytes, and had minor influence on macrophyte indices describing ecological status. In the case of most of the diversity indices, high statistical significance was observed for pairs of sites with greater differences of shading between each other.

J	Li, YF; Ye, SM; Bai, WG; Zhang, GQ				Li, Yuanfa; Ye, Shaoming; Bai, Weiguo; Zhang, Gongqiao			Species diversity patterns differ by life stages in a pine-oak mixed forest	DENDROBIOLOGY												Natural forests comprise trees of different species and sizes, constituting a "biotic framework". Although examinations of diversity patterns at various spatial scales are frequently conducted, life stages are rarely accounted for. Pine-oak mixedwood forest is widely distributed around the world and constitutes main forest type in the Nanpan River Basin in southwest China. We established a fixed plot with an area of 100 m x 100 m in an undisturbed forest stand and classified trees according to five life stages based on their diameter at breast height (DBH) and height. Then, we calculated eight traditional diversity indices for each life stage. We found that species richness (R), abundance (N), and three diversity indices first increased and then decreased with increasing life stage. As sampling area increased, R, the Shannon-Wiener index (H') and Simpson's diversity index (D) first increased quickly, followed by a reduced rate of increase, whereas N showed a linear increase and three evenness indices showed gradual decreases. Global Moran's I values for each diversity index were small, indicating weak spatial autocorrelation. Both R and N of shrubs and saplings decreased sharply with life stage, with only large trees comprising the later life stages. Our results indicate that species diversity patterns in pine-oak forests, particularly in early successional stages, differ among life stages. The changes contribute to the understanding and conservation of forest biodiversity.

There was a significant correlation between the number of species and the micro-landform diversity, artificial habitat diversity, and logarithm of the area of the forest patch. When we performed a multiple regression analysis to identify the best-fit model so as to optimize the amount of variation in species diversity explained by using stepwise selection, three species diversity indices (species richness or Shannon's diversity index, logarithm of inverse Simpson index) had significant positive partial correlations with the logarithm of area of the forest patch, and negative correlations with the logarithm of isolation distance from mountain forest. Therefore, we conclude that pteridophyte species diversity depends on patch size and isolation distance from mountain forests. Comparison of the woody plant species-area curve with the pteridophyte species-area curve showed that the rate of increase of species number (inclination) with area was the same, but the Y-intercept of the pteridophyte species-area curve was lower than that of the woody plant curve. Therefore, the minimum conservation area required for ferns and fern. allies is greater than that for woody plant species. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To clarify the effects of point factors on species diversity and biomass, this study investigated the vegetation status of 41 sample plots in the grasslands of the Altay forest area. The Margalef richness index, Simpson dominance index, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, and Alatalo evenness index in the & alpha;-diversity measure were used to analyze the changing characteristics of species diversity and to explore the changing patterns of the spatial distribution of species diversity and above-ground biomass. The results show the following: (1) The above-ground biomass of grasslands in the Altay forest area shows a clear spatial pattern, with the above-ground biomass gradually decreasing from northeast to southwest; the altitude gradient shows a "single-peak" pattern of decrease followed by an increase, with the largest biomass at an altitude of 1400-1800 m. (2) There was a significant "bimodal" pattern of variation between above-ground biomass and grassland cover, which was significantly correlated with elevation (p < 0.05) but not with latitude and longitude. (3) Except for the Alatalo evenness index, the trend of the species diversity indexes showed a high trend in the northeast and a low trend in the southwest, with the highest overall species diversity index on average in the Qiaoati sample site. (4) Except for the Alatalo evenness index, all species diversity indexes were significantly correlated with latitude, altitude, longitude, and cover (p < 0.05); the species diversity indexes showed an upward spiral trend with altitude, and with increasing longitude and cover, the species diversity indexes showed an "S" pattern. Elevation, cover, latitude, and longitude were the main environmental factors affecting the spatial patterns of above-ground biomass and species diversity in the grasslands of Altay. The results of the study provide data support for grassland management and maintenance in the Altay forest area, as well as for grassland ecological security in the northwest arid zone of China.																				2073-445X				JUL	2023	12	7							1370	10.3390/land12071370	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/land12071370													WOS:001038530800001

Meal Regularity Plays a Role in Shaping the Saliva Microbiota	FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY												Background Diet may influence health directly or indirectly via the human microbiota, emphasizing the need to unravel these complex relationships for future health benefits. Associations between eating habits and gut microbiota have been shown, but less is known about the association between eating habits and saliva microbiota. Objective The aim of this study was to investigate if eating habits and meal patterns are associated with the saliva microbiota. Methods In total, 842 adolescents, aged 11-14 years, from the Finnish Health in Teens (Fin-HIT) study cohort were included in this study. Eating habits and breakfast and dinner patterns were derived from a web-based questionnaire answered in school. Three major eating habit groups were identified: fruit and vegetable avoiders (FV avoiders), healthy and unhealthy. Microbiota profiles were produced from 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4) sequencing of DNA from the saliva samples. Statistical models were adjusted for gender, age, parental language, body mass index (BMI) categories, and sequencing depth. Results Regular breakfast eaters had a higher alpha diversity (Shannon index with mean (standard error of means) 2.27 (0.03) vs. 2.22 (0.03), p = 0.06, inverse Simpson's index with 6.27 (0.17) vs. 5.80 (0.02), p = 0.01), and slight differences in bacterial composition (PERMANOVA: p = 0.001) compared with irregular breakfast eaters. A similar trend in alpha diversity was observed between regular and irregular dinner eaters (Shannon index with 2.27 (0.03) vs. 2.22 (0.03), p = 0.054, inverse Simpson's index with 6.23 (0.17) vs. 6.04 (0.22), p = 0.28), while no difference was found in composition (PERMANOVA: p = 0.08). No differences were identified between eating habit groups and saliva microbiota diversity (Shannon index p = 0.77, inverse Simpson's index p = 0.94) or composition (PERMANOVA: p = 0.13). FV avoiders, irregular breakfast eaters and irregular dinner eaters had high abundances of Prevotella. Conclusion Regularity of eating, especially breakfast eating, was associated with more diverse saliva microbiota and different composition compared with irregular eaters. However, the dissimilarities in composition were small between regular and irregular breakfast eaters. Our results suggest that Prevotella abundances in saliva were common in FV avoiders and meal skippers. However, the clinical implications of these findings need to be evaluated in future studies.

The catch data from single-day and multi-day trawlers for the period September 2013 to February 2014 were recorded. A total of 120 fish species belonging to 85 genera, 56 families and 23 orders were caught by 55 hauls of multi-day and single-day trawlers. Bathymetric distribution showed availability of maximum number of species at the depth of 15-19 m (70 species) followed by the depth of 20-24 m (65 species) and that of 10-14 m (64 species). Biodiversity in terms of number of species was found to be maximum during January 2014. The value of Shannon-Wienner index (H') was recorded between 1.42 and 1.63 indicating less diverse nature of fishes along Mumbai coast. Value of Margalef richness index (d) ranged between 7.08 and 8.79. The average value for Simpson index (lambda) recorded was 0.047. K-dominance plot clearly demonstrated the diversity pattern during the study period.																			0379-5136	0975-1033				SEP	2019	48	9					1435	1442																WOS:000498629800015

The structure of species diversity was investigated through the simultaneous analysis of indices relating to 4 diversity components: (1) the number of species (species density S and Margalef's D-mg index), (2) rarity (number of species with less than 5% of occurrence), (3) evenness (Heip's E-Heip and Berger-Parker's 1/d indices) and (4) taxonomic diversity (Delta, Delta*, Delta(+), Delta(+)). In addition, two popular heterogeneous indices (Simpson's 1 - D and Shannon's H' indices) combining the number of species and evenness were also considered. PCA based on Spearman's correlation coefficients was carried out to investigate empirical relationships between these 11 indices while genecalized linear models (GLMs) were used to analyse diversity patterns in relation to bathymetry. Our results showed that the 11 species diversity indices studied might be grouped into 6 complementary components: (1) number of species (species density S and Margalef's D-mg index), (2) evenness (E-Heip, 1/d, H', 1 - D, Delta), (3) rarity and each of the 3 other measures of taxonomy: (4) Delta*, (5) Delta(+), and (6) Lambda(+). This result showed not only that a single diversity index cannot provide a complete description of species diversity but also that - in some cases - it cannot even encapsulate a complete description of a specific diversity component. In addition, in contrast to their expected theoretical properties, some descriptors appeared to be redundant in our field study. Finally, we found that the influence ofdepth on diversity patterns is usually significant but weak and varies according to the diversity components considered. Our findings - which show that diversity descriptors may respond in different ways to habitat degradation or loss - highlight the complexity of defining priority areas of protection taking simultaneously into account the main characteristics of diversity.

In the cases that RCGAs use mutation operators whose rates decrease with the number of generations, having a metric of dissimilarity is very important. This metric may allow to evaluate the effectiveness of the crossover operator as the number of mutations at each iteration decreases, and it may provide a way to detect the convergence of the algorithm. The present work introduces a new method of detecting convergence of RCGAs that use decreasing mutation policies. This new procedure consists in the measuring of the diversity of the individuals of each generation by applying the modified Simpson's Diversity index, which is often used to quantify the biodiversity of a habitat in ecology.																					0-88986-479-9				2005							369	374																WOS:000233166400066
J	Broms, KM; Hooten, MB; Fitzpatrick, RM				Broms, Kristin M.; Hooten, Mevin B.; Fitzpatrick, Ryan M.			Accounting for imperfect detection in Hill numbers for biodiversity studies	METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Hill numbers unify biodiversity metrics by combining several into one expression. For example, species richness, Shannon's diversity index and the Gini-Simpson index are a few of the most used diversity measures, and they can be expressed as Hill numbers. Traditionally, Hill numbers have been calculated from relative abundance data, but the expression has been modified to use incidence data as well. We demonstrate an approach for estimating Hill numbers using an occupancy modelling framework that accounts for imperfect detection. We alter the Hill numbers formula to use occupancy probabilities as opposed to the incidence probabilities that have been used previously and to calculate its summations from the modelled species richness. After introducing the occupancy-based Hill numbers, we demonstrate the differences between them and the incidence-based Hill numbers previously used through a simulation study and two applications. In the simulation study and the two examples using real data, the occupancy-based Hill numbers were larger than the incidence-based Hill numbers, although species richness was estimated similarly using both methods. The occupancy-based Hill number estimators are always at their asymptotic values (i.e. as if an infinite number of samples have been taken for the study region), therefore making it easy to compare biodiversity between different assemblages. In addition, the Hill numbers are computed as derived quantities within a Bayesian hierarchical model, allowing for straightforward inference.

A total of 940 isolates obtained were grouped into 93 morphotypes, 43 species, and 23 genera, which were authenticated by molecular identification based on rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence analysis. A high diversity of endophytic fungi from Z. bungeanum are observed with high species richness S (43), Margalef index D (6.1351), Shannon-Wiener index H (3.2743), Simpson diversity index D-s (0.9476), PIE index (0.9486), and evenness Pielou index J (0.8705) but a low dominant index (0.0524). Significant tissue specificity of the endophytic fungi was observed in Z. bungeanum, and the highest species richness and diversity indexes were obtained in the stem. Phylogenetic analyses of the 93 endophytic isolates were carried out by the neighbor-joining (NJ) method to demonstrate their evolutionary processes. Antifungal activities of endophytic fungi were assayed and eight endophytic isolates showed strong and long-lasting inhibition against host pathogenic fungi Fusarium sambucinum and Pseudocercospora zanthoxyli. Here, for the first time, we systematically demonstrate the biodiversity, phylogeny, and antifungal activity of endophytic fungi associated with Z. bungeanum and reveal the value of sampling different tissues of a given plant to obtain the greatest endophyte species diversity, which might offer a framework for further investigation and utilization of endophytic fungi as aunique source of interesting and useful bioactive compounds.

With increase in China's demand and preference for shellfishes and value-added fish products, India sees China as the second largest export destination after the US. This study analyzed the status, export performance and competitiveness of Indian fish export to China based on data (2000-2018) from trademap.org and UNCOMTRADE statistical database. Compound Growth Rate (CGR) revealed that the seafood export grew at an annual rate of 9.68% in terms of value with instability of 0.24 from 2000-2018. The Simpson Index of Diversity (SID) to the China revealed that the index values remained highest all throughout the years as compared to USA and the rest of the world. The Unit Value Realization (UVR) was found highest in live fishes ($34.92/kg) followed by fresh chilled fish ($7.19/kg), crustaceans ($5.97/kg) and others for 2018.

Our results demonstrated the presence of Basidiomycetes. Sebacinales (81.61 %) and Cantharellales (12.10 %) were the dominant orders and are potential candidates for orchid mycorrhizal fungi. The Ascomycetes identified included the Helotiales (29.31 %), Capnodiales (18.10 %), and Sordariales (10.34 %), among others. These orders may represent potentially endophytic fungi. A Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') analysis showed a relatively high fungal community diversity associated with these tropical orchids. This diversity may offer greater flexibility in terms of the adaptation of the plants to changing environmental conditions and the potential facilitation of reintroduction programs. The Simpson diversity index values showed that all of the libraries included dominant species, and a LIBSHUFF analysis showed that the fungal communities were structurally different from each other, suggesting an influence of local factors on this diversity. This study offers important information for the development of conservation strategies for threatened and endemic species of Brazilian flora in an important and threatened hotspot.

Therefore, specific diversity changes in each site could be used as an indicator of the anthropic impact. In this study, the community of Calliphoridae in Hudson (Argentina) was sampled in three sites with different degrees of Synanthropy (natural, rural and urban). Flies were attracted with bait and collected with an insect net. Twelve samples were collected in each site and both Simpson and Shannon diversity indexes were calculated. The Natural area was the most diverse. The other two areas showed no significant differences between them. The diversity was higher in the middle of spring and in late summer, and lower at the end of spring and in the beginning of summer. Alterations due to human settlements affect diversity by decreasing the abundance of some species.

A total of nine STR markers were selected from available genomic A. fumigatus sequences and were divided into three multicolor multiplex PCRs. Each multiplex reaction amplified three di-, tri-, or tetranucleotide repeats, respectively. All nine STIR markers were used to analyze 100 presumably unrelated A. fumigatus isolates. For each marker, between 11 and 37 alleles were found in this population. One isolate proved to be a mixture of at least two different isolates. With the remaining 99 isolates, 96 different fingerprinting profiles were obtained. The Simpson's diversity index for the individual markers ranged from 0.77 to 0.97. The diversity index for the multiplex combination of di-, tri-, and tetranucleotide repeats ranged from 0.9784 to 0.9968. The combination of all nine markers yielded a Simpson's diversity index of 0.9994, indicative of the high discriminatory power of these new loci. In theory, this panel of markers is able to discriminate between no less than 27 x 10(9) different genotypes. The multicolor multiplex approach allows large numbers of markers to be tested in a short period of time. The exact nature of the assay combines high reproducibility with the easy exchange of results and makes it a very suitable tool for large-scale epidemiological studies.

The field research design employed a stratified random sampling method and was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 included the survey, identification and distribution of the pteridophyte flora and Phase 2 was to study the diversity of the extant pteridophytes throughout the KNP using seven transects. The region exhibited rich and highly diverse (Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index of 3.38), non-homogenous (compared to normal Raunkiaer's frequency curve) stand of 46 different unevenly (evenness index 0.64) distributed pteridophyte flora. The study region was dominated by two unambiguous pteridophyte species of weedy nature (Pteridium aquilinum and Dicranopteris linearis), with a high Simpson's dominance index of 0.96. The study reports eight endemic, two rare, five at risk and seven vulnerable and near-threatened IUCN listed pteridophyte species in the study region. The quantitative diversity indices i.e. frequency, density, abundance, relative abundance and important value index of each extant pteridophyte is calculated. The study also noted that some endemic species such as Osmunda huegeliana and Cyathea nilgirensis present in KNP needed immediate conservation efforts. This study gives an extensive report on the extant pteridophyte flora of KNP and will help future taxonomic surveys and research, as well as conservation and sustenance measures.					hegde, smitha/O-6364-2019; Morajkar, Shaiesh/ABF-3084-2020	hegde, smitha/0000-0001-5978-6835; Morajkar, Shaiesh/0000-0002-3993-0921													2348-1900						2021	8	4					848	+		10.14719/pst.2021.8.4.1057	http://dx.doi.org/10.14719/pst.2021.8.4.1057													WOS:000709686700015
J	Wang, H; Liu, C; Fan, H; Tian, X				Wang, Hui; Liu, Chao; Fan, Hong; Tian, Xu			Rising food accessibility contributed to the increasing dietary diversity in rural and urban China	ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CLINICAL NUTRITION												China has undergone a dramatic transition in food consumption in the past few decades. Diet composition has changed significantly because of an increase in food accessibility and lifestyle changes. To investigate dietary changes in China from the perspective of dietary diversity, we assessed the trend of dietary diversity in China by using the following 4 indicators: count index, dietary diversity score, entropy, and Simpson index. Data of 24,542 adults (age >= 18 y) were obtained from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) conducted in 2004, 2006, 2009, and 2011. Furthermore, the association between dietary diversity and the number of food facilities was investigated using multivariable regression and local polynomial regression. Results indicate that dietary diversity increased over time and was unequally distributed among regions and families. Urban residents had a significantly more diverse diet compared with their rural counterparts (p<0.01). Moreover, dietary diversity was positively associated with food accessibility (p<0.01), and it was affected by socioeconomic factors such as the family income, household size, gender, age, education, and region. Taken together, these data suggest that the increase in dietary diversity in China in the past decade can be partially attributed to the increase in food accessibility.						, xu/0000-0002-1070-3581													0964-7058	1440-6047					2017	26	4					738	747		10.6133/apjcn.052016.03	http://dx.doi.org/10.6133/apjcn.052016.03								28582828					WOS:000403381600025

MethodsBanana in Yunnan Province, China, was grown under three treatments: conventional tillage (bare soil), natural weed cover (primarily goosegrass (Eleusine indica (L.) Gaerth)), or a cover crop (Siratro (Macroptilium atropurpureum (DC.) Urb.)). Analysis of the soil fungal communities between 2017 and 2020 was done by Illumina Miseq high-throughput sequencing. ResultsMost significant effects were in the intercropping area for the treatments, whereas it was rarely observed in the furrow planted with banana. Based on the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, soil fungal diversity in the intercropping area significantly decreased following planting banana in 2017 with all three treatments. However, both the Shannon and Simpson diversity indices showed that there were significant increases in fungal soil diversity in 2019 and 2020 with natural weed cover or Siratro compared to bare soil. At the end of the experiment, significant increases in fungal genera with Siratro compared to bare soil were observed with Mortierella, Acremonium, Plectophaerella, Metarhizium and Acrocalymma, and significant decreases were observed with Fusicolla, Myrothecium, Exserohilum, Micropsalliota and Nigrospora. Siratro resulted in higher stability of the soil fungal microbiome by increasing the modularity and the proportion of negative co-occurrences compared to bare soil. For fungal guilds, Siratro significantly increased saprotrophs_symbiotrophs in 2019 and 2020 and significantly decreased pathogens_saprotrophs in 2020 compared to bare soil. DiscussionUsing Siratro as a cover crop in the intercropping area of banana helped maintain soil fungal diversity, which would be beneficial for soil health with more symbiotrophs and less pathogens in the soil. However, further research is needed to determine the long-term impact of weed or Siratro cover crop on the fungal soil ecosystem and growth of banana.

Due to the sensitivity of soil mites to soil disturbance, their diversity and numbers can be used as ecological indices for assessing disturbances in ecosystems. To determine the effect of land use type on soil mite biodiversity, abundance and biodiversity indices of soil inhabiting mesostigmatic mites were evaluated at eight sites in Saman and Shahrekord, Iran, each site including two adjacent agricultural pieces of land: an orchard and a crop field. The biodiversity of mites was measured by several biodiversity indices and then compared by analysis of variance. The specimens collected belonged to 12 families, 17 genera and 24 species. The biodiversity index values calculated in different months showed that these indices were usually higher in warm months and in orchards than in cold months and crop fields. In the examined crop fields, the diversity index values were lower after harvesting, probably due to soil disturbance by agricultural machinery. There was a significant difference in the Shannon-Wiener's diversity index among different land uses. The maximum and minimum values of this index were recorded at the vine orchard (1.48) and wheat field (0.15) in an elm/wheat site at Shahrekord, respectively. The soil organic matter content was maximum in the vineyard (2.12%) and minimum in the wheat field (0.41%).

MEASUREMENT OF DIVERSITY INDICES OF AVIAN COMMUNITIES AT TAUNSA BARRAGE WILDLIFE SANCTUARY, PAKISTAN	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES												The study was conducted to measure bird species diversity at Taunsa Barrage Wildlife Sanctuary from 2009 to 2011. The objective of the study was to identify avian diversity and main threats to them in the sanctuary. Data were collected by direct census method. In total, 58,598 bird species belonging to 53 families and 171 species were recorded. Density of the birds was 6.9 birds per hectare. Shannon-Weiner Diversity Index (H') was 3.39, whereas Simpson's Diversity Index (D) was 0.93. According to local occurrence status, there were 12 species ranked as very abundant, 19 abundant, 62 very common, 16 common and 41 fairly common. There were, however, 7 species, in each category, recorded as uncommon, rare and very rare. Seasonal occurrence observed for different bird species revealed; year-round residents 42%, summer breeders 7%, winter migrants 38% and passage migrants 13%. Five dominant species with their relative abundance included; Fulica atra (13.3), Bubulcus ibis (12.28), Egretta garzetta (11.46), Aythya ferina (8.9) and Corvus splendens (5.8). A decreasing population trend in 14 species was found by regression analysis. Main threats identified to survival of birds were; habitat degradation, pesticide usage and illegal hunting. The species richness and composition are important parameters for stability and functioning of an ecosystem, therefore, there is urgent need to protect avian diversity by protecting natural habitat of the area.

Culturable heterotrophic bacterial diversity study from an Indian lignite mine habitat	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Diversity lifts the productivity of any ecosystem as all the species have a vital role to play that is present within the ecosystem. The characterization is essential to delve into the ecological functions of microbial communities and discover the type of microorganisms present within the ecosystem. As microbial diversity in ecosystems responds to environmental disturbances, it functions as a marker to indicate the change in such ecosystems. Mine ecology differs significantly from other habitats due to the presence of acidic runoff. This paper provides insight into the diversity of cultivable bacteria isolated from lignite mines located in south Gujarat. A total of 67 heterotrophic isolates were successfully cultivated from the collected solid and water samples of the Rajpardi and Tadkeshwar Lignite mine sites. The isolates were characterized morphologically and biochemically, and intra- and extracellular enzyme synthesis were studied. Moreover, the relative density and frequency of cultivated isolates from the samples were calculated. The similarity and evenness of the heterotrophic isolated were studied by calculating diversity indices such as Shannon and Simpson. Alpha diversity was calculated in PAST software to analyse the similarity between the selected two mine sites. This research also explored the relationship between the variance in heterotrophic microbial diversity and substrate utilization richness of the studied lignite mines of Gujarat.

High temporal satellite remote sensing, recording difference in species phenology, can facilitate the extraction of timely, standardized and reliable information on tree diversity, complementing or replacing traditional field measurements. In this study, we used multispectral and multi-seasonal remotely sensed data from the Sentinel-2 satellite sensor along with geodiversity data for estimating local tree diversity in a Mediterranean forest area. One hundred plots were selected for in situ inventory of tree species and measurement of tree diversity using the Simpson's (D-1) and Shannon (H ') diversity indices. Four Sentinel-2 scenes and geodiversity variables, including elevation, aspect, moisture, and basement rock type, were exploited through a random forest regression algorithm for predicting the two diversity indices. The multi-seasonal models presented the highest accuracy for both indices with an R-2 up to 0.37. In regard to the single season, spectral-only models, mid-summer and mid-autumn model also demonstrated satisfactory accuracy (max R-2 = 0.28). On the other hand, the accuracy of the spectral-only early-spring and early-autumn models was significant lower (max R-2 = 0.16), although it was improved with the use of geodiversity information (max R-2 = 0.25).

Aims: Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the species diversity of Culex mosquito's larvae in the coastal areas of the Persian Gulf. Methods: Mosquito larvae were collected from six places in three main environmental categories: urban (UA), rural (RA) and uninhabited areas (UNA), using dipping technique. Four dips were taken from each breeding site (350 ml each). Larval investigation was conducted two times a month during the study period. Diversity studies were conducted separately for each category by calculating classic diversity indices. Results: In total, 1369 specimens belonging to 10 different species were collected and identified, as follows: Culex hortensis, Cx. laticinctus, Cx. mimeticus, Cx. perexiguus, Cx. pipiens, Cx. modestus, Cx. sinaiticus, Cx. theileri, Cx. torrentium and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus. None of these mosquito species have been recorded previously in this region. Diversity analysis indicated higher species richness for RA (Margalef 1/26). The average diversity indices for the three environment types ranged from 1.50 to 1.64 for Shannon index and from 0.730 to 0.738 for Simpson index. Conclusions: Biodiversity analysis indicated that species diversity in rural, urban and uninhabited areas is somewhat similar. Therefore, attention to all areas in vector control programs is essential.																			2327-8994						2019	6	2					99	106		10.3934/publichealth.2019.2.99	http://dx.doi.org/10.3934/publichealth.2019.2.99								31297396					WOS:000473793800001

We compared diversities of macrophyte communities in different river types and their relationship to water quality. The 240 surveyed rivers were situated in the central-west of Poland in a lowland area. Species compositional similarities were analysed using the Jaccard index. The macrophyte matrix was classified into four groups: Large rivers (LR), Sandy rivers (SaR), Stony rivers (StR) and Organic rivers (OR). The highest level of homogeneity was found for LR, followed by OR, StR and SaR. The greatest differences in species composition were found between LR and StR. Variabilities of indices (species richness, Shannon, Simpson and Pielou indices, and total cover) confirmed the specific diversity patterns in the four types of rivers. All metrics based on relative abundance were strongly correlated with each other, and they were never correlated with water quality. The total covers of LR and OR as well as species richness of LR show some correlation with water quality. The total cover was correlated with water quality in OR and LR. The communities with the highest species richness were related with OR.

Species and functional diversity of cool-season pastures are influenced by warm-season grazing management	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS												eCONTEXT: In southern Brazil, livestock producers often overseed cool-season annual grasses into warm-season perennial pastures to extend the grazing season and improve animal performance. However, the effects of warm-season pasture management on the subsequent cool-season pasture are poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate how grazing height and nitrogen (N) fertilization applied to a mixed-species pasture during the warm season affect forage accumulation and diversity in the cool-season pastures. METHODS: The experiment was conducted in a subtropical climate and consisted of two phases: warm season (November/December - April/May) and cool season (May - October/November). During the warm season, we applied a factorial combination of two pre-grazing heights (0.17 and 0.23 m) and three N rates (50, 150, and 250 kg N ha-1) to a mixed-species pasture. During the cool season, we managed all plots equally and measured forage accumulation and diversity using Simpson's and Rao's indices.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We found that warm-season N fertilization had no residual effect on cool-season pasture responses, but grazing at 0.17 m height during the warm season resulted in higher forage accumulation during the cool season than grazing at 0.23 m height (5100 vs. 4780 kg DM ha-1). However, grazing at 0.23 m height during the warm season increased species diversity (Simpson's index of 0.49 vs. 0.40) and functional diversity (Rao's index of 0.33 vs. 0.29) during the cool season compared to grazing at 0.17 m height. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides novel insights into the long-term effects of warm-season pasture manage-ment on cool-season pasture diversity and productivity in a subtropical climate. It shows that grazing at a height close to the critical leaf area index during the warm season can increase legume proportion and functional di-versity in the cool season, which can improve pasture resilience and sustainability. While this study offers valuable insights, it is important to acknowledge its restriction to a single location, and the need to assess the hypothesis raised here to other sites and conditions.

The diversities of chromosomal types, repC profiles, and combined genotypes were calculated using richness in types (adjusted to equal sample sizes by rarefaction), Shannon-Wiener index, and Simpson's index. The relative differences in diversity within each pair of sites were similar for all three diversity measures, Chromosomal types, repC profiles, and combined genotypes were each more diverse in arable soils than in grass soils at two of the four locations. The other comparisons showed no significant differences. We conclude that rhizobial diversity can be affected by differences between these two management regimens. Multiple regression analyses indicated that lower diversity was associated with high potential nitrogen and phosphate levels or with acidity.

However, many entomologists (both within Canada and worldwide) continue to publish studies without standardizing their data to take sampling effort into account. We present a case study to illustrate the importance of such standardization, using the collection of spiders (Araneae) by pitfall traps as model data. Data were analyzed using rarefaction to represent one example of a taxon sampling curve, and by a variety of traditional diversity indices to describe alpha diversity. Raw species richness and single-index diversity measures (Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's, and Fisher's alpha) provided contradictory results. Rarefied species richness standardized to the number of individuals collected enabled more accurate comparisons of diversity and revealed when sampling was insufficient. Focusing on arthropods occurring in forested ecosystems, we also examined the use of taxon sampling curves in current literature by reviewing 133 published articles from 14 journals. Only 26% of the published articles in our review used a taxon sampling curve, and raw species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index of diversity were the most commonly used estimates. There is clearly a need to modify how alpha diversity is measured and compared for arthropod biodiversity studies. We recommend the abandonment of both raw species richness and single-index measures of diversity, and reiterate the need to use rarefaction or a related technique that allows for meaningful comparisons of species richness while taking into account sampling effort.

J	Green, J				Green, J			Sampling method and time determines composition of spider collections	JOURNAL OF ARACHNOLOGY												Sampling methods and times can misrepresent components of spider assemblages found in tree crops. I collected 2561 spiders, including 20 families, 77 genera and 140 species, from inland and coastal south-east Queensland citrus orchards maintained under Integrated Pest Management programs. Spider assemblages, collected diurnally and nocturnally using vacuum and pit-trap sampling methods over four seasonal periods (spring, summer, autumn and winter), were compared using Simpson and Shannon-Wiener diversity indices and Morisita-Horn similarity index. Significantly different spider assemblages were collected by the two sampling methods in all orchards and seasons. Nocturnal and diurnal sample data differed for spider abundance (similarity) and diversity for several orchards. These results indicate the need to conduct nocturnal and diurnal sampling using a combination of sampling methods to reduce misinterpretation of the composition of spider assemblages. Such misinterpretations may underestimate the predatory importance of spiders in agricultural ecosystems.																			0161-8202						1999	27	1					176	182																WOS:000082213100026
J	Zhao, SJ; Ding, ZL				Zhao, Shujun; Ding, Zhongli			Changes in plant diversity on the Chinese Loess Plateau since the Last Glacial Maximum	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN												Changes in biodiversity during periods of global warming are of broad public concern. To study the effect of the warming process on the ecosystem, we carried out pollen analyses on samples from seven selected sections at Qingyang, Ningxian, Yangling, Binxian, Baoji, Yanshi, and Lingbao on the Chinese Loess Plateau in order systematically to evaluate changes in plant diversity since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). The plant richness indices (Simpson's diversity index and rarefaction analysis) indicated that the plant diversity of each section increased during the process of warming from the LGM to the Holocene Optimum, especially at Baoji and Lingbao. These results are consistent with many long-timescale geological records, which show that warming can increase biodiversity; therefore, the popular viewpoint that warming leads to biodiversity loss or species extinction needs to be re-examined.

FRESH WATER FISH SPECIES DIVERSITY AT CHASHMA BARRAGE, PAKISTAN	JOURNAL OF ANIMAL AND PLANT SCIENCES-JAPS												Pakistan managed extensive canal irrigation systems and has 19 Ramsar sites. Almost 27,977 fish species are present globally; there are 786 marine and 171 freshwater fishes in Pakistan. Fish diversity and distribution are closely related to various factors i.e. depth of water, availability of food, topography, breeding sites, and physicochemical features. Therefore, it is necessary to study the diversity of ichthyofauna in various regions and elevations. So, this study was planned to examine the fish diversity of Chashma Barrage to include more data related to fish diversity and distribution. Data were collected both by direct (physical count) and indirect methods (meeting with local people of Chashma Barrage) to find out fish diversity of Chashma Reservoir, Mianwali, from April 2016 to March 2017. In the current study, 1089 fish specimens of 21 species were documented from Chashma Barrage monthly. The Shannon-wiener Index (H') was recorded as 2.17, Simpson Index (S) was 0.16, Richness (R) was 20.67 and Evenness (E) was 0.712. It is concluded that study area has high diversity of fishes. Chashma Barrage is an important wetland for fishes, it should be declared as Ramsar site.

J	Zhang, Y; Chen, HYH; Taylor, A				Zhang, Yu; Chen, Han Y. H.; Taylor, Anthony			Multiple drivers of plant diversity in forest ecosystems	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												Aim Theoretical and empirical studies have shown that climate is a major determinant of species richness, yet the importance of climate relative to local site conditions remains unclear in forest ecosystems across large regions. Furthermore, little is known about how climate and local site conditions affect species evenness and understorey plant diversity. Location Canadian forest (42 degrees 37' to 68 degrees 14' N; 53 degrees 25' to 134 degrees 46' W; 4 to 2170 m elevation). Methods Using national, broad-scale forest inventory data, we tested the influence of growing degree days (GDD), climate moisture index (CMI), soil drainage class (SDC) and stand age (SA) on plant diversity across Canada's forests. Diversity was assessed on variable plot sizes from 125 to 500 m(2) for canopy tree and total plant species, and from 100 to 400 m(2) for understorey plants. Results Our models accounted for 47, 30 and 49% of total variation in canopy tree species richness, Simpson's dominance index and total plant species richness, respectively. After accounting for the effects of plot size and management history, canopy richness increased with GDD and CMI and peaked at intermediate SDC and SA. Simpson's dominance index decreased with increasing GDD and CMI and was lowest at intermediate SDC and SA. Total species richness was most strongly related to SDC and was highest on imperfectly drained soils. Climatic controls on species richness of understorey strata were generally weaker than those on canopy richness. Main conclusions Our results for canopy richness along a mainly longitudinal gradient demonstrate the positive effects of energy on tree species diversity and show evidence for the effects of local site conditions and secondary succession on diversity. Furthermore, our results show that the extent of the influence of climate and local site conditions on plant species diversity can strongly differ between vegetation strata.

Understanding the spatialization of that diversity is of importance to develop environmental public policies. The hypothesis of this study is that the tree species diversity from different forest types, in the state of Minas Gerais, presents distribution with spatial dependence. Thus, the objective of this work was to prove that spatial dependence and to relate it between the forest types. Data from the project called "Forest Inventory of Minas Gerais" were used to calculate indices of Shannon, Simpson and Pielou. We used geostatistical and kriging tools to create spatial maps. As results, the mappings indicated that the state presents well-defined gradients of diversity and richness of forest species, increasing in North-South and from West-East directions. The spatial dependence and the spatialization of the tree species diversity show that the geostatistical modeling is a tool that supports the forest resource management. The maps of diversity can be used as indicators of potential areas for creating Conservation Units, establishing ecological corridors, besides supporting environmental policy development.

J	Thabit, AK				Thabit, Abrar K.			Blinding of Peer Review and the Impact on Geographic Diversity of Authors in the Medical Literature	JOURNAL OF MULTIDISCIPLINARY HEALTHCARE												Background: Blinding of reviewers is hypothesized to improve the peer review process by removing potential bias. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of blinding of peer review on the geographic diversity of authors in medical/clinical journals.Methods: MEDLINE-indexed medical journals were evaluated, where journals that only publish in basic sciences or administration, non-English journals, journals that publish solely solicited materials, and journals that employ open review process were excluded. Journals were divided into single-blinded or double-blinded. Diversity was calculated by dividing the number of countries from which 20 evaluated articles come and multiplying by 100 (%diversity). The second method involved calculating Simpson's diversity index (SDI). Results: Of 1054 journals, 766 employ single-blinded review and 288 were double-blinded. Journals had a median age of 28 years and were mostly international (n=355 single-blinded and 97 double-blinded). No difference was observed between the two groups in median %diversity (45 in both groups; P=0.199) and SDI (0.84 vs 0.82; P=0.128). The indexing of journals in Science Citation Index Expanded (SCIE) collection of Web of Science and Scopus, and a higher CiteScore were significantly associated with higher % diversity and SDI (P<0.05).Conclusion: Although double blinding of peer review was not associated with higher geographic diversity of authors, several factors are also involved in the review process that could not be evaluated, such as blinding of editors. However, editors and publishers are encouraged to consider work from different countries to be able to index their journals in SCIE, Scopus, and MEDLINE where geographic diversity is a requirement.

Utility of the DNA barcoding gene fragment for parasitic wasp phylogeny (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonoidea): data release and new measure of taxonomic congruence	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES												The enormous cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) sequence database being assembled from the various DNA barcoding projects as well as from independent phylogenetic studies constitutes an almost unprecedented amount of data for molecular systematics, in addition to its role in species identification and discovery. As part of a study of the potential of this gene fragment to improve the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstructions, and in particular, exploring the effects of dense taxon sampling, we have assembled a data set for the hyperdiverse, cosmopolitan parasitic wasp superfamily Ichneumonoidea, including the release of 1793 unpublished sequences. Of approximately 84 currently recognized Ichneumonoidea subfamilies, 2500 genera and 41 000 described species, barcoding 5'-COI data were assembled for 4168 putative species-level terminals (many undescribed), representing 671 genera and all but ten of the currently recognized subfamilies. After the removal of identical and near-identical sequences, the 4174 initial sequences were reduced to 3278. We show that when subjected to phylogenetic analysis using both maximum likelihood and parsimony, there is a broad correlation between taxonomic congruence and number of included sequences. We additionally present a new measure of taxonomic congruence based upon the Simpson diversity index, the Simpson dominance index, which gives greater weight to morphologically recognized taxonomic groups (subfamilies) recovered with most representatives in one or a few contiguous groups or subclusters.

J	Collin, A; Archambault, P; Long, B				Collin, Antoine; Archambault, Phillippe; Long, Bernard			Predicting Species Diversity of Benthic Communities within Turbid Nearshore Using Full-Waveform Bathymetric LiDAR and Machine Learners	PLOS ONE												Epi-macrobenthic species richness, abundance and composition are linked with type, assemblage and structural complexity of seabed habitat within coastal ecosystems. However, the evaluation of these habitats is highly hindered by limitations related to both waterborne surveys (slow acquisition, shallow water and low reactivity) and water clarity (turbid for most coastal areas). Substratum type/diversity and bathymetric features were elucidated using a supervised method applied to airborne bathymetric LiDAR waveforms over Saint-Simeon-Bonaventure's nearshore area (Gulf of Saint-Lawrence, Quebec, Canada). High-resolution underwater photographs were taken at three hundred stations across an 8-km(2) study area. Seven models based upon state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as Naive Bayes, Regression Tree, Classification Tree, C 4.5, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and CN2 learners were tested for predicting eight epi-macrobenthic species diversity metrics as a function of the class number. The Random Forest outperformed other models with a three-discretized Simpson index applied to epi-macrobenthic communities, explaining 69% (Classification Accuracy) of its variability by mean bathymetry, time range and skewness derived from the LiDAR waveform. Corroborating marine ecological theory, areas with low Simpson epi-macrobenthic diversity responded to low water depths, high skewness and time range, whereas higher Simpson diversity relied upon deeper bottoms (correlated with stronger hydrodynamics) and low skewness and time range. The degree of species heterogeneity was therefore positively linked with the degree of the structural complexity of the benthic cover. This work underpins that fully exploited bathymetric LiDAR (not only bathymetrically derived by-products), coupled with proficient machine learner, is able to rapidly predict habitat characteristics at a spatial resolution relevant to epi-macrobenthos diversity, ranging from clear to turbid waters. This method might serve both to nurture marine ecological theory and to manage areas with high species heterogeneity where navigation is hazardous and water clarity opaque to passive optical sensors.

Kuntze (Brazilian pine)	BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												The biodiversity of filamentous fungi and their ecological relationships in the context of decaying Araucaria angustifolia (an endangered conifer) substrates are still mostly unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the diversity of saprotrophic filamentous fungi, based on morphological identification, associated with A. angustifolia, in addition to assessing possible saprobic/plant affinity relationship, and verifying whether the study areas and substrates affect the composition of the mycobiota. A total of 5000 substrates (decaying needles and twigs) were collected during five expeditions (2014/2015) to two areas: Sao Francisco de Paula National Forest (FLONA-SFP) and Sao Joaquim National Park (PARNA-SJ), Brazil. A total of 135 species distributed among 85 genera, 40 families, nine classes, 24 orders, three subphyla, and two phyla were identified. One new genus and five new species that were previously described, and six rare species and five species with affinity for A. angustifolia were also recorded. The twigs showed a community of fungi with greater richness and dominance. Conversely, the values of abundance, Simpson's diversity index, and evenness were lower than those determined for needles. In terms of the study areas, FLONA-SFP showed higher values of richness, abundance, Simpson's diversity index, and evenness than PARNA-SJ. Principal coordinate analysis and similarity percentage analysis showed the influence of both substrate factors and areas in the composition of the fungal communities. The presence of new, rare, and affinity-related species reinforces the study of fungi in the context of the conservation of this conifer, as these species are threatened by co-extinction.

Non-climatic factors also have important effects on vegetation altitudinal distribution in mountain regions. The purpose of this study was to explore the current distribution of plant diversity along the altitudinal gradient in the Taihang Mountain range of northern China and to estimate the effects of climatic and non-climatic factors on the elevational pattern. Through a field survey, a total of 480 sampling plots were established in the central Taihang Mountain range. Alpha diversities (the Shannon-Weiner index and Simpson index) and beta diversities (the Jaccard index and Cody index) were measured based on the survey data. Plant community structure change based on the altitudinal gradient was explored by measuring the diversity indices. Canonical correspondence analysis was carried out to determine the factors influencing plant altitudinal distribution. The contributions of climatic and non-climatic factors on plant distribution were determined by partial methods. The results showed that the plant diversity of the elevational gradient complied with a "hump-shaped " pattern, in which communities in the medium altitude area with higher plant diversity had a higher species turnover rate, and non-climatic factors, particularly the anthropogenic factors, had an important influence on the plant altitudinal pattern. In conclusion, climatic and non-climatic factors both had important effects on the plant altitudinal pattern. It is strongly recommended to reduce human interference in mountain vegetation protection and management.

J	Gogoi, A; Sahoo, UK				Gogoi, Anudip; Sahoo, Uttam Kumar			Impact of anthropogenic disturbance on species diversity and vegetation structure of a lowland tropical rainforest of eastern Himalaya, India	JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE												Impact of anthropogenic disturbance on species diversity and vegetation structure of a lowland tropical rainforest was studied in the foothills of Eastern Himalaya, India. Tree species richness, density, basal area and the diversity indices were found significantly (P<0.05) decreased with the increasing level of disturbances whereas, shrub density, basal area and herb density significantly increased with increasing disturbance level. In case of shrubs, Simpson's dominance index significantly (P<0.007) increased along the disturbance gradient, whereas Pielou's evenness index significantly (P<0.005) decreased with an increasing level of disturbance. Shannon-Weiner diversity index for herbs significantly (P<0.016) increased with increasing disturbance whereas, Simpson's dominance index was significantly (P<0.013) declined along the disturbance gradient. Results revealed that 10-50 cm dbh classes constituted the highest stem density, and highest basal area was recorded in the >100 cm dbh class in all three sites. Density of the matured trees decreased with increasing DBH whereas, tree basal area tended to increase with increasing DBH in all three sites. Tree species richness was highest in the lower DBH classes. 62.07% of the total tree species regenerated in the largely undisturbed site followed by 50% in the mildly disturbed and 26.32% in the highly disturbed site. The overall regeneration condition was found to be good in the largely undisturbed site. Mildly disturbed site exhibited fair regeneration and so was in the highly disturbed site. Discernable variations in species composition, diversity, regeneration and tree population structure revealed the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on rainforest vegetation dynamics. Higher degree of disturbance was furtherly found not only affecting species diversity but also promoting the growth of invasive weed species. Dominance of Hydnocarpus kurzii and Crypteronia paniculata in the highly disturbed site also indicated that these less-valued timber species may benefit from the vegetation mosaic produced by the disturbance; so differences in abundance of these species may be useful for bio-indication. Furthermore, present study suggests the need of adequate biodiversity conservation measures and adaptation of sustainable forest management approaches in disturbed areas of lowland tropical rainforest in the foothills of eastern Himalaya, India.

Lam. from Algeria	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												In this study, the diversity of endophytic and epiphytic fungi communities was evaluated and compared from healthy, symptomless and green leaves of the medicinal plant Ziziphus lotus (wild jujube) growing in Northern Algeria. Culture-based methods were used to isolate the endophytes and epiphytes. Morphological and molecular analyses were applied for identification of the fungi taxa. Both communities of the phylloplane of Ziziphus lotus differed in size and composition. Out of all 52 species, 19 were identified as epiphytic fungi and 45 as endophytes with 12 species shared by the two communities (Aspergillus costaricaensis, A. tubingensis, Aureobasidium sp., Cladosporium asperlatum, C. halotolerans, C. limoniforme, Penicillium chrysogenum, P. desertorum, P. flavigenum, P. momoii, Stemphylium sp. and Trichothecium crotonigenum). The two communities were found to be moderately similar (Sorensen similarity index = 0.37). Higher diversity values were found in endophytic community compared to epiphytic community: Shannon's diversity index H' (3.29 vs 1.83), Simpson diversity index C' (0.94 vs 0.74), species richness (3.06 vs 0.46) and species evenness (0.86 vs 0.62). Additionally, the correlation matrix was generated for the identification of possible interactions between different fungi.																			1505-2249					DEC	2022	70	4					159	174		10.3161/15052249PJE2022.70.4.003	http://dx.doi.org/10.3161/15052249PJE2022.70.4.003													WOS:001029066000003

Microalgal diversity of a tropical estuary in south India with special reference to isolation of potential species for aquaculture	JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION												The present study unravels the microalgal diversity and dynamics of a tropical estuarine ecosystem (Muttukadu, of Indian south east coast) and applies tools like isolation of useful species to utilize in aquaculture as well as to conserve the native strains. The study was carried out for a period of 18months. Selected diversity indices (Simpson index, Dominance index, Shannon- Weiner index, Pielou's evenness index and Margalef richness index) were used to describe the trends of diversity in the estuary during the study period. Spatial and temporal changes in microalgal diversity in the estuary were analysed. Sixty three species of microalgae belonging to Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Dinophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Eustigmatophyceae, Prymnesiophyceae, Prasinophyceae and Zygnematophyceae were identified. Out of these, members of Bacillariophyceae formed the dominant flora (48.5%) with twenty six species, followed by Cyanophyceae (29.2%) and Chlorophyceae (13.6%). The species diversity was increased after the flood during December-2015 in south east coast of India. More than two dozens of microalgal strains useful for larval nutrition in aquaculture were isolated during the study period. Nutrient profiling of isolates revealed the presence of essential fatty acids (EPA & DHA) in high percentage in some of the isolates. Altogether, the present study is the first report of this kind from Muttukadu which gives the insight on a) the seasonal changes in abundance of microalgae species in a tropical estuary and b) suitable time for the isolation of potential species for aquaculture and conservation of various species in the laboratory conditions.

Portfolio diversity was computed using the Simpson and Shannon Indexes, and a double-robust inverse -probability-weighted regression adjustment estimator was used to analyze the 2017 China Household Finance Survey data. Findings showed that internet use was associated with higher value and diversity of risky financial asset portfolios. The associations were stronger for females than males. Specifically, internet use was associated with an increase of 57% in portfolio values of females compared to 18% of males; it was associated with increases of 310-313% and 97-99% in the portfolio diversity of females and males, re-spectively.(c) 2023 Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

J	Butturi-Gomes, D; Petrere, M; Giacomini, HC; Zocchi, SS				Butturi-Gomes, Davi; Petrere, Miguel, Jr.; Giacomini, Henrique C.; Zocchi, Silvio Sandoval			Statistical performance of a multicomparison method for generalized species diversity indices under realistic empirical scenarios	ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS												The Pallmann-Scherer test is a promising multicomparison procedure to test statistical hypotheses regarding generalized diversity/entropy indices, such as Tsallis family and Hill numbers (S-q and H-q, respectively), which represent alternative ways of profiling species diversity along a gradient of emphasis on species richness versus evenness in abundance distributions. Given the pressing importance of reliably comparing diversity across ecological communities, and since only a few of such procedures are currently available, knowing its statistical performance under realistic ecological scenarios is of strategic importance. In this paper, we evaluated the performance of the Pallmann-Scherer test using computer simulations of communities following different species-abundance distributions, spatially aggregated as widely observed empirically, and sampled by a commonly used quadrat procedure. We found that the test is very conservative for both Sq and Hq, leading to biased significance levels, with low probabilities of type-I error but high probabilities of type-II error (i.e., low statistical power). Although it should be acknowledged that the current method represents an important starting point, further improvements must be made in order to enhance its power and meet the required standards in comparative studies of diversity.

Its agroecosystem has phytophagous and entomophagous insects. Diversity in the Comarca Lagunera was studied in 2020 and 2021. Thirty-eight species of predators and parasitoids were found, with most common being Bariscapus sp., Orius leavigatus, Tetrastichus sp., Hippodamia convergens, Chrysoperla sp., and Collops vittatus. This complex of entomophagous insects is important for natural biological control of pest insects. Twenty-six species of phytophagous insects were also found, the most common being Chaetocnema ectypa, Diabrotica balteata, Rhopalosiphum maidis, and Dalbulus maidis. This complex of phytophagous insects may be important as a limiting factor of maize productivity or be potential pests. Based on values of the diversity indices of Margalef, Simpson and Shannon-Wiener, diversity of entomophagous insects was more at the beginning of the crop-growing season, while diversity of phytophagous insects was greater mid to late; diversity of entomofauna in maize was intermediate.																			0147-1724	2162-2647				MAR	2023	48	1					203	212																WOS:000980738700020

SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												Invasive alien plants (IAPs) can negatively affect plant taxonomic diversity, community stability, and invasibility in the invaded habitats. This study aimed to assess the degree of influence of the lAP Solidago canadensis L under various levels of invasion (i.e., light, moderate, and heavy invasion based on its relative abundance in the invaded communities) on plant taxonomic diversity, community stability, and invasibility. In addition, we determined the contribution of plant taxonomic diversity to community stability and invasibility under various levels of S. canadensis invasion. The degree of influence of S. canadensis on plant taxonomic diversity and community stability increases as the level of S. canadensis invasion increases. Community invasibility increases as the level of S. canadensis invasion increases. The competitive advantage of S. canadensis is negatively associated with all indexes of plant taxonomic diversity and community stability but positively connected with community invasibility. Community stability is positively related to Shannon's diversity and Simpson's dominance indexes but negatively associated with community invasibility. Inversely, communities were more likely to be invaded when they had less plant taxonomic diversity. Thus, plant communities with lower values of plant taxonomic diversity and community stability are more vulnerable to S canadensis invasion. Plant diversity causes a greater pressure on community stability than the other indexes of plant taxonomic diversity under various levels of S. canadensis invasion. However, the contribution intensity of the number of plant species to community invasibility is higher than the other indexes of plant taxonomic diversity under various levels of S. canadensis invasion.

A unified index to measure ecological diversity and species rarity	ECOGRAPHY												Several indices have been created to measure diversity, and the most frequently used are the Shannon-Wiener (H) and Simpson (D) indices along with the number of species (S) and evenness (E). Controversies about which index should be used are common in literature. However, a generalized entropy (Tsallis entropy) has the potential to solve part of these problems. Here we explore a family of diversity indices (S-q; where q is the Tsallis index) and evenness (E-q), based on Tsallis entropy that incorporates the most used indices. It approaches S when q=0, H when q -> 1 and gives D when q=2. In general, varying the value of the Tsallis index (q), S-q varies from emphasis on species richness (q < 1) to emphasis on dominance (q > 1). Similarly, E-q also works as a tool to investigate diversity. In particular, for a given community, its minimum value represents the maximum deviation from homogeneity (E-q=1) for a particular q (herein named q*). It is remarkable that our analysis indicates that q* and its corresponding evenness, E-q*, are negatively affected by S when using simulated data. They may represent an index related to species rarity. Furthermore, S-q* (i.e. the value of S-q for a specific q*) is positively affected by richness that is an important property of any diversity index. In general, our findings indicate that the indices H, D, S, S-q*, E and E-q* are only part of a whole set of possibilities. In addition, the ecological properties of E-q* and S-q*, proposed here for the first time, show promise in ecology.

For all 3years, the population dynamics and biodiversity of NTAs were analyzed to determine if any differences might be attributable to the genetically modified (GM) maize being evaluated. The main NTAs in these fields were Aphidoidea, Pentatomidae,Araneae, and Coccinellidae. Temporal variation in NTA diversity across sample dates within a year showed no significant differences between the Bt maize and the non-Bt maize field in the total number of individuals of the dominant arthropod species per 25 plants, the Shannon index (H), Pielou index (J), Simpson index (D), and Bray-Curtis index. The cultivation of Bt corn failed to show any detrimental evidence on individuals, H, J, D, and Bray-Curtis index of NTAs, and these parameters were identical in Bt and non-Bt corn plots. These results provide further evidence of the lack of ecological impact of GM maize.

Response of soil invertebrates to disturbance across three resource regions in North Carolina	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												We evaluated the potential of soil microarthropods and enchytraeid worms to be useful as bioindicators of soil condition in forest, wetland, and agricultural ecosystems over a range of ecoregions. Selected mesofauna and soil characteristics in soil and litter in relatively undisturbed and disturbed examples of each of three ecosystems within each of three land resource regions were monitored over two years. Optimal times of year to sample these organisms as indicators of disturbance were April, May, July and September. No single measure reflected disturbance across all three ecosystems. Among forest sites, Simpson's diversity index, evenness, abundance of ants, and proportion of enchytraeids in the mesofauna differed between soils of different disturbance levels. Among agricultural sites, richness, evenness, abundance of mites, and proportions of collembolans and of enchytraeids in the mesofauna differed between disturbance levels. Among wetland sites, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices, richness based on the total mesofauna, and abundances of mites, diplurans, ants, and isotomid and onychiurid collembolans differed between disturbance levels. Covariates most frequently associated with abundance and diversity of the measured mesofauna were soil electrical conductivity, available N, organic matter, and pH. Canonical correspondence analysis provided information somewhat different to bivariate analysis. Using both approaches to examine soil and litter taxa that have distinctive responses to disturbance may help to identify candidate groups applicable for use in large-scale environmental monitoring programs.

Monitoring the emergence and transmission of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains permits the elucidation of the source of infection and routes of bacterial transmission. The aim of the present study was an in silico comparison of Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis with different schemes of Multiple Locus Variable-number Tandem Repeat Analysis in terms of discriminatory power and concordance. Materials and methods: 58 P.aeruginosa whole genomes have been analyzed in silico to determine SpeI-digested PFGE type and subspecies types using different MLVA methods. Resolution power, strength and direction of the concordance between typing methods have been estimated by calculation of the Simpson's index, the adjusted Rand and the adjusted Wallace coefficients. Results: The Simpson's indices of diversity were 1.0 for PFGE and from 0.995 to 0.999 for MLVA schemes with 6-19 markers. The congruence between PFGE and different MLVA methods measured by the adjusted Rand index were from 0.306 to 0.665 on cluster level for PFGE and type level for MLVA. The congruence was slightly higher at the clonal cluster level-from 0.46 to 0.694. Conclusion: Our in silico study for comparing different MLVA schemes with PFGE, based on Pseudomonas aeruginosa genomes showed, on the one hand, the same high level of discriminatory power of PFGE and MLVA even with 6 tandems markers; nonetheless, on the other hand, there was moderate/poor congruence (no more 70%) between PFGE and MLVA schemes on cluster level.

Based on 54 samples from a uniform riffle of a California mountain stream, coefficients of variation ranged from 7% for Simpson's diversity index to greater than 100% for several measures. Richness measures, Margalef's diversity index, the Family Biotic Index, and the ratio of individuals of the scraper functional-feeding group to total number of individuals were accurate in detecting acid and thermal stress (i.e., statistically significant differences were found) but did not indicate impact when no impact occurred. Functional measures (e.g., ratios of functional groups) require greater taxonomic effort than structural measures. Separation of natural variability from perturbation-induced variability is essential in the impact assessment process.																			0373-4137						1994	61	4					375	383		10.1080/11250009409355910	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/11250009409355910													WOS:A1994QC42600014

Researchers are increasingly exploring the possibility that degraded landscapes such as mixed-used agricultural areas and rainforest fragments might be used to supplement conservation strategies aimed at increasing arthropod biodiversity. Here we present the results of a comparative biodiversity field study in the Puriscal region on the Pacific slope of Costa Rica in a rural community characterized by a mixture of secondary forest and farmland. The study compares beetle and spider diversity among farmland, nearby tropical forest fragments, and weedy "edge" habitats. Diversity of families of Coleoptera and Araneae pitfall catches were compared in each of these three habitats, and quantitative similarity indices across habitats were calculated for the collected specimens. Diversity among the three habitats was similar for beetles, but spiders were more diverse in forest fragments than in edge habitats. Furthermore, composition of beetle families was markedly different across all three habitats; spider families were similar only between forest fragment and edge habitats. We discuss the implications of these findings, and suggest further studies needed to address mechanisms underlying these patterns.

The Tsallis generalized entropy enhances the interpretation of transcriptomics datasets	PLOS ONE												BackgroundIdentifying differentially expressed genes between experimental conditions is still the gold-standard approach to interpret transcriptomic profiles. Alternative approaches based on diversity measures have been proposed to complement the interpretation of such datasets but are only used marginally. MethodsHere, we reinvestigated diversity measures, which are commonly used in ecology, to characterize mice pregnancy microenvironments based on a public transcriptome dataset. Mainly, we evaluated the Tsallis entropy function to explore the potential of a collection of diversity measures for capturing relevant molecular event information. ResultsWe demonstrate that the Tsallis entropy function provides additional information compared to the traditional diversity indices, such as the Shannon and Simpson indices. Depending on the relative importance given to the most abundant transcripts based on the Tsallis entropy function parameter, our approach allows appreciating the impact of biological stimulus on the inter-individual variability of groups of samples. Moreover, we propose a strategy for reducing the complexity of transcriptome datasets using a maximation of the beta diversity. ConclusionsWe highlight that a diversity-based analysis is suitable for capturing complex molecular events occurring during physiological events. Therefore, we recommend their use through the Tsallis entropy function to analyze transcriptomics data in addition to differential expression analyses.

The bacterial communities in plant phloem-sap-feeding insects	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY												The resident microbiota of animals represents an important contribution to the global microbial diversity, but it is poorly known in many animals. This study investigated the bacterial diversity in plant phloem-sap-feeding whiteflies, aphids and psyllids by pyrosequencing bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons. After correction for sequencing error, just 3-7 bacterial operational taxonomic units were recovered from each insect sample sequenced to sufficient depth for saturation of rarefaction curves. Most samples were dominated by primary and secondary symbionts, which are localized to insect cells or the body cavity, indicative of a dearth of bacterial colonists of the gut lumen. Diversity indices of the bacterial communities (Shannon's index: 0.40-1.46, Simpson's index: 0.15-0.74) did not differ significantly between laboratory and field samples of the phloem-feeding insects, but were significantly lower than in drosophilid flies quantified by the same methods. Both the low bacterial content of the phloem sap diet and biological processes in the insect may contribute to the apparently low bacterial diversity in these phloem-feeding insects.

J	Yaseen, R; Yossif, T				Yaseen, Rabaa; Yossif, Taher			Functional Microbial Diversity in Relation to Soil Characteristics and Land Uses of Wadi Um Ashtan Basin, North-western Coast, Egypt	EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE												THE OBJECTIVE of this study was to survey the soil and assess the functional microbial diversity in relation to soil physicochemical characteristics and land uses of a representative watershed basin in the NW coastal region of Egypt. The area is classified, on basis of remote sensing as well as GIS facilities, into four (4) major landforms i.e. coastal plain, wadi course, piedmont plain, and plateau table land. Twenty (20) soil profiles, representing those landforms, were morphologically described, their physical and chemical characteristics and land uses were determined; and their diagnostic characteristics were assessed. Results indicated that soils generally belong to the order Entisols and could be placed, at sub-group level, to Typic Torrifluvents, Typic Torriorthents, and Lithic Torrorthents. Also, Topsoil samples were collected from the mentioned twenty sites and evenly distributed over the entire watershed. They were analyzed for physical and chemical characteristics and the colony forming units (cfu) of nitrogen fixers, phosphate solublizers, cellulose, protein and starch decomposers were estimated. Soil enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, nitrogenase, urease, protease, cellulase, amylase and phosphatase) were determined and Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices were used. The results based on statistical analysis showed significant correlation between "the studied soil characteristics and land uses" and "soil microbial groups and enzyme activities" of the study area. The findings of Shannon and Simpson indices of the studied microbial groups and enzyme activities indicated that the coastal plain soils have moderate functional diversity, soils of wadi course and piedmont plain have the largest functional diversity, and the lowest diversity indices were recorded in soils of the plateau table land. Correlation analysis showed that land uses was positively correlated with urease activity and negatively correlated with nitrogenase activity. In addition, microbial activities and population were negatively affected by gravel, calcium carbonate, hydrogen ion and salinity and positively affected by organic matter. The study outputs could support sustainable land management and participatory agricultural development process for rainfed agriculture in Egypt.																			0302-6701	2357-0369				SUM	2019	59	3					285	303		10.21608/ejss.2019.14096.1282	http://dx.doi.org/10.21608/ejss.2019.14096.1282													WOS:000501548700007

Species richness in the tree layer and understory had no significant difference among disturbance gradients, but Simpson index, Shannon-Weiner index and Evenness index varied significantly.species diversity index decreased with disturbance gradient. Multi-Response Permutation Procedures (MRPP) revealed high significance in species composition of both tree and understory layer among different disturbance gradients. Twelve species from the tree layer and 25 from the understory were detected to characterize the forest communities with a certain disturbance regime by Indicator Species Analysis (ISA). Indicator species help enhance our understanding of species-environment relationship, and the ecological response of indicator species to disturbance can be used for monitoring forest environmental change.					qi, li/JFE-7167-2023; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023														1660-9336		978-3-03785-469-3				2012	195-196						1275	+		10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.195-196.1275	http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/AMM.195-196.1275													WOS:000312421800226

At the regional scale, macroinvertebrate communities of perennial and intermittent springs displayed significant differences in the number of taxa, macroinvertebrate community abundance, diversity indices (Shannon and Simpson indices) and the Berger-Parker dominance index at intermediate discharge. However, no significant difference was recorded between intermittent and perennial sites at high discharge or when all sampling occasions were pooled. At the catchment scale, the number of taxa, community abundance and Bray-Curtis similarity coefficients within the River Lathkill differed significantly between intermittent springs and other habitats. At both the regional and catchment scale the macroinvertebrate communities of intermittent springs were characterised by a small number of taxa displaying life cycle adaptations to intermittent aquatic habitats, particularly Trichoptera.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted during 2016 in North Khorasan Province. The sampling was focused on rural regions, where human cases of VL and/or CL were diagnosed and reported during last 5 years. Sand flies were collected three times each twenty days during peak periods of seasonal activity. Seven collection methods were used. Some Alpha and Beta diversity indices were calculated. Results: Overall, 7253 sand flies were collected and identified. They were from 19 species of Phlebotominae sandflies. Phlebotomus sergenti and Ph. papatasi were the most prevalent (84.9%) species in the study area. Species richness (S) was very different in three areas and were 18, 8, and 4 respectively but Evenness (E) were 0.357, 0.345, and 0.380, so evenness was almost equal in the study areas. Shannon Index (H') and Margalef Richness Index were calculated 1.033, 0.718, 0.527 and 2.117, 0.8998, 0.4006 respectively. Conclusion: The sand fly fauna in North Khorasan Province was very rich and often included some of the most important proven or suspected vectors of leishmaniasis. Species diversity indices (Shannon index, and Simpson's index) were not high due to decreasing in evenness. The Margalef richness index could accurately reflect the biodiversity of sand flies between three subtidal locations.

Entropy decomposition, i.e. decomposing gamma entropy into alpha and beta components, has been previously derived in the literature. We propose a generalization of the additive decomposition of Shannon entropy applied to Tsallis entropy. We obtain a self-contained definition of beta entropy as the information gain brought by the knowledge of each community composition. We propose a correction of the estimation bias allowing to estimate alpha, beta and gamma entropy from the data and eventually convert them into true diversity. We advocate additive decomposition in complement of multiplicative partitioning to allow robust estimation of biodiversity.

J	Kunakh, OM; Volkova, AM; Tutova, GF; Zhukov, OV				Kunakh, O. M.; Volkova, A. M.; Tutova, G. F.; Zhukov, O., V			Diversity of diversity indices: Which diversity measure is better?	BIOSYSTEMS DIVERSITY												The article evaluates the dependence of the most common indices of species diversity on sample size and determines their ability to differentiate between different types of ecosystems, with a special emphasis on discriminating between natural and anthropogenic ecosystems. An approach to adjusting the indices to reduce their dependence on sample size was also proposed. The study was conducted in seven types of ecosystems: four were natural and three were anthropogenically transformed. Samples of soil animals were selected in 2011-2013 and 2021 using the same methods. A total of 20,518 soil animal specimens belonging to 202 species were collected in all study locations. The null alternative was generated by randomly selecting samples containing 2, 3, ..., 110 soil animals from the combined soil animal sample. For each gradation of sample size, 200 sample variants were formed. The density of soil macrofauna in natural ecosystems ranged from 3.6 & PLUSMN; 1.5 to 15.2 & PLUSMN; 6.9 specimens per sample, and in artificial ecosystems - from 13.2 & PLUSMN; 7.6 to 21.0 & PLUSMN; 11.9 specimens per sample. The number of species ranged from 22-80 species, and in artificial ecosystems it was 38- 99 species. Indicators of species diversity correlated with each other. A high level of correlation was observed between indicators within groups of indices: indices of species richness and indices of heterogeneity and evenness. Fisher's log-series alpha and the fundamental parameter of biodiversity were highly correlated with each other, as well as with the Margalef, species richness, and Chao's species abundance indices. The log-normal distribution best describes the dominance patterns in terms of abundance in the natural ecosystems, and the Zipf-Mandelbrot distribution best describes the dominance patterns in terms of abundance in the artificial ecosystems. Diversity indices were ordered in the space of two dimensions, one explaining the variation between ecosystems and the other depending on sample size. The ordering of the traditional indices showed that there is a vacancy for the best index in the sense that such an index should best explain differences between ecosystems and differences between natural and artificial ecosystems. It should also be independent of sample size. The Simpson heterogeneity index and the Simpson evenness index were the best of the traditional indices, but they did not explain differences between ecosystems very well, especially when it came to distinguishing between natural and artificial ecosystems. The Margalef index, which is supposed to be independent of sample size, on the other hand, showed a very high level of dependence. Such a dependence was also found for the Menhinick index, though to a lesser extent. Obviously, size dependence negatively affects the differential ability of the indices. The corrected indices of species richness and the Shannon index are practically independent of sample size and have a greater ability to differentiate ecosystems by the level of diversity, with natural ecosystems characterized by consistently higher values of the corrected indices than artificial ecosystems. The dependence on the sample size makes indices from different ecosystems practically incomparable, which makes their use meaningless. Even minor differences in sample size can lead to significant deviations in the values of diversity indices. The application of the Michaelis-Menten model allowed us to suggest a method of correction of species richness indices and the Shannon index. After the correction, the indices are practically independent of the sample size, and their differential ability to characterize individual ecosystems and the level of anthropogenic transformation increases significantly.

Whereas field inventories and optical images are generally used to estimate forest diversity, studies that combine vertical structure information and multi-temporal phenological characteristics to accurately quantify diversity in large, heterogeneous forest areas are still lacking. In this study, combined with regression models, three different diversity indices, namely Simpson (lambda), Shannon (H '), and Pielou (J '), were applied to characterize forest tree species diversity by using GEDI LiDAR data and Sentinel-2 imagery in temperate natural forest, northeast China. We used Mean Decrease Gini (MDG) and Boosted Regression Tree (BRT) to assess the importance of certain variables including monthly spectral bands, vegetation indices, foliage height diversity (FHD), and plant area index (PAI) of growing season and non-growing seasons (68 variables in total). We produced 12 forest diversity maps on three different diversity indices using four regression algorithms: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Lasso Regression (LR). Our study concluded that the most important variables are FHD, NDVI, NDWI, EVI, short-wave infrared (SWIR) and red-edge (RE) bands, especially in the growing season (May and June). In terms of algorithms, the estimation accuracies of the RF (averaged R-2 = 0.79) and SVM (averaged R-2 = 0.76) models outperformed the other models (R-2 of KNN and LR are 0.68 and 0.57, respectively). The study demonstrates the accuracy of GEDI LiDAR data and multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images in estimating forest diversity over large areas, advancing the capacity to monitor and manage forest ecosystems.

All 78 erythromycin-resistant S. pneumoniae isolates collected from blood cultures in our hospital (2000-07) were studied and the population structure was analysed by using different mathematical diversity indexes. Erythromycin resistance determinants were screened by PCR. The population structure, including multilocus sequence typing, was analysed by using quantitative clonal diversity (diversity ratio, Simpson, Selander-Levin and Shannon mathematical indexes). The leading resistance gene was erm(B) (74.3% of the isolates), followed by the erm(B) plus mef(A) combination (17.9%) and mef(A) alone (7.7%). The most frequent serotypes were 14 (18%), 19A (15.4%) and 6B (11.5%). A polyclonal structure was detected in resistant strains, including the Spain(9V)-3, Spain(6B)-2 and Denmark(14)-32 international clones. Both genetic diversity and genetic distribution were high, particularly among clones containing erm(B) and erm(B) plus mef(A) determinants. The resistance determinants erm(B) and the combination of erm(B) plus mef(A) were observed within multiple S. pneumoniae bacteraemic clones. The preservation of a polyclonal structure might provide a suitable background for further evolution of antibiotic resistance.

Through an innovative ecological analogy, the diversity of ships in every port has been calculated using Simpson, Shannon, Margalef, and Berger-Parker diversity indexes and Automatic Identification System data from the cruise fleet in year 2015. By combining the results of Visiting Vessels Diversity with an Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering analysis, five different homogeneous cruise regions were identified that match with those normally established by cruise ship associations. Classification trees techniques also demonstrated that cruise ships' diversity in a port could significantly predict these cruise regions with high levels of confidence. All of this information together can serve as an input to develop and improve economic and environmental strategies of cruise ports and their cities. The primary goal of this paper is to obtain a picture of the behaviour of cruise traffic in the European maritime region, grouping ports in clusters based on the absence or presence of cruise ship on those ports and determining the diversity of vessels in each port.

Here, we investigated whether and how contrasting-sized canopy openings affect soil nematode community within a 30year-aged spruce plantation. The results indicated that the responses of soil nematodes to canopy opening size were dependant on their feeding habit. The abundance of total nematodes and that of free-living nematodes was negatively correlated with soil bulk density, whereas the abundance of omnivore-predators was negatively correlated with soil bulk density and shrubs cover, respectively. The ratio of the sum abundance of predators and omnivores to the plant parasites' abundance, Simpson's dominance index, Pielou's evenness index, and sigma maturity index, maturity index (MI), MI2-5, basal index, enrichment index, and structure index was sensitive to alteration in canopy opening size. Multivariate analysis indicated that thinning-induced gap size resulted in contrasting nematode assemblages. In conclusion, soil nematodes should be integrated as an indicator to monitor soil multifunctionality change due to thinning.

Five biotic and three diversity indices have been used for determination of water quality of Sangi Stream. The assessment of water quality has been done based on benthic macroinvertebrate and physicochemical parameters. The following biotic indices have been used: Saprobi Index (SI), Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP), Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), Family Biotic Index (FBI), Belgian Biotic Index (BBI), as well as the following diversity indices: Shannon-Weaver index (SWDI), Simpsons index (SDI), Margalef index (MDI) and Evenness (E1). Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied to the physicochemical variables. The similarities between the sampling stations have been clustered by using Cluster analysis (CLUS). Our results have shown the presence of 9 taxonomic groups in Sangi Stream: Crustacea, Oligochaeta, Gastropoda, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Odonata, Coleoptera, and Diptera. The water quality along the Sangi Stream has varied from high class quality in station 1, 2, 3 and 4, to good and moderate quality in station 5 and 6. The results indicate that the SI, BMWP, FBI and ASPT were sufficient in the estimation of water quality in the examined watercourse. This study has clearly shown that a specific biotic index according to the ecological characteristics of Turkey should be developed.

In our present study we assessed the AMF diversity in coal mine abandoned overburden spoils of different age groups viz. 2 years, 10 years and 15 years abandoned site and an un-mined site, through trap culture using Oryza sativa L. and Zea mays L. as host plants. Spore density increases with the increase in age of overburden spoils. Five genera of AMF were isolated v.i.z. Acaulospora, Claroideoglomus, Funneliformis, Glomus and Rhizophagus, where, Acaulospora and Glomus were dominant. In both the trap plants un-mined site derived inoculum showed highest Shannon-Wiener Diversity index and Pielou's Evenness Index value whereas 2 years abandoned site derived inoculum showed lowest diversity index. In case of Simpson's dominance index, 10 years abandoned site derived inoculum has the highest value in Z. mays and 2 years abandoned site derived inoculum has the highest value in O. sativa trap culture respectively. Comparing the two trap plants, O. sativa showed higher colonization percentage, spore density and diversity index indicating that it has a capability to develop maximum interaction with study site derived inoculum. The dominant AMF species can further be utilized in studies for reclamation of abandoned coal mine overburden spoils.																			0973-7510	2581-690X				MAR	2019	13	1					629	636		10.22207/JPAM.13.1.72	http://dx.doi.org/10.22207/JPAM.13.1.72													WOS:000463024400072
J	Huwer, A; Wittig, R				Huwer, Andreas; Wittig, Ruediger			Evidence for increasing homogenization and de-ruralization of the Central European village flora	TUEXENIA												In this study, the spontaneous flora of North Rhine-Westphalian villages (NW Germany) recorded in the periods 1980-1984 and 2004-2005 was analyzed. We asked: (i) Did the similarity of the village flora increase with time and to what extent did non-native species contribute to this? (ii) Is the ongoing trend of urbanization reflected in the village flora? (iii) Regarding the species composition and beta-diversity: are there differences between the results of a repeated survey and of a type comparison? In both periods, 200 villages were visited once, using consistent criteria for village selection and floristic investigation. Of these, a subset of 61 villages was investigated in both time periods and the rest were selected randomly for the second survey but with respect to the same criteria as used in the first. Using different beta -diversity indices (Sorensen index of dissimilarity, Simpson index of dissimilarity and nestedness resultant index) to disentangle pure species turnover and nestedness of species assemblages, we tested whether the similarity among the villages increased over the years. This was done by calculating all pairwise comparisons among the villages of each time period, i.e. their spatial turnover. Additionally, different ecological groups were defined (e.g. "neophytes", "C-strategists" or "urbanophilous species") using the subgroups of species traits (floristic status, Grime's life strategy and urbanity) to indentify urbanization and compositional changes. Our results show that the traditional village flora (species of the Arction lappae, Bidention tripartitae and Potentillion anserinae) is further blurred towards unspecific ubiquitous assemblages found in the periphery of man and that the floristic urbanization is still ongoing. Supported by nearly all ecological groups regarded, our results corroborate that the species composition of Central European villages underwent a considerable degree of homogenization. To some extent this is caused by structural homogenization of villages. Regarding the considerable increase of common ubiquists and a-diversity in general, however, changes in weeding practices seem to be the main reason. Based on the re-investigated subset we could show that comparable results can be obtained by a consistent use of criteria for the selection of villages, even if unpaired samples were used.																			0722-494X						2013		33					213	231																WOS:000324790800010

In order to assess the potential effects of transgenic cry1Ie maize on nonlepidopteran pest species and ecological communities, a 2-year field study was conducted to compare the nonlepidopteran pest abundance, diversity and community composition between transgenic cry1Ie maize (Event IE09S034, Bt maize) and its near isoline (Zong 31, non-Bt maize) by whole plant inspections. Results showed that Bt maize had no effects on non-lepidopteran pest abundance and diversity (ShannonWiener diversity index, Simpson's diversity index, species richness, and Pielou's index). There was a significant effect of year and sampling time on those indices analyzed. Redundancy analysis indicated maize type, sampling time and year totally explained 20.43 % of the variance in the non-lepidopteran pest community composition, but no association was presented between maize type (Bt maize and non-Bt maize) and the variance. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis showed that sampling time and year, rather than maize type had close relationship with the non-lepidopteran pest community composition. These results corroborated the hypothesis that, at least in the short-term, the transgenic cry1Ie maize had negligible effects on the non-lepidopteran pest abundance, diversity and community composition.

Differences in the Vegetation within Deogyusan National Park and the Surrounding Landscape: Implications for National Park Conservation	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												We surveyed the vegetation in Deogyusan National Park (conservation areas) and surrounding areas outside the park (Mt. Juksang, Mt. Johang and Mt. Bonghwa). We calculated plant community indices and diversity indices; these identified properties of the surrounding areas that are relevant to conservation efforts in the park. We compared the diversities of plant communities and plant species between areas using field and quadrat surveys to assign the identities of plant communities to an existing un-delineated preliminary vegetation map produced from aerial photographs. We identified 19 associations. The covers of dominant species in all tree and herb layers were markedly higher in the conservation areas than in the peripheral zone. Mean richness (based on plant community richness and species richness indices) was significantly higher in the conservation area, but mean values of community dominance, diversity, and evenness and the Simpson, Shannon diversity, and evenness indices in the surrounding area were significantly higher than those in the conservation area. Ordination by detrended canonical correspondence analyses showed that elevation and slope explained the distributions of quadrats in the Cartesian space of the ordination. The cover of dominant species in the tree, herb, and sub-tree layers and species numbers in quadrats explained the variation in species compositions within the quadrats. Our results demonstrate that disturbances in the areas surrounding a park can have increasing impacts on plant community and diversity indices. Hence, the preservation and management of surrounding areas are essential conservation elements for protecting whole national park areas.																			1067-4136	1608-3334				NOV	2021	52	6					455	462		10.1134/S1067413621060059	http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S1067413621060059													WOS:000736720800004

Four apple orchards were selected to achieve mentioned aim and 10 pitfall traps were placed in each of the gardens to sample Carabid species. Species richness in gardens managed by organic methods and not pesticides applied was found to be higher than the gardens which were managed with conventional methods and thus applied pesticides. Moreover both the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson diversity indexes were calculated higher in organic apple orchards and found with similar results as species richness for both study years. As expect, dominancy inversely proportional to diversity was measured lower at the gardens managed by organic farming. Population density due to individual of the species, Shannon Evenness, showed mostly unevenly distributed on the graphs at apple orchards managed by conventional methods. The Sorenson Coefficient results, measured monthly between May and August for both years, 2016 and 2017, were defined that the similarities proportion decreased between two different types of the apple orchards (managed by organic, OAF, and conventional, CAF) as long as increasing of pesticide applications. According to the result of the study; as applications of the pesticides increased the richness and diversity of the insect species which present in these kind of agro-ecosystems decreased.

Changes in Holdridge Life Zone diversity in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) of China over the past 40 years	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS												The Holdridge Life Zone model, Shannon's Entropy Index and Simpson's Diversity Index were used to study the dynamics of vegetation distribution over the past 40 years in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR), China. The results indicated that Holdridge Life Zone diversity was highest in the 1960s, dramatically decreased in the 1970s, and then gradually increased in the 1980s and 1990s. From the 1970s, the environment in XUAR seemed to be increasing in stability, as characterized by a reduction in the number of days of sandy dust storm activity in the 1990s, and an increase in temperature and precipitation leading to an increase in water flow in some rivers. It is possible that both changes in human activities and positive climate change contributed to the Holdridge Life Zone diversity dynamics and more stable environment in XUAR. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a large number of studies have demonstrated the influence of soil properties on species diversity, most of them have not considered their spatial variabilities. To remedy the knowledge gap, a 1 ha (100 m x 100 m) plots of arid desert riparian forest was set up in the Ebinur Wetland Nature Reserve (ELWNR) in the NW China. Then, the minimum data set of soil properties (soil MDS) was established using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Norm Value Determination to represent the total soil property data set (soil TDS). The Geo-statistics and two models (i.e., Random Forest/RF and Multiple Linear Regression/MLR) were used to measure the spatial variability of species diversity, and predict its spatial distribution by the soil MDS, respectively. The results showed that the soil MDS was composed of soil salt content (SSC), soil total phosphorus (STP), soil available phosphorus (SAP), soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nitrate nitrogen (SNN); which represented the soil TDS perfectly (R(2 =)0.62). Three species diversity indices (i.e., Shannon-Wiener, Simpson and Pielou indices) had a high spatial dependence (C-0/(C-0+C)< 25%; 0.72 m <= range <= 0.77 m). Ordinary kriging distribution maps showed that the spatial distribution pattern of species diversity predicted by RF model was closer to its actual distribution compared with MLR model. RF model results suggested that the soil MDS had significant effect on spatial distribution of Shannon-Wiener, Simpson and Pielou indices (Var(ex)= 56%, 49% and 36%, respectively). Among all constituents, SSC had the largest contribution on the spatial variability of species diversity (nearly 10%), while STP had least effect (< 5.3%). We concluded that the soil MDS affected spatial variability of species diversity in arid desert riparian forests. Using RF model can predict spatial variability of species diversity through soil properties. Our work provided a new case and insight for studying the spatial relationship between soil properties and plant species diversity.					li, bai/JNE-1502-2023; LI, QI/IUM-8577-2023; Li, Kun/JLL-6505-2023; Li, Ye/JBS-2949-2023; wang, qiang/IZW-1751-2023; Li, bo/IWL-9318-2023	Li, Kun/0000-0002-3638-2974; Yang, Xiao-Dong/0000-0002-3553-2125													1664-462X					NOV 11	2022	13								1014643	10.3389/fpls.2022.1014643	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2022.1014643								36438101					WOS:000889755000001

Chott Sidi Abdel Salam oasis, with an area of approximately 100 ha, was chosen for this study (2018-2019). Aiming to effectively manage and protect the biodiversity of this coastal oasis, the cultivated vegetable, fungal and livestock diversity were investigated using ecological indicators. Our results indicated that the agricultural system in this oasis is traditionally organized into three vegetation layers: palm trees, fruit trees and herbaceous plants. 41 vegetable species, representing 18 families and 32 genera, have been recorded. The highest values of species richness, species diversity, Simpson's concentration of dominance, Simpson's diversity index and equitability of evenness were registered for the lowest layer. Also, 15 fungal families, belonging to 27 genera and 33 species, were recorded in this oasis where the most frequent fungal species were Erysiphe pisi, Leveillula taurica and Sphaerotheca fuliginea. The ongoing results revealed that sheep (35.91%) registered the highest number of livestock, followed by poultry (32.17%). The findings of this study establish basic information on the overall biodiversity status in Chott Sidi Abdel Salam coastal oasis; some recommendations to maintain and conserve this rare agrosystem are also presented in this paper.

Observer error in grassland vegetation surveys: effects on species diversity metrics and species-abundance relationships	JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY												We investigated the effect of observer error on four commonly used species diversity measures: species richness, Shannon-Weiner diversity, Shannon-Weiner evenness and Simpson's index of diversity. We also evaluated how observer error affects inferences derived from multivariate analyses of species-abundance relationships as determined by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination. Grassland vegetation was sampled by three different botanists at two national park units in Missouri and Kansas, USA. The same plots were sampled by two of the botanists, who compiled lists of species composition and estimated foliar cover. Differences in the data records were then compared. Pseudoturnover (i.e. apparent turnover due to observer error) ranged from 17.1% to 22.1%, and differences in cover class estimation ranged from 21.5% to 30.5%. The percentage difference in species diversity measures between pairs of observers depended on how data were summarized, but were always <20%, and often <10%. Based on these results, species diversity metrics are affected to a relatively smaller extent by observer error than turnover indices. Turnover indices, however, contain more information because they track individual species, whereas species are interchangeable in most species diversity indices. Thus, less of the error is identified because of how species diversity indices are calculated. NMS ordinations revealed that while the characterizations of some plots by different observers were similar, differences between observers' records for other plots resulted in greater separation in ordination space. Points representing one observer's records were often shifted in ordination space in the same direction compared with the other observer.

Diversity analyses revealed the presence of algal members belonging to all major divisions, with a predominance of Cyanophyta. Shannon-Wiener and Simpson's diversity indices illustrated low microalgal diversity in sewage wastewater. Highest chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 14,000 mg L-1 was recorded in December 2012. Spectrometric analyses of sewage wastewater revealed the presence of heavy metals, with Cr ranging from 3 to 4 mg L-1 being detected in all the samples collected over the year. A positive correlation was found between COD and total heavy metal concentration (r = 0.77). The indices of microalgal diversity showed a positive correlation with nutrients and a negative correlation with COD and heavy metal concentrations, implying the significant role of these factors in influencing the algal population. Phormidium sp. was the dominant genus present throughout the year. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on field surveys and indoor analyses, this study investigated the relationship between species diversity and community stability at different stages of bare patch succession in degraded alpine meadow ecosystems. Results show that: (1) Using the ICV (the Inverse of the Coefficient of Variation) method to analyze changes in plant community stability, community stability was generally ranked as follows: Long-term recovered patches > Healthy alpine meadow > Degraded alpine meadow > Short-term recovered patch > Bare Patches. (2) Using factor analysis to construct an evaluation system, the stability ranking based on species diversity was as follows: Healthy alpine meadow > Long-term recovered patches > Degraded alpine meadow > Short-term recovered patches > Bare Patches. (3) The community stability index was significantly positively correlated with vegetation coverage, height, biomass, species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, species evenness, and Simpson's diversity index (p < 0.05). Therefore, a positive correlation exists between plant diversity and community stability, such that plant communities with a higher species diversity tend to be more stable. To maintain the plant diversity and community stability of alpine meadow ecosystems, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of grassland plant composition and community structure, as well as their influencing factors, and promote the positive succession process of grasslands.																				2223-7747				OCT	2023	12	20							3582	10.3390/plants12203582	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants12203582								37896045					WOS:001092474200001

A total of 93 tree species of 85 genera belonging to 24 families were encountered. The tree stand density varied from 458-728 individuals ha(-1) with the average basal area ranging from 5.96 - 19.31 m(2) ha(-1). Shannon-Weiner Index (H') ranged from 0.67 - 0.79. The Simpson Index of dominance varied from 0.08 - 0.16, the Margalef's Species Richness Index varied from 21.41 - 23.71, Equitability or evenness index varied from 0.02 - 0.05, the species heterogeneity index varied from 2.53 - 3.61 and 6 diversity varied from 2.05 - 4.87. A greater number of tree species fell in 41 - 50 cm DBH followed by 21 30 cm, 0 - 10 cm diameter class, but less. number of tree individuals are represented in above 100 cm diameter class. The Combretaceae was represented by the highest number of species (9 spp.) followed by Rutaceae (7 spp.). Each of the individual soil variables showed a high positive correlation with tree species richness while tree density showed a clearly negative correlation with variables like phosphorous and nitrogen and positive correlation with carbon.																			0564-3295	2661-8982				WIN	2010	51	2					273	279																WOS:000275880600013

Potamogeton pectinatus may simultaneously reproduce sexually and asexually and plays an important role in sustaining freshwater ecosystem; however, its populations declined dramatically in China recently. We used inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers to genotype 324 ramets of P. pectinatus from 17 extant Chinese populations. In all, 192 genets were identified. The proportion of distinguishable genets, Nei's gene diversity index, and Simpson's diversity index exhibited considerable levels of clonal and genetic diversity in P. pectinatus populations. Character compatibility analysis revealed that sexual reproduction, rather than clonal reproduction, plays a predominant role in preserving genetic variation of those populations. Seed recruitments, enhanced by habitat disturbances, might partly counteract the effects of habitat loss on genetic diversity of P. pectinatus populations.					wang, xiaoqiang/JMT-2783-2023														1565-9801	2224-4662					2012	58	1					27	38		10.1560/IJEE.58.1.27	http://dx.doi.org/10.1560/IJEE.58.1.27													WOS:000313111500002

The endemic plant diversity and all vascular plant diversity indices were calculated for each sample plot using Simpson index. Regression analysis was performed between environmental factors, plant diversity and canopy closure. Endemic plant diversity showed a positive correlation with vascular plant diversity, and a negative correlation with slope position and altitude. A significant quadric relationship was observed between the endemic plant diversity and aspect variable. RDA (redundancy analysis) and CCA (canonical correspondence analysis) based on linear regressions were applied to determine the environmental factors affecting the distribution of endemic species, and the best model based on total variance explained was selected. According to RDA based on linear regression, habitat selection of endemics is strongly correlated with aspect, slope position and altitude. Lower altitude zone (300-500 m), the north aspect and lower slope including valley bottom of Yazili canyon were observed to be the most suitable areas for endemics.

The current study will be the first report on species diversity, species composition, abundance, and distributional pattern of moth fauna in Aravalli Hill Range Rajasthan. During the survey period of 2018-2019, 758 specimens of moths were collected pertaining to 34 species, 26 genera belonging to 05 families, and 13 subfamilies from three different sites of Aravalli Hill Range. Based on the number of genera, family Sphingidae was most dominant with 9 genera, and family Crambidae was least dominant with 2 genera. Based on the number of species, the family Sphingidae was the most dominant, representing 13 species, followed by Erebidae representing 11 species, Saturniidae and Noctuidae with 4 species each, the least dominant was Crambidae with 2 species. The diversity indices for moths have been calculated for the first time from the Aravalli Range of Rajasthan. Across the survey, Simpson's Diversity Index (D0), Shannon Diversity Index (H0), Dominance & Evenness was calculated as 0.95, 3.3, 0.04, and 0.8, respectively, which reflects that moth fauna is diverse in the surveyed areas.

However, accurate biodiversity mapping requires exact distributional information as inputs. When exact geographical coordinate information is missing or when only coarse distribution of species is available at the quadrat or plot level, how can we effectively infer and compare spatial distributional patterns of species with reasonable accuracy while controlling the confounding impacts of scale dependency? A crossing-scale coefficient of variation (CCV) is calculated for three simple diversity indices, the Shannon, Gini-Simpson and reciprocal-Simpson evenness indices, from the quadrat-based biodiversity data over varying sampling grain sizes for subtly measuring overall spatial distributional pattern of species in a survey map. Extensive numerical simulations showed that, when the overall distribution of organisms was regular, CCV tended to be very small, for all the three evenness indices. By contrast, when the distribution was highly aggregate, CCV tended to be large. Finally, an intermediate CCV was observed when organism distribution was random. To this end, all the three evenness indices can detect the subtle change on aggregate or regular distribution. Among the indices, the Gini-Simpson evenness index is the most insensitive to both the change of population size of species and the number of sampling grain sizes used. Compared to available spatial statistic metrics that requires exact geographical coordinates as inputs, CCV is a useful metric for assessing the overall spatial distribution pattern of a species across sampling plots in which exact spatial coordinates of each individual are unavailable. Empirical applications of the CCV metric showed that plants in habitat patches extensively managed by humans can present very aggregate distributional pattern, being counterintuitive to the usual expectation that plants in cultivated or planted land should present regular distributional pattern. The present study recommends one effective tool, the combination of CCV and evenness indices, for exploring the overall spatial distributional pattern of a single species under the quadrat-sampling scheme. The proposed method is particularly suitable to handle ecological data for which the finest-scale distributional coordinate information of each individual of species is missing.

Bedroom floor dust was collected at age 3 months and 4 bacterial and fungal diversity measures [number of observed operational taxonomic units (OTUs), Chao1, Shannon and Simpson indices] were calculated from Illumina MiSeq sequencing data. Hyperactivity/inattention was based on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at ages 10 and 15 (cut-off >= 7). Adjusted associations between 4 diversity measures in tertiles and hyperactivity/inattention were investigated with weighted and survey logistic regression models. We included 226 individuals with information on microbial diversity and hyperactivity/inattention. Early life bacterial diversity was inversely associated with hyperactivity/inattention at age 10 [bacterial OTUs (medium vs low: aOR = 0.4, 95%CI = (0.2-0.8)) and Chao1 (medium vs low: 0.3 (0.1-0.5); high vs low: 0.3 (0.2-0.6)], whereas fungal diversity was directly associated [Chao1 (high vs low: 2.1 (1.1-4.0)), Shannon (medium vs low: 2.8 (1.3-5.8)), and Simpson (medium vs low: 4.7 (2.4-9.3))]. At age 15, only Shannon index was significantly associated with hyperactivity/inattention [bacteria (medium vs low: 2.3 (1.2-4.2); fungi (high vs low: 0.5 (0.3-0.9))]. In conclusion, early life exposure to microbial diversity may play a role in the psychobehavioural development. We observe heterogeneity in the direction of the associations encouraging further longitudinal studies to deepen our understanding of the characteristics of the microbial community underlying the observed associations.

We used plant species, soil, and AMF from a remnant sand savanna in setting up the experiment, using two light and five AMF treatments. Eleven plant species were seeded into 80 microcosms, and they were grown together for 20 weeks. Plant numbers and biomass were measured, and Simpson's index was calculated for both. Data were analyzed using ANOVA and nonparametric ANOVA. We found significant light effects on biomass and on numbers of four species. There were no treatment effects on Simpson's index, and only Schizachyrium numbers showed a significant AMF effect. These findings are consistent with results from other studies of the sand savanna, and, collectively, these data suggest that plant community composition in this species-rich savanna is not strongly influenced by arbuscular mycorrhizae. This is a novel finding with important implications for understanding interactions between plant and AMF diversity in wild communities.																			0940-6360	1432-1890				NOV	2005	15	7					547	553		10.1007/s00572-005-0365-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00572-005-0365-2								15952016					WOS:000232795000009

Various composition and configuration metrics were used to analyze characteristics of land cover and its spatial heterogeneity. Satellite images (i.e., SPOT) were used to classify land cover. Pattern analyses were conducted in Erdemli district of Mersin, Turkey, from coastline to about 200m ASL. Landscape patterns were quantified and mapped on the basis of number of patches (NP), edge density (ED), largest patch index (LPI), aggregation index (AI), Shannon's and Simpson's diversity and evenness indices (SHDI, SIDI, SHEI, STET). A relationship between observed patterns/calculated indices and current land uses were investigated. Results showed that many of the pattern features differed between the coast and upper lands due to varying composition and configuration characteristics of land cover types under investigation.

Prompt effect of replacing the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine with the 13-valent vaccine on the epidemiology of invasive pneumococcal disease in Norway	VACCINE												The introduction of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in the childhood immunisation programme in Norway in 2006 substantially decreased the incidence of vaccine-type (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in all age groups. Additionally, a slight increase in the non-vaccine (NVT) serotype IPD incidence (serotype replacement) was observed. After replacing PCV7 with PCV13 in 2011, a further decrease in IPD incidence is expected. However, the protection by the six additional serotypes opens new nasopharyngeal niches for colonisation, which favours conditions for serotype replacement. Close monitoring of IPD therefore remains important in order to quickly detect changes. In this observational retrospective population-based cohort study we used data notified nationally between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2012 to determine the VT- and NVT-IPD incidences. The diversity in serotype distribution per year was analysed using the Simpson's index of diversity. Immunisation history of young children was obtained from the Norwegian Vaccination Registry to determine vaccine failure. The incidence of VT-IPD decreased in the targeted (<5 years) and non-targeted (>= 5) age groups since PCV7 introduction and further decreased after the replacement with PCV13. Only two cases of vaccine failure were identified. This indicates very high effectiveness of the 2 + 1 schedules with PCV7 or PCV13 and suggests that non-vaccinated individuals profit through indirect protection. The decrease in incidence of PCV7-IPD in non-targeted age groups became larger in later years, indicating a lag phase for the indirect effects, and suggests that the indirect protection of PCV13 will increase in coming years. The incidence of some NVT, specifically serotypes 23B and 15A, increased after PCV13 introduction. This coincided with an increased Simpson's index of diversity in the targeted age group. As this suggests that serotype replacement is again occurring, continues monitoring of IPD is important so that adaptations to vaccine recommendations can be promptly issued. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Inventory and diversity of forages utilized by farmers raising goats in Halal way: The case of Region XII, Philippines	JOURNAL OF LIVESTOCK SCIENCE												In small ruminant production, resource inventory is necessary. Among these, forage inventory and assessment are essential considering the fact that it is a major source of feedstuff for animals. In the Philippines, pioneering Halal goat research have been conducted in Region XII, however, forage inventory utilized in Halal goat production has not been done. This study aims to provide information on different species of plant utilized by goat raisers as forage. The study was conducted in 3 provinces of Region XII, namely North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and South Cotabato, and General Santos City. Four (4) municipalities/cities in each province were included in the assessment. Respondents in each area were selected based on the following criteria from the drafted Philippine National Standards for Halal goat production: a.) a believer of Islam b) with 5 to 24 breeder does; and c.) willingness of the farm owner to participate in the survey in addition to the established basic consideration for Halal goat raising. Respondents were interviewed using a semi-structured questionnaire. A total of 61 species of plants belonging to 19 families were utilized as forage by the respondents. Carabao grass (Paspalum conjugatum Bergius) is the most common species of forage with a relative abundance of 0.0949. This was followed by walis-walisan (Sida acuta Burm.f.) (0.0586), napier (Pennisetum purpureum Schum.) (0.0566), paragrass (Brachiaria mutica (Forssk.) Stapf.) (0.0566), ipil-ipil (Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) de Wit-) (0.0545), and paragis (Eleusine indica (L.) Gaertn.) (0.0525). Higher diversity of forage species was recorded in Columbio, Sultan Kudarat based on the computed Simpson's Diversity (0.05322), Simpson's Index of Diversity (0.9468) and Shannon-Weiner Index (3.097). Differences in forage species diversity in all sampling sites were observed. Although all sampling sites are within one region, variability in land covers and climatic conditions can be attributed to species diversity difference.

See vol. 17, 2022)	PLOS ONE												Citrus is a valuable crop in Pakistan. It is rich in vitamin C, other nutrients and antioxidants. Huanglongbing (HLB) caused by a bacterium "Candidatus liberibacter asiaticus" (CLas), africanus and americanus has an influence on citrus production around the world. Beside HLB there exist several other bacterial species in citrus groves in Pakistan. The structure and diversity of bacterial species in various ecosystems can be quickly examined using NGS. This approach is considerably quicker and more precise than outdated methods. Healthy or citrus greening infected leaf samples of Grapefruit (Citrus paradisi), C. aurantifolia, and C. reticulata Blanco were used for diversity analysis. In this study high throughput, NGS technique was used to access the population of both cultivable and non-cultivable bacterial endophytes from citrus leaves, by using PCR amplicons of 16S rDNA sequences (V5-V7 regions) with Illumina Hi seq. As a result, a total number of 68,722 sequences were produced from the test samples. According to the NGS-based diversity classification, the most common genera of exploited bacterial endophytes were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Cyanobacteria, and Actinobacteria. C. aurantifolia and C. paradisi showed almost equal diversity, whereas C. reticulata Blanco had a higher proportion of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria in their leaves. To determine alpha diversity (AD), additional data was analyzed using statistical indices such as Shannon, Chao1, and Simpson. According to the inverse Simpson diversity index, the abundance of the microbial population in six different citrus samples was 0.48, 0.567, and 0.163, respectively. The metagenomics of microbiota in plant tissues was successfully recorded by NGS technology, which can help us learn more about the interactions between plants and microbes. This research is the first step toward a better understanding of 16SrRNA-based metagenomics from citrus in Pakistan using Illumina (Hi seq) Technology.																			1932-6203						2022	17	4							e0263144	10.1371/journal.pone.0263144	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263144								35417473					WOS:000791994200043

V.; Tsubo, Mitsuru; Walker, Sue; Newby, Terry			Soil chemical properties and plant species diversity along a rainfall gradient in semi-arid grassland of South Africa	PLANT ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Background and aims - Plant diversity is affected by several biotic and abiotic influences that include the availability of soil nutrients and precipitation regimes. Our study investigated the relationship between soil chemical properties and plant diversity in semi-arid grasslands of South Africa. Methods - We collected plant species data and determined soil chemical compositions in Kimberley, Bloemfontein and Bethlehem. The three locations lie along an increasing rainfall gradient from around 450 to 750 mm per annum. We conducted ANOVA to examine differences in diversity indicators [species richness (N-0), the inverse Simpson diversity index (N-2) and species evenness (N-20 = N-2/N-0 among the locations, and differences in soil chemical properties (Ca, K, Mg, Na, P, N, C and pH). We further performed correlation analysis between soil variables and diversity indicators: Key results - The geographical gradients of N-0 and N-2 were positively associated with the rainfall gradient and correspondingly with N and C. However, N-0 and N-2 were negatively correlated with soil pH. N-20 did not show any relationships with the geographical gradient and soil properties. Our results further revealed a hump-shaped model of N-0 with soil pH, characterised by an increase in N-0 with increasing soil pH in acidic grassland (Bethlehem) but a decrease and levelling-off in the lower rainfall, alkaline grasslands of Bloemfontein and Kimberley. The negative effect of soil pH on N-0 is presumably a result of less intense leaching of the base cations in the lower rainfall areas of Bloemfontein and Kimberley. Conclusions - Our results indicate soil pH as the main variable determining plant species diversity in semi-arid grasslands.

The water parameters were estimated following Trivedy and Goel (Environ Publ 6:10-12, 1986) and APHA (American Public Health Association, Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, Method, 2005), while biodiversity indices were used to calculate the algal diversity, richness, evenness and similarity index. The result revealed that pH and the concentrations of Fe, Ni, Mn, and Zn were found to be significantly elevated as compared to BIS/WHO recommended level for drinking water. A total of 29 algal species belonging to 12 families were enumerated from the 4 seasons. Biodiversity indices such as Margalef richness index, Shannon-Weiner index, and Simpson's diversity presented maximum values in summer while Pielou's evenness did not vary significantly between seasons. Sorenson's index presented the lowest similarity (25%) and highest dissimilarity (75%) between winter and spring. The water quality status revealed that Simsang river water is deteriorated and needs to be pre-treated before utilization. Furthermore, the river condition as observed during the study period felt the necessity to adopt proper management policy and conservation efforts by the local inhabitants to protect the Simsang river.

J	Ferguson, SH; Berube, DKA				Ferguson, SH; Berube, DKA			Invertebrate diversity under artificial cover in relation to boreal forest habitat characteristics	CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST												We investigated invertebrate diversity in boreal forests using an experimental design that consisted of counting soil invertebrates under artificial cover. The aim was to assess the utility of using soil invertebrate diversity as a measure of ecosystem health. The study area was grouped into five habitats: upland hardwood, lowland hardwood, conifer, shrub, and conifer-grass. Simpson's and Shannon's indices of invertebrate diversity were negatively correlated with percent herbaceous cover. Number of recognizable taxonomic units (RTU richness) was negatively correlated with percent litter cover. The number of individual invertebrates was positively correlated with soil moisture and negatively correlated with percent conifer cover. Invertebrate diversity varied among habitat types, with conifer forests (spruce, fir, pine) having the highest diversity and regenerating conifer-grass forests having the lowest diversity, suggesting that successional stages affect diversity. The most productive sites, upland and lowland hardwood habitats, had the highest abundance of soil invertebrates, although intermediate diversity compared to the other five habitats. The results are consistent with the view that diversity increases and then decreases with productivity and disturbance over succession (ca. 50- 100 yr). Hence, maintenance of soil invertebrate diversity in managed boreal forests requires the provision of a varied landscape with a mosaic of disturbance regimes.																			0008-3550					JUL-SEP	2004	118	3					386	394		10.22621/cfn.v118i3.9	http://dx.doi.org/10.22621/cfn.v118i3.9													WOS:000232870300010

We examined different indices that are frequently used in literature as for their sensitivity and ability in tracing vegetation changes during a post-fire succession. Field data from a forest in Sithonia peninsula, northern Greece, during a period of 10 years after a fire event were used as a case study. In order to detect the best model fit of diversity and evenness indices we used pseudovalues generated with the jackknife method. The index of evenness and diversity with the lowest coefficient of variation scores were selected as the ones with the best model fit. In order to select the abundance model with the best model fit we compared the difference of the observed abundances data from the jackknife-predicted ones using the Akaike information criterion. According to our results, in rich and medium soil types, the best diversity ecosystem index from the ones examined was the (inverse) Berger-Parker one, while in poor soil types the Simpson or Brillouin diversity index. According to our results, in rich and medium soil type Mediterranean ecosystems, a good biodiversity ecosystem descriptor is based on how abundant is the most abundant species. In poor soil types where there are fewer species, and the percentage of cover is lower, indices that account for the relative representation of species within the community structure are better biodiversity ecosystem descriptors. All evenness indices examined but the Smith-Wilson were good ecosystem descriptors. The abundance model that showed the best model fit was the log series one. The poor fit of the Smith-Wilson's index suggests that in species poor ecosystems the number of species is more important than species variance.

Using diversity pattern indicators and other data obtained through geographic information systems (GIS) and spatial data on Moraceae species obtained from published data, we quantitatively studied the spatial diversity patterns of genera in the Moraceae in China. The results revealed that the patch richness, diversity index, and total shape index of the genera with multiple species were significantly higher than those of the monotypic genera. Monotypic genera had no spatial diversity and no distribution in patterns of spatial diversity. Maclura had the most concentrated spatial distribution and the lowest distribution area among the Moraceae in China. The number of patches and the total area were the smallest, while the most significant patch index was the highest. Maclura had no spatial diversity. Streblus had the highest patch abundance compared to other genera with fewer species. Streblus had the smallest number of patches and total area of distribution, the lowest spatial distribution, and a small total shape index, indicating its concentrated distribution. The values of the Shannon's Diversity Index (SHDI) and Simpson's Diversity Index (SIDI) were the highest, and the spatial distribution was the most diverse among the genera with fewer species. The patch type of Streblus had a more considerable value than other genera, but the number of patches was small, and the total shape index was low. Streblus was primarily distributed in the south of Yunnan, western Guangxi, the west and central parts of Hainan, and southern Guangdong. Most of these areas were mountainous. The temperature decreased with elevation, providing diverse environmental conditions for the narrow-stem genus. Among the Moraceae in China, the spatial distribution of Ficus was the most diverse, with the highest number of patches, patch types, total shape index, SHDI, and SIDI values. The spatial diversity of Ficus could be used as a protected area for Moraceae in China.																			2296-701X					MAR 31	2023	11								1110018	10.3389/fevo.2023.1110018	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2023.1110018													WOS:000967935600001

In this study, we studied the relationship between soil, topography in terms of slope and elevation, and parent material with the land morphology and physical and chemical properties of soil, how the soil formed and evolved. From 19 control soil profiles, 57 soil samples were obtained from three layers and some soil characteristics including Acidity, Salinity, Gypsum, Lime, Texture and Organic matter were measured. Using NEWHALL software, the soil temperature and moisture regime was determined. To study the conditions of topography, the digital elevation map and slope was prepared, the characteristics of geological formations were determined and based on the Gower index and Jacquard index, the relationship between soil evolution factors with topography and parent materials were studied. The diversity of soils classification was studied using richness, uniformity of Shannon and Simpson indices. Based on the results obtained from Gower and jacquard similarity indices, the effect of topography and parent materials on soil diversity was proved. Soil diversity indices showed an increasing trend from the soil order level to the soil family. The increase in the Richness index was higher at the soil family level, so that the highest soil diversity observed at the soil family level. Also, soil diversity is mainly affected by intrinsic factors and to some extent by environmental factors. Soil profile development is mostly influenced by slope, parent materials and in some areas by groundwater level.																			1818-6742	1995-9516				DEC	2020	33	2					476	489																WOS:000613737700021

To do so, we first analyse the origin and diffusion of the discourse on cultural diversity, along with political practices re-lated to integration and inclusion at various administrative levels. Subsequently, cultural di-versity is measured using the Simpson's Index for the main urban and smaller rural regions. Finally, we analyse political practices and consequences at different administrative scales. The 15 urban areas with more than half a million inhabitants in 2020 are considered. For rural areas, municipalities with less than 2,000 inhabitants that are not included in urban areas are analysed. The analysis is carried out both for the population as a whole and from a generational perspective, comparing diversity between and within generations.																			1138-5774	2341-0833					2023	59								023	10.14422/mig.2023.023	http://dx.doi.org/10.14422/mig.2023.023													WOS:001138489300002

The river is originated from the Ganges-Padma River system, a trans-boundary river between India and Bangladesh. Once the river was rich in fish biodiversity, but due to man-made and natural causes the availability of fish reduced drastically. A comprehensive analysis of fish diversity indices, gear efficiency, catch composition and decline causes of fish diversity in Gorai River, Bangladesh was accomplished. The data were collected on monthly basis from January to December 2018 from three major fishing sites of the river. A total of 62 fish and 2 prawn species under 12 orders and 24 families were recorded. Cypriniformes was the leading order consisting 27% of the total catch. The mean values of Shannon-Weaver diversity (H'), Simpson's index (1-D), Margalef's richness (d) and Pielou's evenness (J') indices were recorded as, 1.478 +/- 0.495, 0.57 +/- 0.197, 15.115 +/- 4.435 and 0.481 +/- 0.152, respectively. At the similarity of 58.7%, two groups were attained in the cluster analysis and the Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) showed 40% similarity among the three sites in twelve months based on the Bray-Curtis similarity matrix. The highest and lowest CPUE were recorded from seine net (5.2 +/- 1.72 kg gear(-1) haul(-1)) and hook & long lines (0.0135 +/- 0.0015 kg gear(-1) haul(-1)), respectively whereas, highest and lowest gear efficiency were recorded from lift net (0.321 +/- 0.036 kg gear(-1) person(-1 )hour(-1)) and fish trap (0.0005 +/- 0.0002 kg gear(-1 )person(-1) hour(-1)), respectively. Alternatively, the highest fish catch was recorded on April (21228 +/- 464.38 kg) and lowest on August (3855 +/- 138.21 kg). According to the fishermen fish biodiversity of the Gorai River declined day by day due to overexploitation, destructive fishing practice, pollution, construction of obstacles for fish movement, and natural causes like siltation. Proper implementation of fish acts and regulations, use of authorized fishing gear, community-based fisheries management, sanctuary establishment and management, stocking of fish fingerling, and raising public awareness can play a great role in enhancing and conserving fish biodiversity in the Gorai River of Bangladesh.

However, the influence of diet on the bacterial flora of different skin sites is not well understood. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between dietary patterns (DPs) and skin bacterial flora on the forearm (a dry site) and the neck (a sebaceous site) of healthy Korean adults.Methods and results In metagenomics analysis, Shannon and Simpson indices were higher on the forearm than on the neck and were negatively correlated with the two dominant species, Cutibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis, on two skin sites. In addition, the Simpson index of the forearm was positively associated with DP1 (characterized by a high intake of vegetables, mushrooms, meat, fish and shellfish, seaweed, and fat and oil), while that on the neck was negatively associated with DP2 (characterized by a high intake of fast food). A high intake of DP1 was associated with a lower abundance of dominant species, including C. acnes, and higher degrees of the co-occurrence network, whereas a high intake of DP2 was associated with the opposite pattern.Conclusions Specific diets may impact both skin bacterial diversity and composition, as well as the co-occurrence of bacteria, which may vary across different skin sites.																			1364-5072	1365-2672				SEP 5	2023	134	9							lxad211	10.1093/jambio/lxad211	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jambio/lxad211								37699790					WOS:001094627700003

Given the growing evidence that gut microbiota was involved in psychiatric disorders, we aimed to identify the characteristic composition of the gut microbiota in ADHD. Methods: We recruited 47 medication-naive children and adolescents with ADHD, and 60 healthy controls (HCs). We used shotgun metagenomics to measure the structure of the gut microbiota and analyzed the difference in bacterial taxa between ADHD and HCs. Results: Significant differences were found between the ADHD and HC groups in both alpha diversity indices (Simpson index, p = .025 and Shannon index, p = .049) and beta diversity indices (Euclidean distance, Bray-Curtis distance, and JSD distance, p < 2.2e-16). Nine representative species best explain the difference. Conclusion: Patients with ADHD showed significant differences in the composition of the gut microbiota compared with HCs. These results may help identify potential biomarkers of ADHD.

The maintenance mechanism of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) relationship between different dimensions of biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality in alpine meadows on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau was still unclear. This paper investigates the elevation patterns of species, functions, and phylogenetic diversity of plant communities in alpine meadows on the eastern Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau and their effects on EMF using factor analysis and the radial basis function (RBF) neural network model. The results showed that (1) the species and phylogenetic diversity indices (except MPD index) increased and then decreased with elevation; the functional diversity indices FRic and FEve showed a decreasing trend with elevation, while FDiv showed the opposite. (2) Ecosystem multifunctional indices for the five elevation gradients were 3000 m > 3250 m > 3500 m > 3750 m > 4000 m. There were significant correlations between biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Species richness, Simpson, FRic, and FDiv increased with increasing EMF, but the relationship between phylogenetic diversity and EMF was insignificant. (3) Among the biodiversity indices, species richness and functional richness indices had a greater impact on EMF and were also important drivers to explain changes in EMF, followed by PD indices. The high biodiversity of alpine meadows can contribute to the supply of multifunctional ecosystems, making them healthier and more stable.

We aimed to compare the diversity and composition of lung bacteria among severe pneumonia patients who were influenza virus positive (IFVP) and influenza virus negative (IFVN).MethodsBronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were procured from patients diagnosed with severe pneumonia to investigate the microbiome utilizing 16S-rDNA sequencing. The alpha diversity of the microbiome was evaluated employing Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson indexes, while the beta diversity was assessed using principal component analysis and principal coordinate analysis. Linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) was employed to determine the taxonomic differences between the IFVP and IFVN groups.ResultsA total of 84 patients with 42 in the IFVP group and 42 in the IFVN group were enrolled. Slightly higher indexes of Shannon and Simpson were observed in the IFVP group without statistically significant difference. The dominant bacterial genera were Streptococcus, Klebsiella, Escherichia-Shigella in the IFVN group and Acinetobacter, Streptococcus, Staphylococcus in the IFVP group. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii were the most abundant species in the IFVN and IFVP groups, respectively. LEfSe analysis indicated a greater abundance of Klebsiella in the IFVN group.ConclusionsIndividuals with severe pneumonia infected with IFV exhibit heightened susceptibility to certain bacteria, especially Acinetobacter baumannii, and the underlying mechanism of the interaction between IFV and Acinetobacter baumannii in the progression of pneumonia needs further investigation.					liang, shuang/JOK-5869-2023; Liu, Yaqiong/AAH-2338-2019; zhao, wei/JZD-4475-2024															1476-0711				JUN 2	2023	22	1							43	10.1186/s12941-023-00590-2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12941-023-00590-2								37264437					WOS:000998588400001
J	KVALSETH, TO				KVALSETH, TO			NOTE ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY, EVENNESS, AND HOMOGENEITY MEASURES	OIKOS												This paper is concerned with the measurement of diversity of a biological or ecological sample of individuals belonging to various species. Using the concept of statistical odds, an alternative diversity measure with an appealing interpretation is formulated as a simple modification of the popular Simpson index. If SIGMA-p(i)2 denotes the sum of the squared proportions of individuals belonging to the different species in the sample, the new odds measure of diversity is simply defined by OD = (SIGMA-p(i)2)-1-1 and has the following interpretation: OD is the odds that two individuals selected at random (with replacement) from the sample are of different species. The same modification is also applied to a couple of other measures in use, providing them with convenient odds interpretations. These measures are all members of the same parameterized family, which represents a slight modification of the Hill's family. The inverse of OD is proposed as an odds measure of species homogeneity. Also, some properties of the different measures are outlined, and the measurement of evenness is discussed. Finally, some new indices of individual species dominance and surprise are briefly mentioned.																			0030-1299	1600-0706				OCT	1991	62	1					123	127		10.2307/3545460	http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3545460													WOS:A1991GP45000023
J	Yan, H; Li, F; Liu, GX				Yan, Hui; Li, Fei; Liu, Guixiang			Diminishing influence of negative relationship between species richness and evenness on the modeling of grassland α-diversity metrics	FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Species richness and evenness have been widely used to investigate the spatiotemporal variation of alpha-diversity. However, some studies have indicated that a negative relationship exists between species richness and evenness. The question is how the differing sensitivity of alpha-diversity metrics and interactive behavior between richness and evenness affect the modeling of alpha-diversity variation. Here, we explored the response of species diversity, represented by three Hill numbers (i.e., species richness, exponential of Shannon index - expShannon, and inverse of Simpson index - invSimpson) focusing on the abundance of rare and common species, and Pielou index underlining the evenness of a community, to alpha-diversity variation through structural equation modeling (SEM). The model scheme integrated three categories of variables, spectral variation hypothesis (SVH), community pattern, and vertical structure, along the precipitation gradient spanning three steppes, including meadow steppe, typical steppe, and desert steppe. Our results showed that there were large differences in species richness across the three steppes, with v-shaped patterns emerging along the gradient (low-point in the typical steppe). Differences between steppes were diminished in the expShannon or invSimpson indices, though the v-shaped patterns persisted. The Pielou index showed the opposite pattern, with the peak in the typical steppe. Accordingly, a negative relationship between species richness and Pielou index was found across the three steppes. The concurrent increases in annual species number and dominant species abundance in response to precipitation variations led to the negative relationship. As a result, the SEM fitness on expShannon and invSimpson indices over the region was substantially diminished by the negative relationship. Overall, community pattern better explained the variation in species richness, invSimpson and Pielou indices. The performance of SVH differed among alpha-diversity metrics due to the collinearity with the variables of community pattern and vertical structure. This study emphasizes the variability of alpha-diversity metrics in response to environmental change. Particularly, distinguishing the asynchronous behaviors between species richness and evenness is paramount to account for alpha-diversity variation over heterogeneous ecosystems.

In this context, techniques of spectral mixture analysis may have an advantage over traditional methods of land cover classification because they allow to decompose the spectral signature of a mixed pixel into several endmembers and their respective abundances. In this work, we present the application of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to quantify habitat diversity and assess the compositional turnover at different spatial scales in the fine-grained landscapes of the Cantabrian Mountains (northwestern Iberian Peninsula). A Landsat-8 OLI scene and high-resolution orthophotographs (25 cm) were used to build a region-specific spectral library of the main types of habitats in this region (arboreal vegetation; shrubby vegetation; herbaceous vegetation; rocks-soil and water bodies). We optimized the spectral library with the Iterative Endmember Selection (IES) method and we applied MESMA to unmix the Landsat scene into five fraction images representing the five defined habitats (root mean square error, RMSE <= 0.025 in 99.45% of the pixels). The fraction images were validated by linear regressions using 250 reference plots from the orthophotographs and then used to calculate habitat diversity at the pixel (alpha-diversity: 30 x 30 m), landscape (gamma-diversity: 1 x 1 km) and regional (epsilon-diversity: 110 x 33 km) scales and the compositional turnover (beta- and delta-diversity) according to Simpson's diversity index. Richness and evenness were also computed. Results showed that fraction images were highly related to reference data (R-2 >= 0.73 and RMSE <= 0.18). In general, our findings indicated that habitat diversity was highly dependent on the spatial scale, with values for the Simpson index ranging from 0.20 +/- 0.22 for alpha-diversity to 0.60 +/- 0.09 for gamma-diversity and 0.72 +/- 0.11 for epsilon-diversity. Accordingly, we found beta-diversity to be higher than delta-diversity. This work contributes to advance in the estimation of ecological diversity in complex landscapes, showing the potential of MESMA to quantify habitat diversity in a comprehensive way using Landsat imagery.

With increasing intensity of land use the network afield hedges is threatened by fragmentation. To analyze the effects of different hedge sizes on carabid beetle communities (Coleoptera. Carabidae) several diversity and similarity indices were considered. Carabids were sampled with pitfall traps from April to October 2008 on the Filderebene near Stuttgart (Baden-Wurttemberg/Germany). The diversity indices of Shannon-Weaver. Simpson and Fisher show no dependence of carabid beetle diversity on hedge size, while species richness is negative and evenness is positive correlated with hedge size. Furthermore, it can be shown that the effect of fragmentation is established on species level, because the dominance of eurytope forest species declines with increasing fragmentation in favor of species typical for open habitats. The similarity index (Wainstein) suggests that carabid beetle communities in small hedges resemble each other more than these of extended hedges. The fragmentation of hedgerows prevents the development of characteristic ground beetle associations by supporting the immigration of open habitat species, which profit from edge effects. Finally the weak points of the ecological parameters will be critically compared and discussed.

In the Mediterranean Sea, habitat preferences of small benthic fishes of shallow waters have been poorly investigated. Although combtooth blennies are not of interest for fisheries, they are often the dominant fish community on rocky bottoms within the first meter of depth and in tidal pool environments, playing so an important role in the functioning of the coastal ecosystem. This study represents the first detailed investigation concerning habitat preference and depth distribution of combtooth blennies in the Ionian Sea. Materials and methods. Occurrence and abundance of species were investigated by a non-destructive visual census method using snorkelling or SCUBA diving. We investigated 5 habitat types (bathymetric intervals between 0 and 3 m of depth) to find difference in species richness and abundance in each one and between. Studies were conducted from June to October 2014 in the south-eastern coast of Sicily. Statistical method of the electivity index (EI) and principal component analysis (PCA) were utilized for the evaluation of the habitat preference of 11 species of combtooth blennies. Depth distribution for each species was box-plotted. For each habitat and depth, the Shannon-Wiener Index (H') and the Simpson Index (D) were calculated. Diversity profiles were performed in order to give a better understanding of the correlation between diversity and both habitat types and depth. Results. During a total of 2485 observations of combtooth blennies a total of 11 species were recorded: Aidablennius sphynx (Valenciennes, 1836); Coryphoblennius galerita (Linnaeus, 1758); Lipophrys trigloides (Valenciennes, 1836); Microlipophrys canevae (Vinciguerra, 1880); Parablennius gattorugine (Linnaeus, 1758); Parablennius incognitus (Bath, 1968); Parablennius pilicornis (Cuvier, 1829); Parablennius sanguinolentus (Pallas, 1814); Parablennius zvonimiri (Kolombatovic, 1892); Salaria pavo (Risso, 1810); Scartella cristata (Linnaeus, 1758). The maximum Shannon-Wiener Index (H'= 2.335) and Simpson Index (D = 0.898) values were recorded on "rocks with algal cover"; while, concerning the depth, the maximum values of both indices were recorded within the first meter. The diversity indices showed the highest values in the most heterogeneous habitat types. There was a negative correlation between depth and diversity indices. Results showed a clear habitat preference for the following species: A. sphynx, P. gattorugine, P. sanguinolentus, S. pavo and S. cristata. Conclusion. This study highlights the importance of depth and habitat heterogeneity in biological diversity, species richness and population abundances of combtooth blennies in the Mediterranean Sea.

A total of five orders, 21 families, 45 genera and 121 species of fish were recorded with Perciformes (78.5%) being the most diverse. The highest number (5) of dominant species was found near Chenhang Island while the lowest (2) number was detected at Zhubi Reef. The highest abundance index (7.21) occurred at Zhubi Reef, while the Shannon-Wiener diversity (4.80), Pielou's evenness (0.81), and Simpson's dominance (0.95) indexes were all highest at Qiliangyu Island. Based on cluster analysis and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS), fish communities varied more spatially than seasonally. Our results led us to hypothesize that the habitat complexity and level of anthropogenic disturbance were the main factors affecting the composition of reef-dwelling fish on each coral reef. Topography was likely responsible for most variation in the spatial pattern of fish diversity.

To this end, 20 dogs and 20 Domestic shorthair cats were fed a commercially available adult dog food, or cat food, respectively, with either syrup containing GOS (at 1% w galacto-oligosaccharides/w formulated feed) on top (test group) or no topping (control group) for 56 days in a cross-over design. The study consisted of 2 periods of 24 days adaptation, followed by 4 days of collection of faeces. Faecal samples were tested for moisture, nitrogen, pH, macronutrients, enzymes, and fermentation products. The faecal microbiota were analysed by 16S rDNA profiling. It appeared that GOS have different effects in dogs compared to cats. In dogs, the addition of GOS resulted in increased carbohydrate fermentation (increase of acetic and butyric acid), whereas in cats GOS resulted in increased amino acid fermentation (increase of isovaleric acid). The alpha-diversity of the canine faecal microbiota was reduced by dietary GOS (Inverse Simpson Index, p = 0.063; Shannon index, p = 0.035) whereas the alpha-diversity of cat faecal microbiota was unaffected (Inverse Simpson Index, p = 0.539; Shannon index, p = 0.872). Lachnospiraceae spp. and Bifidobacterium spp. positively responded to GOS in both cats and dogs. Lactobacillus spp. and Enterobacteriaceae spp. positively responded to GOS in dogs. In both dogs and cats, GOS may therefore improve stool microbiota and result in the production of specific metabolites that are beneficial to gut health.																			0034-5288	1532-2661				FEB	2024	167								105116	10.1016/j.rvsc.2023.105116	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2023.105116		DEC 2023						38160491					WOS:001153179800001

However, conventional between food group scores fail to capture the nutritional variability and ecosystem services delivered by dietary richness and dissimilarity within food groups, or the relative distribution (i.e., evenness or moderation) of e.g., species or varieties across whole diets. Summarizing food biodiversity in an all-encompassing index is problematic. Therefore, various diversity indices have been proposed in ecology, yet these require methodological adaption for integration in dietary assessments. In this narrative review, we summarize the key conceptual issues underlying the measurement of food biodiversity at an edible species level, assess the ecological diversity indices previously applied to food consumption and food supply data, discuss their relative suitability, and potential amendments for use in (quantitative) dietary intake studies. Ecological diversity indices are often used without justification through the lens of nutrition. To illustrate: (i) dietary species richness fails to account for the distribution of foods across the diet or their functional traits; (ii) evenness indices, such as the Gini-Simpson index, require widely accepted relative abundance units (e.g., kcal, g, cups) and evidence-based moderation weighting factors; and (iii) functional dissimilarity indices are constructed based on an arbitrary selection of distance measures, cutoff criteria, and number of phylogenetic, nutritional, and morphological traits. Disregard for these limitations can lead to counterintuitive results and ambiguous or incorrect conclusions about the food biodiversity within diets or food systems. To ensure comparability and robustness of future research, we advocate food biodiversity indices that: (i) satisfy key axioms; (ii) can be extended to account for disparity between edible species; and (iii) are used in combination, rather than in isolation.

Diversity of freshwater ascomycetes in freshwater bodies at Amphoe Mae Chan, Chiang Rai	CRYPTOGAMIE MYCOLOGIE												The diversity of freshwater fungi on submerged wood has been documented in three water resources of Mae Chan, Chiang Rai, Thailand. Sixty samples were collected from each site and examined for fungi. In total, 60 fungal taxa were identified including 29 ascomycetes, 27 anamorphic taxa and 4 unidentified species. The data obtained from the three sites were then used to calculate frequency of occurrence, species richness, Margalef index, Simpson's index (D), Shannon-Weiner index (H') and species evenness (E). The fungal diversity from Site 2 (waterfall with abundant trees) was higher than that from Site 1 (river near agricultural zone) and Site 3 (waterfall with scrub). Interestingly, Acrogenospora sphaerocephala, Canalisporium caribense, Corynesporium sp., Didymella aptrootii, Fluminicola bipolaris, Halosarphaeia aquadulcis, Helicomyces roseus and Savoryella lignicola were frequently recorded in all sites. This paper is the first report to provide new data concerning the distribution of freshwater fungi in northern Thailand. The relationship between fungal diversity and freshwater habitats is also discussed.

J	Peterson, CJ				Peterson, Chris J.			Damage Diversity as a Metric of Structural Complexity after Forest Wind Disturbance	FORESTS												This study presents a new metric for quantifying structural complexity using the diversity of tree damage types in forests that have experienced wind disturbance. Structural complexity studies of forests have to date not incorporated any protocol to address the variety of structural damage types experienced by trees in wind disturbances. This study describes and demonstrates such a protocol. Damage diversity, defined as the richness and evenness of types of tree damage, is calculated analogously to species diversity using two common indices, and termed a Shannon Damage Heterogeneity Index' (Sh-DHI) and an inverse Simpson Damage Heterogeneity Index (iSi-DHI). The two versions of the DHI are presented for >400 plots across 18 distinct wind disturbed forests of eastern North America. Relationships between DHI and pre-disturbance forest species diversity and size variability, as well as wind disturbance severity, calculated as the fraction of basal area downed in a wind disturbance event, are examined. DHIs are only weakly related to pre-disturbance tree species diversity, but are significantly positively related to pre-disturbance tree size inequality (size diversity). Damage diversity exhibits a robust curvilinear relationship to severity; both versions of the DHI show peaks at intermediate levels of wind disturbance severity, suggesting that in turn structural complexity may also peak at intermediate levels of severity.																			1999-4907					FEB	2019	10	2							85	10.3390/f10020085	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/f10020085													WOS:000460744000009
J	Lalande, J; Villemur, R; Deschênes, L				Lalande, Jonathan; Villemur, Richard; Deschenes, Louise			A New Framework to Accurately Quantify Soil Bacterial Community Diversity from DGGE	MICROBIAL ECOLOGY												Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) has been and remains extensively used to assess and monitor the effects of various treatments on soil bacterial communities. Considering only abundant phylotypes, the diversity estimates produced by this technique have been proven to be uncorrelated to true community diversity. The aim of this paper was to develop a framework to estimate a community's true diversity from DGGE. Developed using in silico DGGE profiles generated from published pyrosequencing datasets, this framework elongates the rank-abundance distributions (RADs) drawn by band quantification using the peak-to-signal ratio (PSR) parameter, which was proven to be related to bacterial richness. The ability to compare DGGE-based diversity estimates to the true diversity of communities led to a unique opportunity to identify potential pitfalls when analyzing DGGE gels with commercial analysis software programs and gain insight into the process of DNA band clustering in the profiles. Bacterial diversity was compared through richness, Shannon, and Simpson's 1/D indices. Intermediate results demonstrated that, even though commercial gel analysis software programs were unable to produce consistent results throughout all samples, a newly developed Matlab-based framework unraveled the dominance profiles of communities from band quantification. Elongating these partial RADs using the PSRs extracted from the DGGE profiles chiefly made it possible to accurately estimate the true diversity of communities. For all the samples analyzed, the estimated Shannon and Simpson's 1/D were accurate at +/- 10 %. Richness estimations were less accurate, ranging from -11 to 31 % of the expected values. The framework showed great potential to study the structure and diversity of soil bacterial communities.

Tree species diversity, distribution and population structure in a tropical dry deciduous forest of Malyagiri hill ranges, Eastern Ghats, India	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Tree species diversity, distribution and population structure of tropical forests of Eastern Ghats are poorly understood. We analyzed the structure of a tropical deciduous forest in Malyagiri hill ranges of Eastern Ghats, Odisha. The study was conducted by laying 60 quadrats, each 20 m x 20 m in size. In total, 1063 trees belonging to 57 species were recorded from 2.4 ha samplipng area. Mean density was 443 trees ha(-1) and basal area was 13.73 m(2) ha-1. The dominant tree species was Shorea robusta with an Importance Value Index (IVI) of 44.67. Other important species were Terminalia alata (IVI 31.98), Madhuca indica (17.3), Anogeissus latifolia (15.64) and Diospyros melanoxylon (13.41). Stem density and species richness decreased with increasing girth class of trees. The Shannon-Wiener index (H') was 3.38 and Simpson's index (C) 1.0 indicating high tree species diversity in the present tropical deciduous forest. Out of 57 species, five species were randomly and fifty two species contagiously distributed. Tree species diversity, distribution and population structure provide baseline information for conservation and management of the present forest.

High sulfate reducing diversity was confirmed through the 93 and 78 TRFs found using Sau3A1 and Taq alpha 1 restriction enzymes. Statistical analysis using Simpson (D) and Shannon (H') diversity index and principal coordinate analysis revealed differential distribution of SRB at each treatment stage and between waste and sediment samples. Inversely to the distribution of purple phototrophic bacteria, the diversity of SRB decreased within sediment and increased within the water phase downstream of the plant.

J	Li, JN; Peng, PQ; Zhao, J				Li, Jiangnan; Peng, Peiqin; Zhao, Jie			Assessment of soil nematode diversity based on different taxonomic levels and functional groups	SOIL ECOLOGY LETTERS												Although soil nematode diversity has been used as an indicator of habitat characteristics and environmental change, the diversity of entire soil nematode communities has not been comprehensively evaluated at different taxonomic levels, or for different functional groups, or at a fine taxonomic level within functional groups. In this study, two taxonomic diversity indices, the Shannon-Wiener index (H ') and Simpson index (lambda), were used to evaluate the following: 1) nematode diversity at different taxonomic levels for the whole community, 2) nematode diversity of different functional groups, and 3) nematode generic diversity of functional groups in the following four land-use types: forage land, cropland, secondary forest, and grass-shrubland. The results showed that significant differences in nematode diversity among land-use types were detected by assessment at the order level but not at the family or genus level. The results also showed that significant differences in nematode diversity were better revealed by assessment of trophic groups rather than cp groups. The generic diversities (H ' )of omnivorous nematodes and cp3 nematodes also significantly differed among land-use types. Our results indicate that diversity at a high taxonomic level (i.e., order) may be a more useful indicator than diversity at a low taxonomic level (i.e., family or genus) of differences among land-use types. In addition, the functional group diversity (i.e., trophic group, cp group, and the combination of these two groups) for the whole community and the taxonomic diversity within functional groups were useful indicators of differences among land-use types.																			2662-2289	2662-2297				MAR	2020	2	1					33	39		10.1007/s42832-019-0019-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42832-019-0019-5													WOS:000671269500006

I will review several major options and then present a comprehensive formalism in which all these can be embedded as special cases, depending on the setting of two parameters, labelled degree and order. This mathematical framework is adapted from generalized information theory. A discussion of the theoretical meaning of the parameters in biological applications provides insight into the conceptual features and limitations of current approaches. The unified framework described also allows for the development of a tailored solution for the measurement of biological diversity that jointly satisfies otherwise divergent desiderata put forward in the literature.

Methods: Anthropometry, Triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, HOMA-IR, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP) were evaluated (and z-score calculated) and faecal samples were collected from 191 children with obesity aged from 8 to 14. All children were classified depending on their cardiometabolic status in either a "metabolically healthy" (MHO; n = 106) or "metabolically unhealthy" (MUO; n = 85) group. Differences in gut microbiota taxonomies and diversity between groups (MUO vs MHO) were analysed. Alpha diversity index was calculated as Chao1 and Simpson's index, and b-diversity was calculated as Adonis Bray-Curtis index. Spearman's correlations and logistic regressions were performed to study the association between cardiometabolic health and the microbiota. Results: Children in the MUO presented significantly lower alpha diversity and richness than those in the MHO group (Chao1 index p = 0.021, Simpson's index p = 0.045, respectively), whereas microbiota bdiversity did not differ by the cardiometabolic health status (Adonis Bray-Curtis, R2 = 0.006; p = 0.155). The MUO group was characterized by lower relative abundances of the genera Christensenellaceae R7 group (MHO:1.42% [0.21-2.94]; MUO:0.47% [0.02-1.60], p < 0.004), and Akkermansia (MHO:0.26% [0.01 -2.19]; MUO:0.01% [0.00-0.36], p < 0.001) and higher relative abundances of Bacteroides (MHO:10.6% [4.64-18.5]; MUO:17.0% [7.18-27.4], p = 0.012) genus. After the adjustment by sex, age, and BMI, higher Akkermansia (OR: 0.86, CI: 0.75-0.97; p = 0.033), Christensenellaceae R7 group (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 075 -0.98; p = 0.031) and Chao1 index (OR: 0.86, CI: 0.96-1.00; p = 0.023) represented a lower risk of the presence of one or more altered cardiovascular risk factors. Conclusion: Lower proportions of Christensenellaceae and Akkermansia and lower diversity and richness seem to be indicators of a metabolic unhealthy status in children with obesity.

Water hyacinth is a typical example of inland species, an invasive aquatic plant that can drastically alter the natural plant community's floral diversity. The present study aims to assess the impact of water hyacinth biomass on the floristic characteristics of aquatic plants in the Merbil wetland of the Brahmaputra floodplain, NE, India. Using a systematic sampling technique, data were collected from the field at regular intervals for one year (2021) to estimate monthly water hyacinth biomass. The total estimate of the wetland's biomass was made using the Kriging interpolation technique. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), Simpson's diversity index (D), dominance and evenness or equitability index (E), density, and frequency were used to estimate the floristic characteristics of aquatic plants in the wetland. The result shows that the highest biomass was recorded in September (408.1 tons/ha), while the lowest was recorded in March (38 tons/ha). The floristic composition of aquatic plants was significantly influenced by water hyacinth biomass. A total of forty-one plant species from 23 different families were found in this tiny freshwater marsh during the floristic survey. Out of the total, 25 species were emergent, 11 were floating leaves, and the remaining five were free-floating habitats. Eichhornia crassipes was the wetland's most dominant plant. A negative correlation was observed between water hyacinth biomass and the Shannon (H) index, Simpson diversity index, and evenness. We observed that water hyacinths had changed the plant community structure of freshwater habitats in the study area. Water hyacinth's rapid expansion blocked out sunlight, reducing the ecosystem's productivity and ultimately leading to species loss. The study will help devise plans for the sustainable management of natural resources and provide helpful guidance for maintaining the short-to the medium-term ecological balance in similar wetlands.

Two samples were collected in summer, autumn and spring, with one replicate in each river. The total of 28,961 specimens included members of Platyhelminthes, Annelida, Acarina, Insecta, Crustacea and Mollusca. The Silvelra and Marco rivers showed significant differences in the indices of Shannon-Weaver (HI, Simpson's Reciprocal (1/D), Margalef (DMg) and Equitability (E). The Silveira River showed the highest means of diversity and the EPT index (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera). Comparison among the diversity indices, considered individually, were insufficient to show differences in community structure, for the purpose of ecological characterization of the rivers. The EPT values characterized the Divisa River as having the highest abundance (73%), followed by the Marco (71%), Antas (48%) and Silveira (36%).

Samples were collected in the Southern region of Santa Catarina, involving three municipalities: Orleans, Lauro Muller, and Sideropolis, in the land use systems (LUS) of native forest (NF), Eucalyptus plantation (EP), pasture (PA), integrated crop-livestock (ICL), and no-tillage (NT). Soil samples to determine edaphic properties and pitfall traps were collected in winter and summer, in the same areas. The collected springtails were counted and morphotyped and the data were analyzed through abundance, Shannon-Wiener diversity (H') and Margalef index, Simpson dominance index (D), Pielou evenness index (J), morphotype richness, and Principal Components Analysis (PCA). Springtails morphotypes were influenced by the management conditions of each system, especially the impact of LUS on these organisms depends on the intensity of the forest/agricultural practices used, including crop rotation and soil preparation.

With this aim, a total of eight biotic and three species diversity indices were used to determine water quality of Kozluoluk Stream in West Anatolia of Turkey. The biotic indices were: Saprobi (SI), Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP-O, BMWP-S and BMWP-G), Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), Family Biotic Index (FBI), Belgian Biotic Index (BBI), EPT-Taxa [%], and species diversity indices consisted of: Shannon-Weaver (SWDI), Simpsons (SDI) and Margalef (MDI). Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to the physicochemical and biotic dataset. Similarities between the sampling stations were clustered by using cluster analysis (CLUS). Pearson-based correlations were used to determine which index is more suitable in determining water quality of the stream. The nine taxonomic groups were found in Kozluoluk Stream consisting of Amphipoda, Oligochaeta, Gastropoda, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera, Odonata, Coleoptera and Diptera. The 1st and 2nd stations (90%) were the most similar stations in terms of benthic macroinvertebrate species distribution. The results indicate that the ASPT, BBI, BMWP-O, BMWP-S, BMWP-G and EPT-Taxa [%] are more proper than FBI and SI indices to determine the water quality of Kozluoluk Stream. The water quality along the stream varied from good class in upstream stations, to moderate in downstream stations. This study clearly showed that the specific biotic index according to the ecological characteristics of Turkey should be developed.

Simple statistical models such as linear regressions are most used approach that has been used by researchers. Applying other regression types in forest attribute estimations and their spatial modeling using decision tree analysis such as regression tree may be more usefulness compare to linear regression. In a case study in the Hyrcanian forests, northern of Iran, the capability of linear and regression tree analyses were compared to estimation of stand volume, tree density and tree diversity. Stepwise multiple regression and regression tree analyses were conducted to evaluate relationships between forest characteristics as dependent and ETM+ bands and vegetation indices as independent variables. Performance assessment of models was examined using RMSE and Bias on the unused validation plots. The results of analysis showed that statistical models of stand volume, tree density, species richness and reciprocal of Simpson indices using tree regression analysis had higher adjusted R2 and CE compare to linear regression models. In addition, the performance results showed that RMSE of models using tree regression were 88.7 m3/ha, 157n/ha, 1.15 and 0.61 respectively for stand volume, tree density, species richness and Simpson index, Whereas, the RMSE of obtained models using linear regression were computed about 97m3/ha, 170n/ha, 1.51 and 1.15, respectively.

However, there are no studies on the direct differences in microbial community composition between disease-susceptible and healthy walnut leaves. This study collected five samples of healthy and infected leaves (all leaves with abnormal spots were considered diseased leaves) from May to October 2018. Differences in fungal diversity (Chao1 index, Shannon index, and Simpson index) and community structure were observed by sequencing and analyzing diseased and healthy leaf microbial communities by Illumina HiSeq sequencing technology. The main fungal phyla of walnut leaf-associated were Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, and Glomeromycota. Diversity indices (Shannon and Chao1 index values) of healthy leaves differed significantly in the late stages of disease onset. The results showed that the fungal species that differed considerably between the healthy and infected groups differed, and the fungal species that differed significantly between the healthy and infected groups changed with the development of the leaf disease. Critical control time points were determined by analyzing the population dynamics of pathogenic fungi. Leaf-associated microorganisms are abundant and diverse, and fungal identification and diversity studies are helpful for developing more appropriate walnut management strategies [GRAPHICS]																			1733-1331	2544-4646				SEP 24	2022	71	3					429	441		10.33073/pjm-2022-038	http://dx.doi.org/10.33073/pjm-2022-038								36185023					WOS:000863412900010

The Simpson diversity (D) and equitability index (J') were calculated using survey data on number of stems (greater than or equal to 4.5 cm DBH) of each species found in sample plots. Near-climax old forests (age greater than or equal to 50 yr, without pine trees) showed high species diversity of trees, 0.92 +/- 0.01 in D and 0.83 +/- 0.05 in J' for trees of which DBH greater than or equal to 4.5 cm, and 0.81 +/- 0.04 in D and 0.75 +/- 0.05 in J' for trees of DBH greater than or equal to 10 cm. These high values are comparable to those of tropical rain forests. Although even young forests showed high species diversity, diversity indices tended to increase with forest age. The U.S. Marine Corps leases the eastern half of Yanbaru which contains most of these near-climax forests. Conservation of natural forests in this area is recommended.																			1385-0237	1573-5052				DEC	1997	133	2					125	133		10.1023/A:1009748016272	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009748016272													WOS:000071505700002

According to the current legislation, roadside borders should be considered as permanent preservation areas. However, there are few studies that aim to evaluate the real conservationist potential of these protection areas. We sampled 40 plots of 50 x 10 m, arranged randomly at the edge of highways, and sampled all living tree individuals with circumference at 30 cm from the ground greater or equal to 15 cm. The phytosociological parameters of relative density, dominance and frequency, importance value, Pielou equability and the diversity indices of Shannon-Weaver and Simpson were calculated. The richness was estimated using Jackknife 2, Bootstrap and Mao Tao indices. We sampled 790 individuals belonging to 88 species and 35 families, with a high diversity index of 3.64 for Shannon-Weaver, 0.94 for Simpson, and 0.81 for equability. The most representative species were Dalbergia miscolobium, Piptocarpha rotundifolia, Machaerium acutifolium, Ouratea hexasperma and Stenocalyx dysentericus. The families with the highest number of species were Fabaceae (20 species), Myrtaceae (8 species) and Bignoniaceae (7 species). The estimated richness was 108 by the Bootstrap estimator and 159 by the Jacknife 2 estimator, demonstrating that the number of species at the roadsides tends to be greater than those found in some protected Cerrado areas. Based on our results, we can infer that the roadside borders are important to conservation, harboring a great amount of the Cerrado tree flora, which justifies their protection by law and recommends their maintenance, given the current intensive degradation of the Cerrado biome.

This trend has been faced without effective policies and programs. Consequently, a great opportunity has been transformed in a great threat and the word immigration is generally associated with the term social security. In less than one century, Italy has been transformed from a country originating great migration flows to a country which is the destination of migration flows. The aim of this paper is to examine foreign immigration in Italy distinguishing according to nationality of foreigners. In order to analyze this phenomenon Shannon and Simpson Diversity Indices to measure the level of entropy in a distribution and the variation in categorical data have been used. The spatial dimension of migration flows has been analyzed in this paper using Spatial Autocorrelation techniques and more particularly Local Indicators of Spatial Association in order to analyze the highest values of a foreigner group considering the relationship with the surrounding municipalities.

These forests provide several ecosystems services to the mankind and have very high ethnomedicinal values. The present work was conducted in tropical dry deciduous forest of Jashpur, a tribe dominating district of Chhattisgarh. Plant diversity has been studied at six different sites out of which three were heavily disturbed whereas three were moderately disturbed. At these sites dominance and distribution patterns of tree species, tree density (stems ha(-1)), relative dominance, importance value index and diversity indices (species richness, species equitability, evenness, Simpson's index, Shannon-Weiner index, beta diversity, disturbance index) were calculated. These plants are being widely used by tribal as medicines, and hence, documentation of ethnomedicinal wisdom of tribal people was also done. Information Consensus Factor (ICF) and Fidelity Levels (FL) were also calculated to know the therapeutic uses by the local communities of the region. Present work has documented the ethnomedicianl knowledge that can be used by government agencies in preparation of Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) to protect Indian traditional medicinal knowledge and prevent its misappropriation at International Patent Offices. In addition, the results of the study may be helpful for developing policies for the conservation of these forests to sustain their ecosystem services to the mankind.

J	Heiser, M; Dapporto, L; Schmitt, T				Heiser, Markus; Dapporto, Leonardo; Schmitt, Thomas			Coupling impoverishment analysis and partitioning of beta diversity allows a comprehensive description of Odonata biogeography in the Western Mediterranean	ORGANISMS DIVERSITY & EVOLUTION												Islands host a subset of organisms occurring at their sources, and these assemblages are usually dominated by the most generalistic and dispersive species. In this study, we aim to identify which species are missing on islands and which ecological traits are responsible for differential occurrence. Then, we apply this information to beta diversity analyses. As a study group and area, we selected the Odonata in the Western Mediterranean. Based on the presence/absence of 109 species, we applied a series of analyses at both community and individual species level. The islands of the Balearics, Corsica, Sardinia and Malta are highly impoverished, but Sicily is not. Non-parametric multivariate adaptive regression splines predicted the occurrence of individual species on each island. Principal component analysis recognised differences between damselflies (Zygoptera) and dragonflies (Anisoptera), but members of the two suborders have similar occurrences on islands, and island occurrence is determined mostly by species' frequencies at source and by their degree of generalism. Island species predicted correctly to occur on islands showed opposite characteristics to species unpredicted to occur and being present. The similarity pattern highlighted by turnover (Simpson index) is clearer than that obtained by non-partitioned beta diversity (Sorensen index). In fact, indicator value analyses revealed more indicator species for the Simpson compared to Sorensen index, and indicator species from islands where unpredicted to occur by impoverishment analysis. This suggests that island species predicted absent determine most of an island's turnover pattern, thus encompassing fundamental biogeographic information. Due to their absence on nearest sources, they are also at higher risk of extinction, and deserving of special conservation effort.

J	Zhang, QP; Wang, J; Wang, Q				Zhang, Qi-peng; Wang, Jian; Wang, Qian			Effects of abiotic factors on plant diversity and species distribution of alpine meadow plants	ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS												The alpine meadow is a type of vegetation with significant ecological and economic values. Plant diversity and species distribution are affected by ecological environment. To study the influence of abiotic factors (topographic factors and soil chemical and physical properties), it can understand plant communities? formation and the adaptation of plants to abiotic factors. Here, we explored the influence of the abiotic factors on the plant diversity and species distribution through the investigation of alpine meadow vegetation and abiotic factors at the northeast Tibetan Plateau, the results of the laboratory experiments, and the representative difference analysis (RDA) to find the ordination differences. Our results revealed that 11 ordered abiotic factors explained the 25.5% of the distribution of the alpine meadow species. The slope, soil total nitrogen (STN), and soil organic matter (SOM) have a significant influence on the distribution of the alpine meadow species. According to the RDA analysis of the correlation between plant diversity and abiotic factors, the cumulative interpretation value of the four ordination axes was 39.0%. Slope and STN has a strong correlation with plant diversity, respectively. STN, soil total phosphorus (STP), soil total potassium (STK), and soil water content (SWC) has positive relationships with the plant diversity index, respectively, suggesting that those factors above mentioned are the main factors affecting the diversity of species in alpine meadows. Slope, aspect, and soil temperature (ST) has negative relationships with the Partrick index, Simpson?s diversity index, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index, indicating that with the slope increases, the plant diversity decreases, and the plant diversity also decrease at the sunward aspect. The soil has a more significant impact on the Pielou?s evenness index, but the topography has a weaker influence on the Pielou?s evenness index. The plant diversity and species distribution of alpine meadow in Tibet Plateau are affected by many abiotic factors. In our study, we found that slope and STN were the main factors affecting the plant diversity and species distribution in alpine meadows.																			1574-9541	1878-0512				2021 MAR	2021	61								101210	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101210	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101210		JAN 2021											WOS:000632605400004
J	Parré, JL; Chagas, ALS				Parre, Jose Luiz; Chagas, Andre Luis Squarize			Determinants of agricultural diversification in Brazil: a spatial econometric analysis	LETTERS IN SPATIAL AND RESOURCE SCIENCES												This research has as main objective to analyze the behavior and the importance of agricultural diversification for Brazil, considering its States, for the period from 2002 to 2018. We will propose an analytical model to make it possible to identify the determinants of agricultural diversification in Brazil. Empirically, the study estimates an SLX model using panel data and considers the spillover effects, highlighting the importance of location and neighborhood. The study's findings indicate a continued decline in crop diversity with a strong tendency to productive specialization in Brazilian agriculture, mainly in the states located in the Midwest and South regions of the country. The average growth rates of the indices presented negative values for the analysis period: - 0.41% per year for the Simpson index, - 0.58% per year for the Shannon index, and - 0.91% per year for the effective number of crops.

Our aim was to compare the vaginal and urinary microbiomes between premenopausal women with ICBPS and unaffected controls. This cross-sectional study screened premenopausal women with an O'Leary-Sant questionnaire (ICBPS if score >= 6 on either index; controls <6 on both). Women completed questionnaires on health characteristics, pelvic floor symptoms (OABq, PFDI-20), body image (mBIS), and sexual function (PISQ-IR). Bacterial genomic DNA was isolated from vaginal and clean-catch urinary specimens; the bacterial 16 rRNA gene was sequenced and analyzed using the QIIME pipeline. We performed UniFrac analysis (beta-diversity) and generated Chao1 estimator (richness) and Simpson index (richness and evenness) values. We analyzed 23 ICBPS and 18 non-ICBPS patients. ICBPS patients had increased vaginal deliveries, BMI, and public insurance as well as worsened OAB-q, PFDI-20, mBIS, and PISQ-IR domain scores. Lactobacilli was the most abundant genus in both cohorts, and anaerobic or fastidious predominance was similar between groups (p = 0.99). For both the urine and vagina specimens, Chao1 and Simpson indices were similar between ICBPS and unaffected women. Weighted and unweighted UniFrac analyses showed no differences between groups. A significant correlation existed between the urinary and vaginal Simpson indices in ICBPS women, but not in unaffected women. Premenopausal women with ICBPS, despite worsened socioeconomic indicators and pelvic floor function, were not found to have significantly different urinary and vaginal microbiomes compared to women without ICBPS.

J	Srivastava, A; Verma, D				Srivastava, Ankita; Verma, Digvijay			Ganga River sediments of India predominate with aerobic and chemo-heterotrophic bacteria majorly engaged in the degradation of xenobiotic compounds	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH												Sediment provides a stagnant habitat to microbes that accumulate organic matter and other industrial pollutants from the upper layer of the water. The sediment of the Ganga River of India is overlooked for exploring the bacterial diversity despite their taxon richness over the water counterpart. To enrich the limited information on the bacterial diversity of the Ganga River sediment, the present study was planned that relies on amplicon-based bacterial diversity of the Ganga River sediment by using bacterial-specific 16S hypervariable region (V-3-V-4). The Illumina MiSeq2500 platform generated 1,769,226 raw reads from the metagenomes of various samples obtained from ten sites in five major cities of Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand regions traversing the Ganga River. Taxonomy level analysis assigned 58 phyla, 366 order, and 715 genera of bacterial type. The high values of various diversity indices (Chao1, Shannon, and Simpson) in Kanpur sediment indicate the high bacterial richness compared to the Rishikesh sediment. However, several other ecological parameters (Shannon index, Simpson index, enspie_vector, and Faith_pd) were comparatively higher in Rishikesh sediment which is a comparatively less disturbed region by human activities over the other sediments samples studied here. Ganga River sediment dominates with Gram-negative, chemo-heterotrophic, and aerobic bacteria that chiefly belong to Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Bacteroidota. The abundance of Nitrospira, Hydrogenophaga, Thauera, Vicinamibacteraceae, and Latescibacterota in the Ganga River sediment could be considered as the ecological indicators that find a significant role in the degradation of xenobiotic compounds. The PICRUSt-based analysis showed that similar to 35% of genes were involved in benzoate and aminobenzoate degradation where a significant portion of genes belong to nitrotoluene degradation (14%). Thus, the study uncovers a new perspective in the lineage of bacterial communities and their functional characterization of the Ganga River sediment.

The objective was to characterize the structure, diversity, and endemism in the relict montane forest of Los Lanches ,Las Palmas in the district of Conchan, Chota, Cajamarca, Peru. Seven 1,000 m(2) plots were evaluated for its tree composition and 100 m(2) and 25 m(2) plots for natural regeneration. The horizontal distribution reflects an inverted "J". Weinmannia elliptica (16,63 %) and Hedysomum scabrum (10,27 %) showed high importance value indices. Twenty percent of species persist in the three strata. Of the natural regeneration, the most important species are Hedyosmum scabrum (27,79 %) and Palicourea ame-thystina (14,77 %). The species with the highest importance value were Hedyosmum scabrum (19,24 %) and Weinmannia elliptica (11,44 %). The most abundant families were Lauraceae with four species, and Myrtaceae and Melastomataceae with three species. A mixing coefficient of 0,033 was obtained, Simpson's index (0,89) indicated high diversity, as did the Shannon-Wiener index (2,68). Brachyotum coronatum and Cyathea caracasana are in a vulnerable state. Axinaea nitida is in a state of minor concern and Ocotea jumbillensis is endangered.																			2221-5948	2222-7431					2021	9	1					43	58		10.22386/ca.v9i1.319	http://dx.doi.org/10.22386/ca.v9i1.319													WOS:000734891600004

We suggest that the skin microbiome might be changed during the progression of melanoma. The aim of this study is to compare the composition of the skin microbiota between different locations (skin and melanoma) of a MeLiM (Melanoma-bearing Libechov Minipig) pig model (exophytic melanoma). Ninety samples were used for PCR-DGGE analysis with primers specifically targeting the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The profiles were used for cluster analysis by UPGMA and principal coordinate analysis PCoA and also to calculate the diversity index (Simpson index of diversity). By comparing the obtained results, we found that both bacterial composition and diversity were significantly different between the skin and melanoma microbiomes. The abundances of Fusobacterium and Trueperella genera were significantly increased in melanoma samples, suggesting a strong relationship between melanoma development and skin microbiome changes.

J	Casquilho, JP; Rego, FC				Casquilho, Jose Pinto; Rego, Francisco Castro			Discussing Landscape Compositional Scenarios Generated with Maximization of Non-Expected Utility Decision Models Based on Weighted Entropies	ENTROPY												The search for hypothetical optimal solutions of landscape composition is a major issue in landscape planning and it can be outlined in a two-dimensional decision space involving economic value and landscape diversity, the latter being considered as a potential safeguard to the provision of services and externalities not accounted in the economic value. In this paper, we use decision models with different utility valuations combined with weighted entropies respectively incorporating rarity factors associated to Gini-Simpson and Shannon measures. A small example of this framework is provided and discussed for landscape compositional scenarios in the region of Nisa, Portugal. The optimal solutions relative to the different cases considered are assessed in the two-dimensional decision space using a benchmark indicator. The results indicate that the likely best combination is achieved by the solution using Shannon weighted entropy and a square root utility function, corresponding to a risk-averse behavior associated to the precautionary principle linked to safeguarding landscape diversity, anchoring for ecosystem services provision and other externalities. Further developments are suggested, mainly those relative to the hypothesis that the decision models here outlined could be used to revisit the stability-complexity debate in the field of ecological studies.

Omar; Kucukbasmaci, Ibrahim			Using macroinvertebrate-based biotic indices and diversity indices to assess water quality: A case study on the Karasu Stream (Kastamonu, Türkiye)	ECOHYDROLOGY												Biomonitoring is an approach that uses indicators or sentinel species to assess the health or pollution of an environment, combining diversity based on specific taxonomic groups with the taxa's indicator of pollution into a single index or score. Benthic macroinvertebrates are among the most preferred and valuable indicators of the biotic index. Our study aims to evaluate water quality and ecological status using biotic and diversity indices based on benthic macroinvertebrates. The macroinvertebrate samples used in this study were collected seasonally from 16 stations determined in Karasu Stream. These samples consist of 14,747 specimens belonging to 9 orders and 40 families of Insecta, Malacostraca, Hirudinea and Oligochaeta. In addition, some physicochemical parameters were measured at the stations. The data obtained were analysed using the Turkey-Biological Monitoring Working Group (TR-BMWP), Average Score per Taxon (ASPT), Family Biotic Index (FBI), Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) taxon richness index, and Shannon-Wiener, Simpson and Hill's diversity indices. Our results showed that the last six stations of Karasu Stream were under pressure due to various anthropogenic effects. According to biotic indexes, the ecological quality status of the water in the stations was determined to be high or good in the first 10 stations and average, poor or bad in the last 6 stations. The results of our study showed that TR-BMWP, FBI and EPT indices are more reliable in determining water quality than the ASPT index and reflect the environmental situation better. Since the TR-BMWP index is adapted to macroinvertebrate taxa distributed in Turkiye, it can be used as a suitable tool for evaluating other rivers' water quality in Turkiye.

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Plant domestication is an evolutionary process guided by human groups who modify the landscape for their needs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the phenotypic variations between populations of Spondias tuberosa Arruda (umbuzeiro) when subjected to different local landscape management strategies. The influence of the landscape management system on these populations was evaluated in five identified regional units (mountains, base of mountains, pastures, cultivated areas and home gardens). Ten individuals were randomly selected from each region and subjected to morphological and chemical fruit analysis. The diversity index, based on Simpson's index, was determined for the different populations. We then evaluated the morphological differences between the individual fruits from the distinct landscape areas. We observed no significant differences in morphological diversity between the areas studied. Our data suggest that the umbuzeiro specimens in this region may be in the process of incipient domestication.

COMPARISON BETWEEN THE LINEAR MODEL AND K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR METHOD FOR PREDICTING MACROINVERTEBRATE ASSEMBLES IN A CITY RIVER IN BEIJING, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Benthic macroinvertebrates play an important role in materials and energy flow in river ecosystems. In this paper, we built models, a linear model and k-nearest neighbor method, for predicting biodiversity of macroinvertebrates in a city river using the data from Wenyu River. Both Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index were considered for measuring the biodiversity of macroinvertebrates. The observed data of macroinvertebrates and 12 water quality indicators in Wenyu River, from 2010 to 2012, were applied in building and validating the predicted models. The results indicated that 1) The validity of the linear model was, though not perfect, better for predicting macroinvertebrates diversity using water quality indicators than k-nearest neighbor method in a city river; 2) Simpson index was more robust and accurate than the other biodiversity index to act as the variable of predicting benthic macroinvertebrates in a city river. There were 89.47% observations within the 99% confidence intervals. The developed predictive model was a useful tool for assessing river health, especially city river health, without taking into account the abundances of invertebrates.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2018	16	1					387	406		10.15666/aeer/1601_387406	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1601_387406													WOS:000424382600025

Agroforestry is a viable land-use option to counteract such declines in ecosystem services, including biodiversity and supporting local livelihoods. However, it is unclear how socioecological factors mediate these roles, which hinders the implementation of initiatives to conserve biodiversity. This study aimed to investigate perennial plant species composition and diversity in relation to socioecological variables and agroforestry practices in central Ethiopia. The vegetation data were collected from 243 sample farms that belonged to 81 randomly chosen households from nine kebeles. Across all practices, 92 plant species from 75 genera and 46 families were identified. Of these, 77% were native plant species, and the remaining were exotic ones. Margalef species richness and the Shannon diversity index were both significantly higher (p < 0.05) in homegardens and middle elevations. Furthermore, species richness and the Shannon diversity index were positively and significantly related to slope, farm size, farm age, and wealth status. Parklands, lowland altitude, and younger farms had the highest Simpson's evenness, whereas wealth status, farm size, and slope had no significant association with Simpson's evenness. Overall, this study showed that agroforestry serves as a refuge for native species and helps reverse species loss in natural forests. However, native species are gradually being replaced with exotic species, compromising the integrity of agricultural landscapes. Our study also emphasizes the urgent need to consider socioecological factors when examining biodiversity and planning agricultural landscape management strategies.																			0167-4366	1572-9680				2024 FEB	2024	98	2					461	476		10.1007/s10457-023-00924-1	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10457-023-00924-1		NOV 2023											WOS:001099812500002

CHARACTERIZATION OF 16 MICROSATELLITE MARKERS FOR THE OREINOTINUS CLADE OF VIBURNUM (ADOXACEAE)	APPLICATIONS IN PLANT SCIENCES												Premise of the study: Microsatellite loci were isolated from four species of Viburnum (Adoxaceae) to study population structure and assess species boundaries among morphologically similar South American Viburnum species of the Oreinotinus clade. Methods and Results: Using a microsatellite-enriched library and mining next-generation sequence data, 16 microsatellites were developed. Each locus was tested on two populations of V. triphyllum and one population of V. pichinchense. For nuclear loci, one to 13 alleles were recovered, expected heterozygosity ranged from 0 to 0.8975, Simpson diversity index ranged from 0.0167 to 1.000, and Shannon diversity index ranged from 0 to 2.3670 in a given population. For the mitochondrial locus, three to six alleles were recovered and unbiased haploid diversity values ranged from 0.756 to 0.853 in a given population. Conclusions: The 16 microsatellite loci developed for the Oreinotinus clade (Viburnum, Adoxaceae) will inform investigations of population structure and species boundaries within this group.																			2168-0450					DEC	2016	4	12							1600103	10.3732/apps.1600103	http://dx.doi.org/10.3732/apps.1600103								28101437					WOS:000391720000005

In total, 202,968 effective sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were generated from 16 samples that widely represented the diversity of the microbial communities. While Proteobacteria was found to be the dominant phylum in some samples, in other samples it was Bacteroidetes. The Simpson's diversity index and evenness index were lowest in samples from membrane bioreactors (MBRs), possibly due to the long sludge retention time (SRT) and low food/microorganism ratio (F/M). For one WWTP which had two disparate treatment processes operating in parallel, the structures of microbial communities in the two systems were compared. The differences found between the two indicated that the treatment process likely had effects on the structure of microbial communities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Community Structure of Oligochaetes (Annelida: Oligochaeta) of the Vychegda River in the Zone of Influence of Wastewater from Pulp and Paper Production	CONTEMPORARY PROBLEMS OF ECOLOGY												This paper contains original data on the composition and structure of Oligochaeta communities in the zone of influence of wastewater from a pulp and paper mill (the Vychegda River, Northern Dvina River basin). Forty species and forms of oligochaetes have been identified. We have found species which had been earlier identified only in tributary floodplain water bodies and lakes of the Vychegda River basin. According to the diversity index (Shannon index (H-N) and Simpson index (D-S)), evenness index (Pielow index (E)), and Whittaker (beta w) indices, the studied section of the river exceeds the control section in regards to species diversity. There is a significant increase in abundance and biomass of oligochaetes in comparison to the section upstream the river. Based on a correlation analysis between the quantitative development indicators of oligochaetes and the environmental parameters (type of substrate, presence of algal growths and macrophytes, depth, and chemical composition), an assessment of biotopic confinement of species (F-j), and the conjugate between species (r(A)), we found that the distribution of oligochaetes in the study area largely depends on the type of substrate. According to the results of the assessment of diversity and distribution of oligochaetes in the zone of influence of wastewater from a pulp and paper mill, the appearance of technogenic areas with an artificial substrate along the bank line leads to changes in the composition, diversity, and quantitative development characteristics of benthic organisms.

J	Reemts, CM; Eidson, JA				Reemts, Charlotte M.; Eidson, James A.			Choosing Plant Diversity Metrics: A Tallgrass Prairie Case Study	ECOLOGICAL RESTORATION												Diversity metrics are used to compare sites and to track trends within sites. Many metrics have been proposed, from simple species counts to complex indices like the Floristic Quality Index (FQI). Using a large dataset (n = 452 quadrats) from high-quality remnant prairie, degraded remnant prairie, and restoration sites, we examined correlations among ten diversity metrics and explored which metrics provide useful information about trends and differences among site types. We also created a conservatism list for 492 plant species of the Texas Blackland Prairie. Shannon diversity, Simpson diversity, and FQI were strongly correlated with species richness (r(2) > 0.53). Average conservatism varied greatly at low levels of richness and less at high levels of richness. This metric, which is usually considered to be independent of sample area, should be used with caution in sites with low richness. When assessing change in high-quality remnant prairie plots, native species richness increased the most. Average conservatism changed little, because an increase in specialist species (coefficient of conservatism >= 7) was matched by an increase in generalist forbs (coefficients 4-6). FQI increased, driven by changes in species richness rather than conservatism. When comparing site types, only FQI differed among all three site types; average conservatism and the number of specialist species also differed between remnant and restoration sites.

Influence of environmental factors on tree species diversity and composition in the Indian western Himalaya	FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT												Understanding patterns in forest communities and its driving factors play a critical role in ecological studies. In view of this, present study attempts to understand the role of environmental and anthropogenic factors towards shaping species diversity and composition along the altitudinal gradient (700-3800 m asl) in Indian western Himalaya. A total of 51 tree species (28 families) were recorded; Pinaceae (5) and Fagaceae (5) were the species rich families. alpha-diversity indices i.e., Margalef's richness index (R), Shannon index (HMODIFIER LETTER PRIME) and Simpson index showed a humped shaped distribution, whereas Evenness index (E) showed an inverted humped shaped distribution along the altitude range. Based on non-metric dimensional scaling (NMDS), four different community types were identified. Redundancy analysis (RDA) revealed a strong relationship of tree species composition with environmental (41.73% variation) and anthropogenic factors (17.35% variation). RDA further indicated that the bulk density (BD), disturbance index (DI), mean diurnal temperature range (Bio2) and solar radiation (SR) are significantly associated with sub-tropical (below 1200 m) and lower temperate forest (1200-1700 m) types. Likewise, soil organic carbon (SOC), precipitation of the driest quarter (Bio17) and pH were significantly associated with upper temperate (1700-2900 m), and subalpine forest composition (>2900 m). Both NMDS classification and RDA ordination clearly demonstrate spatial variability in composition of tree community and environmental properties.

W. Smith) Melchior, a widely distributed wild tea plant	WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY												Camellia taliensis (W. W. Smith) Melchior is a wild tea plant endemic from the west and southwest of Yunnan province of China to the north of Myanmar and is used commonly to produce tea by the local people of its growing areas. Its chemical constituents are closely related to those of C. sinensis var. assamica, a widely cultivated tea plant. In this study, the alpha diversity and phylogeny of endophytic fungi in the branches of C. taliensis were explored for the first time. A total of 160 fungal strains were obtained and grouped into 42 species from 29 genera, which were identified based on rDNA internal transcribed spacer sequence analysis. Diversity analysis showed that the endophytic fungal community of the branches of C. taliensis had high species richness S (42), Margalef index D (8.0785), Shannon-Wiener index H ' (2.8494), Simpson diversity index D-S (0.8891), PIE index (0.8947) and evenness Pielou index J (0.7623) but a low dominant index lambda (0.1109). By contrast, that in the branches of C. taliensis had abundant species and high species evenness. Diaporthe tectonigena, Acrocalymma sp. and Colletotrichum magnisporum were the dominant endophytic fungi. The phylogenetic tree was established by maximum parsimony analysis, and the 11 orders observed for endophytic fungi belonging to Ascomycota and Basidiomycota were grouped into 4 classes.

J	Cao, M; Zhang, JH				Cao, M; Zhang, JH			Tree species diversity of tropical forest vegetation in Xishuangbanna, SW China	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION												Tree species diversity of four tropical forest vegetation types was investigated in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. These are: tropical seasonal rain forest, tropical montane rain forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest and monsoon forest over limestone. A total of 17 samples were taken and four species diversity indices were calculated: Shannon-Wiener's H', the complement of Simpson's index, d', Fisher's alpha and evenness index E. The results reveal the long-tailed rank/abundance diagrams of these forests. However, this feature is greatly reduced in the samples of monsoon forest over limestone. Tropical seasonal rain forest shows the highest tree species diversity of all four vegetation types. Owing to the variation of microenvironment, diversity values within the same vegetation type vary between the samples from different patches. The tree species diversity of single-dominant rain forest is not significantly lower than that of mixed rain forest, because the dominant species of some single-dominant rain forests are principally in the emergent layer. This is composed of sparse and huge trees of one species and, consequently, creates a unique canopy architecture and more heterogeneous microenvironments for the more diversified species composition under the emergent layer. The occurrence of tree species with small population sizes, particularly of species represented by only one individual, is highly correlated with the tree species diversity of the local forest vegetation. They are crucial elements in the richness of local biodiversity.																			0960-3115	1572-9710				JUL	1997	6	7					995	1006		10.1023/A:1018367630923	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1018367630923													WOS:A1997XJ95700007

A rapid biodiversity assessment of plant species was conducted using visual encounter survey on patches of degraded fallow land and uncultivated marginal areas within commercial and subsistence agricultural landscapes. Measures of species diversity and richness were assessed using Shannon-Wiener Index (H') and Simpson's (D') indices to assess the effect of intensified cultivation on biodiversity. Results indicate that cultivation and intensified farming significantly influenced floristic composition within agricultural landscapes. Fallow areas were floristically rich in herbaceous plants that are adapted to frequently disturbed sites but poor in trees as opposed to uncultivated areas. Uncultivated areas recorded some endangered species including high value Pterocarpus angolensis. J. curcas cultivation should concentrate on degraded fallow areas as they contain species that are adapted to frequent disturbance while uncultivated areas within agricultural landscapes that have higher potential for conservation of indigenous woody species should be spared as village conservation sites.

L. camara invasion significantly increased contents of the soil organic matter, total N, P, K, available N, P and K and also enhanced the level and activities of urease, protease, invertase, cellulase and catalase. The BIOLOG results showed that Shannon index, McIntosh index, Simpson index and Richness index of the rhizosphere soil microbial communities were significantly higher than those of non-rhizosphere and control soil.

Characterization of rumen bacterial diversity and fermentation parameters in concentrate fed cattle with and without forage	JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY												Aims: To determine the effects of the removal of forage in high-concentrate diets on rumen fermentation conditions and rumen bacterial populations using culture-independent methods. Methods and Results: Detectable bacteria and fermentation parameters were measured in the solid and liquid fractions of digesta from cattle fed two dietary treatments, high concentrate (HC) and high concentrate without forage (HCNF). Comparison of rumen fermentation conditions showed that duration of time spent below pH 5.2 and rumen osmolality were higher in the HCNF treatment. Simpsons index of 16S PCR-DGGE images showed a greater diversity of dominant species in the HCNF treatment. Real-time qPCR showed populations of Fibrobacter succinogenes (P = 0.01) were lower in HCNF than HC diets. Ruminococcus spp., F.similar to succinogenes and Selenomonas ruminantium were at higher (P = 0.05) concentrations in the solid vs the liquid fraction of digesta regardless of diet. Conclusions: The detectable bacterial community structure in the rumen is highly diverse. Reducing diet complexity by removing forage increased bacterial diversity despite the associated reduction in ruminal pH being less conducive for fibrolytic bacterial populations. Quantitative PCR showed that removal of forage from the diet resulted in a decline in the density of some, but not all fibrolytic bacterial species examined. Significance and Impact of the Study: Molecular techniques such as DGGE and qPCR provide an increased understanding of the impacts of dietary changes on the nature of rumen bacterial populations, and conclusions derived using these techniques may not match those previously derived using traditional laboratory culturing techniques.

At first, four random primers, two used singly and two combined with the primer RD1, were chosen on the basis of their differentiating capability and reproducibility. The four resulting profiles for each isolate were integrated into a unique profile to be statistically treated by cluster analysis. The method was validated on 58 L sanfranciscensis isolates coming from three traditional Italian sourdoughs. This new RAPD method was useful for determining the genomic diversity within the L sanfranciscensis species. In particular, the intraspecific diversity of this species seemed to be related to the sourdough origin. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Up to twelve years ago the catchments of the two rivers were covered by tropical jungle; this has now been replaced by pasture and arable fields. Mean diversity indices of Simpson and Shannon indices were close to 0.6, which would indicate that human impact affected fish populations although the river beds have retained their original shape, except cleared of riparian trees. Despite their close location (about 18 km), the two streams differed from each other in their fish faunal composition. The distinctive nature of the fish communities in the two streams was a result of: conductivity, pH, also hiding places, riparian vegetation, submerged macrophytes and width of the rivers.

To achieve this objective, Landsat series data collected before and after community involvement in biodiversity conservation were used in conjunction with selected diversity indices i.e., Shannon-Wiener Index (H') and Simpson Index (D). Thirty 15 m x 15 m field plots were selected and all trees within each plot were identified, with the help of Botanists. Further, we applied regression analysis to determine the relationship between satellite derived tree species diversity and field observations. The results of the study demonstrated a significant (p < 0.5) variation in tree species diversity between 1990 and 2019. The highest relationship was obtained between H' and the combined remotely sensed spectral data and as well as Indices (VIs) when compared to other derived satellite data. Further, the results showed positive significant relationship (p < 0.05) between the combined remotely sensed data and observed H' index with r(2) = 0.36 and r(2) = 0.34 for the period before and after involving local communities in biodiversity conservation, respectively. Thus, the findings of the study indicate that the ecological condition of the reserve was slightly affected by the involvement of local communities in biodiversity conservation, for instance, volunteering in bush-encroachment eradication and decision-making. Overall, findings of the study underscore the relevance of remotely sensed data in assessing the ecological condition of protected areas and this information can help in decision-making.					dhau, inos/AAQ-8433-2021	Dube, Timothy/0000-0003-3456-8991													1010-6049	1752-0762				2022 JAN 7	2022	37	2					526	542		10.1080/10106049.2020.1723717	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10106049.2020.1723717		APR 2020											WOS:000527165500001

R.; Parsons, Stuart			Spatiotemporal and demographic variation in the diet of New Zealand lesser short-tailed bats (<i>Mystacina tuberculata</i>)	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION												Variation in the diet of generalist insectivores can be affected by site-specific traits including weather, habitat, and season, as well as demographic traits such as reproductive status and age. We used molecular methods to compare diets of three distinct New Zealand populations of lesser short-tailed bats, Mystacina tuberculata. Summer diets were compared between a southern cold-temperate (Eglinton) and a northern population (Puroera). Winter diets were compared between Pureora and a subtropical offshore island population (Hauturu). This also permitted seasonal diet comparisons within the Pureora population. Lepidoptera and Diptera accounted for >80% of MOTUs identified from fecal matter at each site/season. The proportion of orders represented within prey and the Simpson diversity index, differed between sites and seasons within the Pureora population. For the Pureora population, the value of the Simpson diversity index was higher in summer than winter and was higher in Pureora compared to Eglinton. Summer Eglinton samples revealed that juvenile diets appeared to be more diverse than other demographic groups. Lactating females had the lowest dietary diversity during summer in Pureora. In Hauturu, we found a significant negative relationship between mean ambient temperature and prey richness. Our data suggest that M.tuberculata incorporate a narrower diversity of terrestrial insects than previously reported. This provides novel insights into foraging behavior and ecological interactions within different habitats. Our study is the first from the Southern Hemisphere to use molecular techniques to examine spatiotemporal variation in the diet of a generalist insectivore that inhabits a contiguous range with several habitat types and climates.

Methods: Larvae and adult mosquitoes were collected using the standard methods from different habitats in nine localities of three counties in the East Azerbaijan Province, Northwestern Iran during June to October 2017. In addition, species richness (R), Simpson's diversity index (D), Shannon-Wiener index (H) and evenness (E) as measures of diversity, were calculated. Results: Overall, 1401 mosquito specimens including 1015 adults and 386 larvae were collected in the study area. The properties of geographical larval habitats were recorded. Four genera along with 10 species were collected and identified, including Anopheles hyrcanus, An. maculipennis s.l., An. superpictus s.l., Aedes caspius, Ae. vexans, Culex pipiens, Cx. theileri, Cx. perexiguus, Culiseta longiareolata and Cs. subochrea. Among the three counties, Ahar region presented the highest species richness (R: 1.5) and diversity values (D: 0.79, H': 1.74, E: 0.73). Conclusion: This study provides important information on the diversity, distribution and ecology of ten mosquito species in the region.

Although exotic cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, is an increasing threat to mangrove ecosystems (including the associated unvegetated shoals) of China, its effects on the avifauna in such ecosystems are poorly understood. In Zhanjiang, China, the avifaunal Shannon-Weiner diversity, Simpson's diversity, Margalef's species richness, Pielou's evenness and density indices were compared in (1) an Avicennia marina monoculture vs. an S. alterniflora-invaded A. marina stand (a mixture of A. marina and S. alterniflora) and (2) an unvegetated shoal vs. an S. alterniflora-invaded shoal that had rapidly become an S. alterniflora monoculture. All avifaunal community parameters except for the Simpson index were significantly lower in the S. alterniflora thorn A. marina mixture than in the A. marina monoculture, and in the S. alterniflora monoculture than in the unvegetated shoal. These results indicate that the presence of S. alterniflora reduces the suitability of the Zhanjiang mangrove ecosystem for avifauna. Among the four habitats, the Shannon-Weiner diversity index, species richness, and density of the avifaunal community were highest in the unvegetated shoal. Further analysis indicated that the differences in the avifaunal community between invaded and noninvaded sites were associated with vegetation characteristics (mainly plant height and density) and macrobenthic faunal metrics (mainly species richness and density). The reduced avifaunal diversity and abundance associated with S. alterniflora invasion probably resulted from the decline in food resources or from the increased difficulty in foraging and roosting. The findings indicate that the conservation of birds in mangrove ecosystems may depend on controlling or eradicating exotic S. alterniflora, maintaining tidal mudflats, and diversifying the habitats in mangrove wetlands.

The parasitic community had average diversity of 1.79, calculated by Shannon-Wiener Index, and 0.77 by Simpson's Index of Diversity. The evenness (Pietou's Index) presented an average of 0.28. The intensity of infection had a positive correlation with the parasite richness (P<0.05) and the diversity (P<0.01). Specimens of C. nassatus showed preference for the ventral colon (P<0.01), Cyathostomum coronatus for the caectum (P<0.01), C. longibursatus and C. goldi a preference for both the ventral colon and the dorsal colon (P<0.01).

J	Tran, H; Iida, S; Inoue, S				Tran, H; Iida, S; Inoue, S			Species composition, diversity and structure of secondary tropical forests following selective logging in Huong Son, Ha Tinh Province, Vietnam	JOURNAL OF THE FACULTY OF AGRICULTURE KYUSHU UNIVERSITY												Species composition, diversity and structure of Huong Son secondary forests post-logged 2 years (PL2), 12 years (PL12) and 22 years (PL22) were studied in May 2004. Percent composition of families and number of commercial species found in the plot PL2 were lower in comparison with those of the two other plots. The medium Sorensen similarity index, ranging from 29.55 to 40.25%, found for all tree size classes showed a slightly high dissimilarity between plots. Simpson's index for all tree size classes was quite similar among plots though only small difference was found for seedlings in the plot PL2. Shannon-Wiener index (H') in all plots exhibited relatively high, ranging from 1.76 to 3.48, for all size classes combined but revealed slightly low diversity indices for commercial species. Species richness and evenness (H) turned out to be the best indices for demonstrating diversity among plots. The size class distribution with Weibull model showed nearly a continuously inverse J-shaped curve. Except the plot PL2 and the plot. PL12 followed a similarly exponential trend, the plot PL22 showed a left skewed shape. However, the result of basal area showed that the PL12 had lower basal area than others. All plots showed having some commercial species with relatively high importance value index along with a proportion contributed by other noncommercial ones, i.e. Syzygium cinereum and Diospyros apiculata.																			0023-6152					OCT	2005	50	2					551	571																WOS:000233119700025

A Random Forest Modelling Procedure for a Multi-Sensor Assessment of Tree Species Diversity	REMOTE SENSING												Earth observation data can provide important information for tree species diversity mapping and monitoring. The relatively recent advances in remote sensing data characteristics and processing systems elevate the potential of satellite imagery for providing accurate, timely, consistent, and robust spatially explicit estimates of tree species diversity over forest ecosystems. This study was conducted in Northern Pindos National Park, the largest terrestrial park in Greece and aimed to assess the potential of four satellite sensors with different instrumental characteristics, for the estimation of tree diversity. Through field measurements, we originally quantified two diversity indices, namely the Shannon diversity index (H') and Simpson's diversity (D1). Random forest regression models were developed for associating remotely sensed spectral signal with tree species diversity within the area. The models generated from the use of the WorldView-2 image were the most accurate with a coefficient of determination of up to 0.44 for H' and 0.37 for D1. The Sentinel-2 -based models of tree species diversity performed slightly worse, but were better than the Landsat-8 and RapidEye models. The coefficient of variation quantifying internal variability of spectral values within each plot provided little or no usage for improving the modelling accuracy. Our results suggest that very-high-spatial-resolution imagery provides the most important information for the assessment of tree species diversity in heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems.

J	Rassati, G; Battisti, C				Rassati, Gianluca; Battisti, Corrado			Detecting changes induced by industrialization on bird communities: a before-after comparison using diversity/dominance curves	COMMUNITY ECOLOGY												To detect stress affecting bird communities after the construction of an industrial area (Carnia, North-eastern Italy), a before (2004)-after (2014) comparison has been performed, using the diversity/dominance (or 'stress') curves. We observed a marked decrease in number of species (31 vs. 20), in pair densities (292 vs. 120) and in Shannon diversity index (2.97 vs. 2.56), with an increase in dominance concentration index (Simpson: 0.04 vs. 0.06). Although, at singles species level, only Lanius collurio showed a significant reduction (p < 0.05), the change in slope of the 'stress curves' makes explicit the disruption in general pattern of frequencies, with an increase of generalist/edge species and the disappearance of forest-interior and agro-mosaic sensitive species. 'Stress curves' appeared a useful tool to detect the effects of change in land use due to industrialization at community level. We stimulate community ecologists to apply more frequently this analysis to detect the effects of anthropogenic threats on animal communities.

The experiment consisted of the control and three types of biofloc systems using different carbon sources, tapioca starch (TS), plant cellulose (PC) and the combination of tapioca starch and plant cellulose (TS + PC), and conducted for 42 days in twelve 300 L Fiber Reinforce Plastic (FRP) circular tanks. Pelteobagrus vachelli (n = 72) of mean weight (38.1 +/- 5.9 g) were randomly distributed into twelve tanks. Community characterization of total bacteria and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria in all treatments were respectively investigated by Illumina MiSeq analysis using PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments (primer 27F-338R for total bacteria and primer CTO189F-CTO654R for ammonia-oxidizing bacteria). The ammonia-nitrogen concentration in control (3.6 +/- 4.6 mg L-1) was significantly higher than that in all biofloc systems (2.4 +/- 2.9 mg L-1, 1.8 +/- 2.4 mg L-1 and 2.2 +/- 2.5 mg L-1 for TS, PC and TS + PC, respectively) (P < 0.05). Weight gain ratio in TS was significantly higher than the control (P < 0.05), while there is no significant difference between the control and treatment groups added plant cellulose (PC and TS + PC) (P > 0.05). The Illumina MiSeq sequencing results showed that biofloc systems incorporating plant cellulose treatment groups had a higher total bacterial diversity and greater microbial richness than those with no plant cellulose treatment groups (Control and TS) (P < 0.05). There was significant increase of Betaproteobacteria in the control and TS treatments, whereas Alphaproteobacteria was higher in treatment groups added plant cellulose (P < 0.05). Illumina sequencing analysis of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria V3 region also detected a higher community diversity in biofloc systems (Shannon index,> 1.21; Simpson index,< 0.3949) compared to control (Shannon index, 0.84; Simpson index, 0.6149). We conclude that organic carbon sources in biofloc system can decrease ammonia-nitrogen concentration and improve the community diversities of overall and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria.

However, whether and how grazing affects plant-soil biota interactions are limited. Here, we performed a field investigation on the Tibetan grasslands to determine the relationships between plant community properties (biomass, diversity and richness) and soil biota (abundance, diversity and composition of bacteria, fungi and nematodes) in the long-term yak grazing and ungrazed plots, and responses of plant-soil biota linkages to grazing in alpine meadows and alpine swampy meadows were compared. The results found that grazing did not cause significant changes in plant community properties but increased the soil water content. Further, grazing weakened plant-soil microbes/nematode relationships in alpine meadows. The bacterial and fungal abundances were correlated with plant belowground biomass and Simpson index in the ungrazed plots of alpine meadows, while the correlation was not significant under grazing. Bacterial composition was correlated with plant richness only in the ungrazed meadows. Plant-soil nematode linkages were more sensitive to grazing than plant-microbes linkages. Grazing decoupled the relationships between the abundances of nematode trophic groups and plant aboveground biomass, richness and Simpson index in alpine meadows, while the decoupling phenomenon is less evident in alpine swampy meadows. The SEM results indicate that grazing altered the plant above- and belowground biomass to affect the soil nematode community, while influenced soil microbes only through alterations of plant belowground biomass. The findings highlight the importance of grazing in influencing the interactions between aboveground plant communities and soil biological communities in Tibetan grasslands.																			0048-9697	1879-1026				2024 FEB 25	2024	913								169417	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169417	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.169417		JAN 2024						38143005					WOS:001154582100001

However, diverse biotic and abiotic factors can disturb this process. Dendroctonus bark beetles (Curculionidae: Scolytinae) are natural inhabitants of pine forests, some of which produce periodic outbreaks, killing thousands of trees in the process. These insects spend almost their entire life cycle under tree bark, where they reproduce and feed on phloem. Tunneling and feeding of the beetles result in the death of the tree and an alteration of the resident microbiota as well as the introduction of microbes that the beetles vector. To understand how microbial communities in subcortical tissues of pines change after they are colonized by the bark beetle Dendroctonus rhizophagus, we compare both the bacterial and fungal community structures in two colonization stages of Pinus arizonica (Arizona pine) employing Illumina MiSeq. Our findings showed significant differences in diversity and the dominance of bacterial community in the two colonization stages with Shannon (P=0.004) and Simpson (P=0.0006) indices, respectively, but not in species richness with Chao1 (P=0.19). In contrast, fungal communities in both stages showed significant differences in species richness with Chao1 (P=0.0003) and a diversity with Shannon index (P=0.038), but not in the dominance with the Simpson index (P=0.12). The -diversity also showed significant changes in the structure of bacterial and fungal communities along the colonization stages, maintaining the dominant members in both cases. Our results suggest that microbial communities present in the Arizona pine at the tree early colonization stage by bark beetle change predictably over time.

Varying topsoil depth may influence reclamation success. This study assessed the effect of four different topsoil addition depths (0, 4, 8, and 12 cm) on plant community attributes (community coverage, height, species richness, diversity, and production). In 4 grassland, species amount in the mining area were the most at the 8 cm and 12 cm. Percent canopy cover and height of grasses were highest at the 12 cm topsoil depth and lowest at the 0 cm topsoil depth. Species richness(R), diversity indices (H) and dominance indices (D) were highest at the 12 cm topsoil depth and lowest at the 0 cm topsoil depth. Evenness indices (J(sw)) was highest at the 0 cm topsoil depth and lowest at the 8 cm topsoil depth. Aboveground biomass was similar between the 8 cm and 12 cm topsoil depths and higher than 0 and 4 cm topsoil depths. The coverage, height, species richness, diversity and aboveground biomass of grassland community generally increased with variable topsoil depth, while evenness fluctuated. However, there was no significant difference between 8 cm topsoil depth and 12 cm topsoil depth in community cover, plant height, aboveground biomass and diversity indices. And there was positive correlation between community productivity and Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices. Therefore, for the Kurt Kizu mining area, considering comprehensively economic investment against ecological benefits when restoring damaged steppe, the appropriate topsoil addition depth for grassland vegetation restoration is 8 cm.					zhou, chuyue/JOJ-9001-2023; Xu, Hailiang/E-5681-2018														1018-4619	1610-2304					2017	26	3					2214	2220																WOS:000399966600045

Using the Gini-Simpson index, a measure of biodiversity drawn from ecological sciences, we find that banking diversity would have reduced firms' exit rates in the period under investigation (2009-2020), and such a beneficial effect appears sharper for the years of the last financial-sovereign crisis. Both of these findings seem to support the "biodiversity argument" pioneered by Ayadi et al. (2009, 2010), stating that - beyond the merits of any particular bank institutional model - it is indeed the coexistence of a mix of different credit institutions that matters in favouring the financing of the real economy, especially in a scenario characterized by financial turmoil and uncertainty. As a policy recommendation, authorities should promote regulations that, avoiding bias towards a specific bank model, aim to preserve and promote biodiversity in the banking sector.

Natural environments in the urban context and gut microbiota in infants	ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL												The biodiversity hypothesis that contact with natural environments (e.g. native vegetation) and biodiversity, through the influence of environmental microbes, may be beneficial for human commensal microbiota has been insufficiently tested. We aimed to study the association between living near natural environments in the urban context, and gut microbiota diversity and composition in young infants. Based on data linkage between the unique Urban Primary Land and Vegetation Inventory (uPLVI) for the city of Edmonton and 355 infants in the CHILD Cohort Study, infant exposure to natural environments (any and specific types, yes/no) was determined within 500 m and 1000 m of their home residence. Gut microbiota composition and diversity at age 4 months was assessed in infant fecal samples. Adjusted for covariates, we observed a reduced odds of high microbial alpha-diversity in the gut of infants exposed to any natural environment within 500 m [Shannon index aOR (95%CI) = 0.63 (0.40, 0.98) and Simpson index = 0.63 (0.41, 0.98)]. In stratified analyses, these associations remained only among infants not breastfed or living with household pets. When doubly stratifying by these variables, the reduced likelihood of high alpha-diversity was present only among infants who were not breastfed and lived with household pets [9% of the study population, Shannon index = 0.07 (0.01, 0.49) and Simpson index = 0.11 (0.02, 0.66)]. Differences in beta-diversity was also seen (p = 0.04) with proximity to a nature space in not breastfed and pets-exposed infants. No associations were observed among infants who were fully formula-fed but without pets at home. When families and their pets had close access to a natural environment, Verrucomicrobiales colonization was reduced in the gut microbiota of formula-fed infants, the abundance of Clostridiales was depleted, whereas the abundance of Enterobacteriales was enriched. Our double-stratified results indicate that proximity to a natural environment plus pet ownership has the capacity to alter the gut microbiota of formula-fed infants. Further research is needed to replicate and better interpret these results, as well as to understand their health consequences.

MULTIVARIATE IMPACT ANALYSIS OF <i>PARTHENIUM HYSTEROPHORUS</i> INVASION ON ABOVE-GROUND PLANT DIVERSITY IN POTHWAR REGION OF PAKISTAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												Phytosociological studies help to understand extent of biological invasion. Multiple analyses of ecological parameters at different locations derive general explanations of impact on species diversity in plant communities. Current study assessed the impact of Parthenium hysterophorus (an annual weed of great significance in Pakistan and worldwide) invasion on native vegetation in Pothwar region of Pakistan. The approach used for the study was random samplings with two categorical factors: invaded and non-invaded under same habitat conditions. Differences in number of species (S), abundance (N), species richness (R), evenness (J'), Shannon diversity index (H') and Simpson index of dominance (lambda) were compared between invaded and control plots by t-test series. Control plots harbored by average of 0.9 more species per 10 m(2). The control category was more diverse (H' = 1.73) than invaded category (H' = 1.53). The higher value of species richness in control plots shows the heterogeneous nature of communities and vice versa in invaded plots. The lower value of index of dominance in invaded plots shows less sample diversity than in the control ones. At multivariate scale, ordination (nMDS) and ANOSIM showed significant magnitude of differences between invaded and control plots in all sites. The most effected site by Parthenium invasion was Jhelum followed by Attock, Rawalpindi, Chakwal and Islamabad. The decrease in diversity indices in invaded over control sites indicated less productive plant communities due to Parthenium invasion. This makes Parthenium a candidate of consideration for appropriate control measures.

The study was conducted regularly at 15-day intervals during 2012 and 2013. A total of 480 individuals belonging to 10 genera and 55 species of Alticini were collected. Among them Longitarsus aeruginosus (Foudras, 1860) (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) was determined as new record for the Alticini fauna of Turkey and is presented with related figures. According to Shannon-Wiener, Simpson and Berger-Parker indices of diversity, Meadow area 1 (MA1) was detected as the most diverse habitat. Jaccard and Bray-Curtis similarity indices showed that Alticini communities in Olive grove area 1 (OGA1) and Meadow area 1 (MA1) were more closely related. Data gathered from regular samplings were also displayed by graphics obtained from analyses of Rarefaction and Abundance plot k-dominance.

J	Lv, Y; Ren, G; Ren, XJ				Lv, Yan; Ren, Gang; Ren, Xiaojun			Changes of Intestinal Flora and Lymphocyte Subsets in Patients with Chronic Renal Failure	EVIDENCE-BASED COMPLEMENTARY AND ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE												Objective. To explore the changes of intestinal flora and lymphocyte subsets in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). Methods. 60 CRF patients who were treated from June 2018 to June 2019 were selected; 60 healthy persons were selected as the control group. 16S rDNA was used to detect the expression of Lactobacillus, Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Bifidobacterium in the feces of the two groups. Illumina Miseq sequencing (Solexa sequencing technology) method was used to analyze the structural differences and species diversity of intestinal flora, including species richness index (Chao) and diversity index (Shannon, Simpson). Flow cytometry was used to detect the levels of lymphocytes and their subgroups of the two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between Chao and lymphocyte subsets. Results. The number of Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus in CRF group were higher than those in the control group (P<0.05), while the Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Clostridium, and Bifidobacterium were opposite (P<0.05). The Simpson index of the CRF group was lower than that of the control group, while the Chao index and Shannon index were opposite (P<0.05). The levels of CD3(+), CD4(+), CD8(+), and CD4(+)/CD8(+) in the CRF group were lower than those in the control group, while the levels of CD14(+), CD19(+), and CD16(+)/CD56(+) were opposite (P<0.05). The intestinal flora Chao index of CRF group was negatively correlated with the levels of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) (r = -0.692, P=0.019; r = -0.669, P=0.021; r = -0.603, P=0.028). The intestinal flora Chao of CRF group is positively correlated with the level of CD14(+) and CD16(+)/CD56(+) (r = 0.615, P=0.026; r = 0.758, P=0.016). Conclusion. There are intestinal flora disorder and the imbalance of immune function in CRF patients, which are mainly manifested in the change of intestinal flora structure, the increase of richness and diversity of intestinal flora, and the decrease of lymphocyte subgroups. There is correlation between the imbalance of intestinal colony and the imbalance of immune function.																			1741-427X	1741-4288				OCT 15	2021	2021								4288739	10.1155/2021/4288739	http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2021/4288739								34764999					WOS:000719628700001

Here, we tested the recently proposed U-shaped biodiversity model of forest succession. A chronosequence of 11 stands spanning from 5 to 400 years since the last disturbance was used. Understory species presence was recorded along 200 m long transects of 20 x 20 cm quadrates. Alpha diversity (species richness, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices) and three types of beta diversity indices were assessed at multiple scales. Beta diversity was expressed by a) spatial compositional variability (number and diversity of species combinations), b) pairwise spatial turnover (between plots Sorensen, Jaccard, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity), and c) spatial variability coefficients (CV% of alpha diversity measures). Our results supported the U-shaped model for both alpha and beta diversity. The strongest differences appeared between active and abandoned coppices. The maximum beta diversity emerged at characteristic scales of 2 m in young coppices and 10 m in later successional stages. We conclude that traditional coppice management maintains high structural diversity and heterogeneity in the understory. The similarly high beta diversities in active coppices and old-growth forests suggest the presence of microhabitats for specialist species of high conservation value.

In this study, 16S rDNA, 18S rDNA, and ITS meta-sequencing were performed using the genomic DNA obtained from the rhizosphere of Caesalpinia bonducella-a medicinal shrub widely used to treat polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Of the 665 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) obtained from 16S rDNA sequencing, 23.9% comprised of microbes that increase the therapeutic value of plants (Bacillus, Paenibacillus), 6.4% belonged to stress and drought tolerant microbes (Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Serratia), 8% belonged to plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria-predominantly Proteobacteria, and Firmicutes and the remaining were the microbes performing various other functions. Alpha diversity indexing by GAIA-metagenomics tool revealed the presence of a highly diverse group of microbes in the rhizosphere of C. bonducella; Chao.1 index (665), Shannon Weiner index (3.53), Simpson index (0.83) and Fisher index (106.13). The highly diverse microbes lingering around the roots of C. bonducella could possibly be due to a strong symbiotic association with the plant; root exudates nourish the microbes and the microbes in turn enrich the medicinal value of the plant.						, Balasundaram Usha/0000-0003-3039-9131													0971-5894	0974-0430				2020 DEC	2020	26	12					2453	2463		10.1007/s12298-020-00915-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12298-020-00915-x		DEC 2020						33424158					WOS:000599797300001

COMMUNITIES IN DONGLING MOUNTAIN MEADOW, BEIJING, CHINA	PAKISTAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY												Gentiana macrophylla, native to mountainous areas of Central and Southern Asia, is most popular remedy for rheumatism and pains in Traditional Chinese Medicine with an extensive demand in local market. Our study aimed to classify G. macrophylla communities and to find out the impact of topographic and soil factors on their diversity and distribution in Dongling mountain meadow, Beijing, China. Seventy five samples in 15 transects separated by 50m distance in altitude along an elevation gradient (1592-2298m) were established by quadrate method. TWINSAPN and CCA were used for classification and ordination, respectively. Six diversity indices (Species richness, Shannon-Weiner heterogeneity, Simpson's index, Hill's index, Pielou evenness and McIntosh evenness) were used to analyze the pattern of species diversity and polynomial regression analysis was used to establish their relationship with environmental variables. TWINSPAN classified G. macrophylla communities into 8 types and CCA indicated that soil pH, soil temperature, soil type, disturbance, total N, total K, Mg and Zn were significantly related to these communities. Elevation was the most significant factor that affecting the diversity and distribution of G. macrophylla communities Significant effect of environment, topography and disturbance to meadow communities of G. macrophylla highly suggests some important measures such as uprooting restriction, tourism limitation in meadow area, monitoring of functional diversity, fertilization, irrigation, cloning and cultivation to protect and conserve it and its communities to be used in medicine industry.					aslam, sidra/AAT-4467-2020; Tariq, Akash/AAI-9880-2020; Shedayi, Arshad Ali/AAC-4264-2022; Shedayi, Arshad Ali/K-5596-2019; Bai, Xiaohang/IAR-3793-2023	Shedayi, Arshad Ali/0000-0003-4933-1946; Bai, Xiaohang/0000-0002-6949-2299													0556-3321	2070-3368				OCT	2017	49	5					1725	1734																WOS:000419148600012

A majority belonged to the class Deuteromycetes, followed by Ascomycetes. Mortierella was the dominant genus followed by Fusarium and Penicillium. We observed a mean of 5.63 +/- 2.37 and 7.63 +/- 2.97 genera per hectare and estimated a 50 ha-wide total of 43 and 69 genera during the two seasons respectively. We estimate the number of species in the 16 hectares sampled as 207 and 284 respectively. The mean fungal population density over the same two seasons was 2.67 +/- 1.49 X 104 and 2.14 +/- 0.69 X 10(4) cultivable clones per g of soil. Indices of diversity were 3.1 and 3.6 (Shannon-Wiener), 5.3 and 8.8 (Fisher's alpha) and 0.79 and 0.86 (Simpson) respectively, all in terms of genus as OTU.																			0011-3891					SEP 10	2007	93	5					669	677																WOS:000249548900023

A total of 21 species under six orders nine families and 18 genera were recorded which is comparatively low than previous records. The fish abundance similarity showed a maximum similarity of 78% between site 1 and site 3 clusters. The results of species composition showed increased abundance of O. niloticus species (> 80%) in the fishery and have now established feral population in the reservoir. The mean Simpson dominance index (1 - lambda), the Shannon diversity index (H '), Pielou's evenness index (J ') and Margalef's richness index (d) were determined for three different sites followed by Mann-Whitney U test which showed a significant difference at spatial scale. Bray-Curtis cluster analysis of physicochemical parameters showed a similarity of 96% between site 1 and site 2. Comparison with the previous study three physicochemical parameters (total alkalinity, total hardness and chloride) showed the considerable changes. Relationships between fish assemblages and environmental parameters were examined by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Six physicochemical parameters (i.e., DO, pH, Nitrate, Mg, Phosphate and Silicate) showed statistically significant to shaping fish diversity (p < 0.05). The high value of dissolved oxygen coupled with low biochemical oxygen demand and other nutrient levels indicates that the water body is moderately oligotrophic in nature. The responsible factors for declining indigenous fish population and threats are discussed. The study recommends specific management measures which could be useful to develop a sustainable fishery practice vis-a-vis conservation of fish diversity.

Reproducibility and repeatability of six high-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing protocols for microbiota profiling	JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGICAL METHODS												Culture-independent molecular techniques and advances in next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies make large-scale epidemiological studies on microbiota feasible. A challenge using NGS is to obtain high reproducibility and repeatability, which is mostly attained through robust amplification. We aimed to assess the reproducibility of saliva microbiota by comparing triplicate samples. The microbiota was produced with simplified in-house 16S amplicon assays taking advantage of large number of barcodes. The assays included primers with Truseq (TS-tailed) or Nextera (NX-tailed) adapters and either with dual index or dual index plus a 6-nt internal index. All amplification protocols produced consistent microbial profiles for the same samples. Although, in our study, reproducibility was highest for the TS-tailed method. Five replicates of a single sample, prepared with the TS-tailed 1-step protocol without internal index sequenced on the HiSeq platform provided high alpha-diversity and low standard deviation (mean Shannon and Inverse Simpson diversity was 3.19 +/- 0.097 and 13.56 +/- 1.634 respectively). Large-scale profiling of microbiota can consistently be produced by all 16S amplicon assays. The TS-tailed-1S dual index protocol is preferred since it provides repeatable profiles on the HiSeq platform and are less labour intensive.

As part of air extensive study of the effect of rootworm Bt corn (Cry3Bb1) on nontarget invertebrates, we evaluated both the abundance and diversity of surface-active (epedaphic) and subsurface (euedaphic) spring-tails at Ames, IA, and Monmouth, IL, in 2-yr field trials during 2000-2002. Springtails were collected from pitfall traps and soil cores in plots planted with rootworm Bt corn and its non-Bt isoline. Few differences were observed in the abundance of individual species in Bt and isoline corn. Nor did the estimated species richness or the Shannon or Simpson diversity indices differ significantly between Bt and isoline corn at either location during 2000-2002, indicating no effect of Bt corn on springtail diversity. In soil insecticide-treated plots, however, springtails were consistently more abundant than in check plots, perhaps because of adverse insecticide effects on springtail predators. Soil insecticide also reduced both Shannon and Simpson diversity in the Iowa euedaphic and Illinois epedaphic populations. Such consistent insecticide effects on both abundance and diversity of springtails provide a positive control by which to assess the power of the experimental design to detect a comparable impact of Bt corn on springtails. They also show that insecticide use more strongly impacts springtails and their predators than does the practice of growing transgenic crops to control the same pests.																			0046-225X	1938-2936				OCT	2005	34	5					1346	1376		10.1603/0046-225X(2005)034[1346:BACSOE]2.0.CO;2	http://dx.doi.org/10.1603/0046-225X(2005)034[1346:BACSOE]2.0.CO;2													WOS:000232405800038
J	Uddin, MN; Robinson, RW				Uddin, Md N.; Robinson, Randall W.			Changes associated with <i>Phragmites australis</i> invasion in plant community and soil properties: A study on three invaded communities in a wetland, Victoria, Australia	LIMNOLOGICA												Phragmites australis invasion is altering plant communities and therefore, soil properties have been changed significantly. This study compared the diversity among three communities in a wetland to assess the impact of invasion by Phragmites and the associated impact on soil properties. Three diversity indices, species richness (S), evenness (E) and Shanon-Weiner index (H) had significantly higher values in uninvaded plots compared to invaded in all the communities. Invaded plots had the lowest diversity, with H = 0 and Simpson's index (D) = 1, (i.e. they were monospecific). These results support the idea that a reduction in diversity can be expected in wetlands colonized by Phragmites. Phragmites invasion significantly increased soil moisture, EC, phenolics, organic carbon, dehydrogenase activity and microbial biomass (C, N, P) with reduction of pH and arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi spore density compared with uninvaded zones. In addition, the study of antifungal phytochemistry of Phragmites elucidated the decrease of the competitive abilities of native plant Melaleuca ericifolia by interfering with formation of mycorrhizal associations and biomass. Our results suggest that Phragmites invasion has caused significant ecological alterations in communities by demonstrating a combined effect to plant diversity and soil variables.

MPR models are able to capture complex interactions in the data while being tractable and transparent for further analysis. The performance of the MPR modeling approach was compared to previous work using artificial neural networks. The data were obtained from hydromorphologically modified Polish rivers with a widely varying water quality. The modeled indices were the Macrophyte Index for Rivers (MIR), the Macrophyte Biological Index for Rivers (IBMR), and the River Macrophyte Nutrient Index (RMNI). These indices measure the trophic and ecological status of the rivers. Additionally, two biological diversity indices, species richness (N) and the Simpson index (D), were modeled. The explanatory variables were physico-chemical properties depicting water quality and river hydromorphological status indices. In comparison to artificial neural networks, the MPR models performed similarly in terms of goodness of fit. However, the MPR models had advantages such as model simplicity and ability to be subject to effective visualization of complex nonlinear input-output relationships, as well as facilitating sensitivity analysis using importance ratios to identify effects of individual input variables.

J.; Navarro, Laetitia M.; Schiffers, Katja H.; Visconti, Piero; Rondinini, Carlo			Assessing the suitability of diversity metrics to detect biodiversity change	BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION												A large number of diversity metrics are available to study and monitor biodiversity, and their responses to biodiversity changes are not necessarily coherent with each other. The choice of biodiversity metrics may thus strongly affect our interpretation of biodiversity change and, hence, prioritization of resources for conservation. Therefore it is crucial to understand which metrics respond to certain changes, are the most sensitive to change, show consistent responses across different communities, detect early signals of species decline, and are insensitive to demographic stochasticity. Here we generated synthetic communities and simulated changes in their composition according to 9 scenarios of biodiversity change to investigate the behaviour of 12 biodiversity metrics. Metrics showed diverse abilities to detect changes under different scenarios. Sorensen similarity index, arithmetic and geometric mean abundance, and species and functional richness were the most sensitive to community changes. Sorensen similarity index, species richness and geometric abundance showed consistent responses across all simulated communities and scenarios. Sorensen similarity index and geometric mean abundance were able to detect early signals of species decline. Geometric mean abundance, and functional evenness under certain scenarios, had the greatest ability to distinguish directional trends from stochastic changes, but Sorensen similarity index and geometric mean abundance were the only indices to show consistent signals under all replicates and scenarios. Classic abundance-weighted heterogeneity indices (e.g. Shannon index) were insensitive to certain changes or showed misleading responses, and are therefore unsuitable for comparison of biological communities. We therefore suggest that separate metrics of species composition, richness, and abundance should be reported instead of (or in addition to) composite metrics like the Shannon index.

Tree diversity and community composition in sacred forests are superior than the other community forests in a human-dominated landscape of Meghalaya	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Tree diversity and community composition in six sacred forests (SF) of Meghalaya were compared with those of six adjacent community forests (CF) to understand how protection provided to sacred forests by the communities impacts their diversity and community characteristics. The SFs harboured a greater number of tree species (187) compared to the CFs (56). Tree density in the SFs ranged from 750 trees ha(-1) (MKSF) to 1470 trees ha(-1) (MTSF) while in CFs, it was 875 trees ha(-1) (ILCF) to 1236 trees ha(1) (NBCF). Among the SFs, the highest basal area was recorded in MNSF (56.89 m(2) ha(-1)) and least in NBSF (40.75 m(2) ha(-1)), while among the CFs tree basal area ranged from 23.7 m(2) ha(-1) in MKCF to 36.0 m(2) ha(-1) in MNCF. The canopy cover in SFs ranged from 73.3 to 86.2% while in CFs it ranged from 54.3 to 70.8%. Species rank abundance distribution (RAD) curve or dominance-diversity curve showed high equitability and low dominance in all the six SFs while the RAD curve showed high dominance and low equitability in all the six CFs. The dominance-diversity curve in the SFs followed a log-normal distribution whereas the CFs exhibited a broken stick distribution pattern. Among the CFs, Pinus kesiya was the dominant tree species in five out of six study sites. The dominant species were different for different SFs, which were Microtropis discolour (ILSF), Citrus latipes (MNSF), Castanopsis tribuloides (MTSF), Castanopsis armata (NBSF), Myrica esculenta (NKSF) and Taxus wallichiana (MKSF). SFs were characterized by high diversity and low dominance as seen in old-growth forests. Shannon's diversity index (H ') in the SFs ranged from 2.06 to 4.28 indicating high tree diversity, while in CFs it was 0.76-2.61 reflecting relatively lower diversity. Simpson's dominance index for trees was higher in CFs (0.09-0.73) than the SFs (0.02-0.26).

We found that several of the species diversity indices were closely related to ground-water level, suggesting that the ground-water level played a dominant role in determining plant species diversity in the lower reaches of the Tarim River. The ground-water level was low in the lower reaches of the Tarim River, and displayed a descending gradient from the upper to the lower reaches. The low ground-water level was apparently one of the major attributes to the low plant species diversity; the Shannon Weiner index was found to vary in a range from 0.53 to 1.93, and the Simpson index from 0.35 to 0.82. Plant species became less diverse, the structure of plant communities became simpler, and the diversity and abundance indices of the plant species decreased moving from the upper to the lower reaches of the Tarim River, corresponding to declining ground-water level. Our results indicated severe impacts of water stress on ecosystems of this and region due to low ground-water level and scarce rainfall. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The biological development of weeds in the cover crop before incorporation to the potato field was strongly limited. According to the data obtained, cover crop for green manure and mechanical soil tillage in the organic potato field were effective practices for controlling the weed infestation. The effect of organic practices on the weed community parameters were assessed by eco- logical indexes (Shannon index (H'), Shannon-Wiener evenness index (J'), index of dominance (Simpson dominance index , D) and similarity indexes (Sorensen similarity index, SSI). Results show that the studied three-field crop rotation included winter wheat, green bean, peas and rye mixture as cover crops and potato is a strategic scheme for achieving good weed control at the end of the rotation. The comparison of similarity of weed communities in a potato field between 2012 and 2013 using S?rensen indices shows that the similarity was higher on the base of the qualitative index (35.3%) than of the quantitative ones (20.8%).																			1310-0351					JUN	2020	26	3					507	512																WOS:000547563100003
J	Li, JM; Jin, ZX; Yu, BB				Li, Junmin; Jin, Zexin; Yu, Binbin			Changes in the structure and diversity of bacterial communities during the process of adaptation to organic wastewater	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												To explore changes in the structure and diversity of activated sludge-derived microbial communities during adaptation to gradual increases in the concentration of wastewater, RAPD PCR and the combination of PCR amplification of 16S rRNA genes with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis were used. In bacterial communities exposed to 0%, 5%, 10%, 20%, or 40% wastewater, there were 27, 25, 18, 17 and 16 bands, respectively, based on DGGE data, while there were 69, 83, 97, 86, and 88 bands, respectively, based on RAPD data. The community similarity index among bacterial communities during the process of adaptation to different concentrations of wastewater was different based on DGGE and RAPD data. Based on DGGE and RAPD profiles, the Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's diversity indices decreased sharply upon exposure to 10% wastewater, indicating that 10% wastewater might be a critical point at which the growth of bacteria could be significantly inhibited and the genotypic diversity could change. This indicated that changes in structure and diversity might have an inhibitory effect on the toxicity of organic matter and that selection and adaptation could play important roles in the changes.																			0008-4166	1480-3275				APR	2010	56	4					352	355		10.1139/W10-009	http://dx.doi.org/10.1139/W10-009								20453903					WOS:000278774600010

Assessments of physico-chemical parameters of Garaet Hadj Tahar wetland and their effect on waterbirds settlement	UKRAINIAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												This topic presented the relationship between physicochemical parameters and waterbirds assembling at Garaet Hadj Tahar (occidental Numidia, northeast of Algeria). Our data were collected from January 2018 to December 2018. Five physical parameters and four nutrient parameters, were measured at this wetland. We have noted 35 waterbirds species belonging to eleven family. All waterbirds of this wetland listed as least concern according to IUCN red list, except the three Anatidae key species with a conservation statuts: Aythya nyroca (near threatned), Oxyura leucocephala (endangered species) and Marmaronetta angustirostris (vulnerable). The maximum values of abundance, species richness, Shannon diversity index and Simpson diversity index were noted in wintering period but not for the Pielou's evenness index. Only five physicochemical parameters influenced the waterbirds population assembling at this wetland. Garaet Hadj Tahar wetland must getting more conservation interest and surveys in order to maintain the biodiversity of this hotspot wetland.																			2520-2138						2020	10	2					33	39		10.15421/2020_60	http://dx.doi.org/10.15421/2020_60													WOS:000548309900006
J	Song, ZY; Liu, H				Song, Zhiying; Liu, Hui			The investigation of the association of pregnancy weight gain on maternal and neonatal gut microbiota composition and abundance using 16sRNA sequencing	BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH												ObjectiveTo investigate the association of pregnancy weight gain on gut microbiota in pregnant women and newborns.MethodsPregnant women who had regular antenatal check-ups and were hospitalised for delivery at Shanxi Maternal and Child Health Hospital from September 2020 to December 2020 were selected as the study subjects. They were divided into the normal pre-pregnancy weight-normal pregnancy weight gain group (N-NG group), the normal pregnancy weight-excessive pregnancy weight gain group (N-EG group), the pre-pregnancy overweight/obese-normal pregnancy weight gain group (O-NG group) and the pre-pregnancy overweight/obese-excessive pregnancy weight gain group (O-EG group). Faecal samples of the pregnant women before delivery (37-41(+ 6) weeks of gestation) and the first meconium samples of their newborns were collected, sequenced for 16S rRNA gut microbiota and analysed. The results of different gut microbiota were compared separately. chi 2 test, a one-way analysis of variance or the rank sum test were performed according to data type and distribution. The differences in the Alpha diversity between the groups were analysed using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. The differences in the Beta diversity between the groups were analysed using the Adonis method.ResultsA total of 126 pre-delivery faecal samples from pregnant women and the first faecal samples from their newborns were collected. Seven species with significant abundance differences between the maternal O-NG and N-EG groups and 27 species with significant abundance differences in the newborns were analysed by LEfSe. In the Alpha diversity analysis, the differences in the maternal observed species index and the Chao1 index were statistically significant (p < 0.05) when compared between the groups (O-EG group versus the O-NG group, N-EG group and N-NG group), and the differences in the Shannon index and Simpson index were not statistically significant (p > 0.05) when compared between the groups. The neonatal observed species index, Chao1 index, Shannon index and Simpson index showed statistically significant differences in the comparison between the N-EG and O-EG groups (p < 0.05). In the Beta diversity analysis, the maternal samples did not differ Significantly between the four groups (p > 0.05), while the neonatal samples differed Significantly between the N-EG and N-NG, O-NG, and O-EG groups (p < 0.05).ConclusionPregnancy weight gain affects the composition and abundance of maternal and neonatal gut microbiota species as well as the diversity of neonatal gut microbiota.																				1471-2393				FEB 13	2023	23	1							109	10.1186/s12884-022-05289-4	http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12884-022-05289-4								36782154					WOS:000932075500002

Diversity and structural composition of species in dipterocarp forests: a study from Fasiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary, Bangladesh	JOURNAL OF FORESTRY RESEARCH												Fasiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary is a protected area composed of tropical remnant rainforest that harbor substantial number of large, old Garjan (Dipterocarpus spp.) trees. The present study assessed composition, structure and diversity of the species in this protected area. A total of 32 trees species were recorded with DBH >= 11 cm belonging to 24 genera and 19 families. The forest is low in plant diversity as represented by Shannon-Wiener diversity and Simpson Dominance indices. Dipterocarpus turbinatus was the most dominant species with maximum relative density, frequency, dominance, and importance value index. Syzygium firmum and Tectona grandis followed in terms of dominance. The structural composition indicated higher number of individuals in the medium growth classes (41 to < 511 cm DBH and 16-20 m height ranges), whereas D. turbinatus was the only species that dominated most of the growth classes. Poor stem density in lower growth classes indicated meager recruitment of regeneration which may be due to lower annual precipitation, increased grazing and encroachments. This study will help to understand the patterns of tree species composition and diversity in the remnant dipterocarp forests of Bangladesh. It will also contribute to identifying threatened plants to undertake D. turbinatus based conservation and sustainable management of the Fasiakhali Wildlife Sanctuary.

The loss in cultivar diversity is mainly attributed to land pressure, agricultural intensification, market demands, pests and diseases and civil unrest. Knowledge on the current Musa cultivar diversity across Rwanda, Burundi and eastern DR Congo will provide valuable information to breeders and taxonomists. This study assessed the on-farm and community level Musa germplasm diversity across different districts of Rwanda and Burundi, and across the South and North Kivu provinces of eastern DR Congo. Spatial diversity was computed using cultivar richness and the Gini-Simpson index of diversity. A total of 92 cultivars was recorded across the surveyed regions, with the highest number of cultivars observed in Rwanda and lowest in North Kivu. The mean number of cultivars across households varied from seven to eight. North Kivu had the highest diversity index, suggesting a more even distribution of plant populations among cultivars. For example, the two most predominant cultivars occupied 35% of the land area in North Kivu, 44% in Rwanda, 61% in Burundi and 70% in South Kivu. In addition, only 26% of the cultivars had a Gini-Simpson score greater than zero, i.e. were more uniformly spread and widely adapted. Hence, 74% of the cultivars, especially those with no cultural significance, are prone to genetic erosion; ex situ conservation would maintain these. Beer and cooking bananas dominate the Musa landscape. However, plantains gain importance in North Kivu, especially in the regions bordering the humid Congo basin and in Mutwanga -at the foothills of the Rwenzori mountain chain. The predominance of the AAA-EA highland banana subgroup can be attributed to the predominantly mid to high altitudes (>1500 masl) found in these regions. Mid to high altitudes support East African highland banana cultivars, while humid lowlands support the growth of plantains.

Solid-organ transplant recipients may display high rates of colonization and/or infection by multidrug-resistant bacteria. We analysed and compared the phenotypic and genotypic diversity of carbapenem-resistant (CR) strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from patients in the Solid Organ Transplantation department of our hospital. Methodology. Between March 2012 and August 2013, 56 CR strains from various biological fluids underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing with VITEK 2, molecular analysis by PCR amplification and genotypic analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). They were clustered according to antimicrobial drug susceptibility and genotypic profiles. Diversity analyses were performed by calculating Simpson's diversity index and applying computed rarefaction curves. Results/Key findings. Among K. pneumoniae, KP-producers predominated (57.1 %). VIM and OXA-23 carbapenemases prevailed among P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii (89.4 and 88.9 %, respectively). KPC-producing K. pneumoniae and OXA-23 A. baumannii were assigned in single PFGE pulsotypes. VIM-producing P. aeruginosa generated multiple pulsotypes. CR K. pneumoniae strains displayed phenotypic diversity in tigecycline, colistin (CS), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin (GEN) and co-trimoxazole (SXT) (16 clusters); P. aeruginosa displayed phenotypic diversity in cefepime (FEP), ceftazidime, aztreonam, piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, AMK, GEN and CS (9 clusters); and A. baumannii displayed phenotypic diversity in AMK, GEN, SXT, FEP, tobramycin and rifampicin (8 clusters). The Simpson diversity indices for the interpretative phenotype and PFGE analysis were 0.89 and 0.6, respectively, for K. pneumoniae strains (P<0.001); 0.77 and 0.6 for P. aeruginosa (P=0.22); and 0.86 and 0.19 for A. baumannii (P=0.004). Conclusion. The presence of different antimicrobial susceptibility profiles does not preclude the possibility that two CR K. pneumoniae or A. baumannii isolates are clonally related.

E-O-3 increased the values of the Shannon (43-80%) and Simpson (34-51%) indexes of the phyllo-and endo-spheric bacterial communities in NG5055. E-O-3 also increased the values of the phyllosphere Simpson index by 58% and the endosphere Shannon index by 54% in WYJ27. Both diversity indexes positively correlated with the contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, magnesium, and soluble sugar, and negatively correlated with the contents of starch and condensed tannins. The leaf-associated bacterial community composition significantly changed in both rice cultivars under E-O-3. Moreover, the leaf-associated bacterial communities in NG5055 were more sensitive to E-O-3 than those in WYJ27. The chemical properties explained 70% and 98% of variations in the phyllosphere and endosphere bacterial communities, respectively, suggesting a predominant role of chemical status for the endospheric bacterial community. Most variation (57.3%) in the endosphere bacterial community assembly was explained by phosphorus. Gammaproteobacteria and Pantoea were found to be the most abundant class (63-76%) and genus (38-48%) in the phyllosphere and endosphere, respectively. E-O-3 significantly increased the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the phyllosphere bacterial community and decreased the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in the endophytic community. In conclusion, elevated O-3 increased the diversity of bacterial communities of leaf phyllosphere and endosphere, and leaf chemical properties had a more pronounced effect on the endosphere bacterial community.					liu, yuanyuan/HSG-8372-2023; Agathokleous, Evgenios/D-2838-2016; liu, 园园/HJI-4438-2023; liu, yuanyuan/IQS-2755-2023; liu, yuanyuan/GWZ-5838-2022	Agathokleous, Evgenios/0000-0002-0058-4857; Cheng, Cheng/0000-0002-6179-4882													0048-9697	1879-1026				2022 JUL 15	2022	830								154705	10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154705	http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.154705		MAR 2022						35318051					WOS:000804454700013

The overall frequency of virulence increased on differentials possessing resistance genes Lr1, Lr2a, Lr3, and Lr26 and decreased on Lr17, Lr21, and Lr30. Genes Lr9 and Lr24 were resistant, while Lr18 was susceptible (98% in 1996) to all tested leaf rust isolates and Lr10 and Lr23 were susceptible to more than 78% of the isolates. Diversity between populations (years) was assessed using Kosman's H-KB (based on degrees of similarity among distinct phenotypes) and H-KDis (based on frequencies of individual virulences) and Nei's and Rogers' distances. The greatest difference occurred between the 1993 and 1994 populations. Phenotypic diversity within each population (year) was analyzed using the Shannon's, Simpson's, and Kosman's indices. The highest diversity within years was recorded in 1994 and significantly increased from 1993 to 1994 for all indices. The variance in the diversity between populations can be only partially explained by differences between corresponding diversities within population. The comparative analysis of diversity between and within populations over the 5 years enabled a detailed study of changes in the pathogen population. The results show that the different measures do not yield the same rank order of diversity.

J	Karydis, M; Tsirtsis, G				Karydis, M; Tsirtsis, G			Ecological indices: A biometric approach for assessing eutrophication levels in the marine environment	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT												The efficiency of 12 ecological indices expressing species diversity, abundance, evenness, dominance and biomass of phytoplankton to describe trophic levels in coastal marine ecosystems in the Eastern Mediterranean was assessed. The phytoplankton data were derived from three reference data sets characterising different trophic levels: (a) from inshore Saronikos Gulf waters characterising eutrophication; (b) from offshore waters of Saronikos Gulf representing mesotrophic conditions; and (c) from the oligotrophic offshore waters of the Island of Rhodes, Aegean Sea. Some of the commonly used indices such as the Simpson's, Shannon's and Margalef's indices seemed to be unsuitable for identifying eutrophic trends. On the other hand, the Menhinick's index, Kothe's index, Species Evenness, Species Number and Total Number of Individuals were found effective for distinguishing oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic waters, the most efficient being the Kothe's and Species Number indices. These indices were used to propose a classification scheme for characterising oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic waters in the Eastern Mediterranean. The experimental approach described in the present work can be used for water characterization in any waterbody, provided there are data available for setting up standard datasets that can define reference conditions.

In this study, spatial and temporal characteristics of the community structures of Zooplankton in the Luanjiaoyang Seas, Ningbo were described, including diversity index and environmental factors by using quantitative and qualitative methods. Sampling was carried out in December 2011 and in April, July, and October 2012. The results showed that of 104 species, Copepods, Protozoa and Planktonic larvaeas accounted for 53, 18 and 14 species respectively. The species number was at a maximum in summer and at a minimum in spring and this abundance applied to sites near the coast, the farther coast sites and the farthest coast sites. The results showed that the pattern of the community was significantly different, and the differences in the community were beyond 75%. The Margalef richness index (d) ranged from 0.32 to 1.17 (average 0.83); the Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H') range from 1.92 to 3.74 (average 2.74); the Pielou evenness index (J) ranged from 1.21 to 1.39 (average 1.28); while the Simpson index (D) averaged 0.80.

J	Zolda, P				Zolda, P			Nematode communities of grazed and ungrazed semi-natural steppe grasslands in Eastern Austria	PEDOBIOLOGIA												Soil nematode communities were investigated at eight semi-natural steppe grasslands in the National. Park Seewinkel, eastern Austria. Four sites were moderately grazed by horses, cattle and donkeys, four were ungrazed. Nematodes were sampled on four occasions from mineral soil, and their total abundance, diversity of genera, trophic structure and functional guilds were determined. Altogether 58 nematode genera inhabited the grasslands, with Acrobeloides, Anaplectus, Heterocephalobus, Prismatolaimus, Aphelenchoides, Aphelenchus, Tylenchus and Pratylenchus dominating. Mean total abundance at sites was 185-590 individuals per 100 g soil. Diversity indices did not separate communities well, but cluster analysis showed distinct site effects on nematode generic structure. Within feeding groups the relative proportion of bacterial-feeding nematodes was the highest, followed by the fungal- and plant-feeding group. Omnivores and predators occurred in low abundance. The maturity indices and plant parasite indices were characteristic for temperate grasslands, but the abundance of early colonizers (c-p 1 nematodes) was low. A high density of fungal-feeding c-p 2 families (Aphelenchoidae, Aphelenchoididae) resulted in remarkably high channel index values, suggesting that decomposition pathways are driven by fungi. Nematode community indices of all sites pointed towards a structured, non-enriched soil food web. At most sites, grazing showed little or no effect on nematode community parameters, but total abundance was higher at ungrazed areas. Significant differences in the percentage of omnivorous nematodes, the sum of the maturity index, the number of genera and Simpson's index of diversity were found at one long-term grazed pasture, and this site was also separated by multi-dimensional scaling (MDS).

J	Pitkänen, S				Pitkänen, S			Classification of vegetational diversity in managed boreal forests in eastern Finland	PLANT ECOLOGY												Diversity of vegetation in managed forests is studied. A classification based on forest stand structure, the abundances of vegetation species and variations in these abundances is developed and diversity indices are calculated for the classes to describe the diversity of the vegetation within the classes. The classes were formed using detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), global nonmetric multidimensional scaling (GNMDS) and TWINSPAN classification. Discriminant analysis was used to determine the environmental variables differentiating between the classes, and Duncan's multiple range test was used to examine the ability of the diversity measures to distinguish the classes. Beta diversity was estimated with Okland's method based on DCA ordination of the sample plots. The results point to fertility and the successional stage of the stand as the main factors affecting species diversity, in addition to which soil type, the number of tree species, crown cover, basal area and certain variables describing the management of the stand were relevant to the classification. The most distinct diversity indices were the reciprocal of Simpson, Pielou's J' and species richness, while the highest alpha diversity was found in young stands with a low crown cover on herb-rich or mesic forest sites. Beta diversity was quite high, its highest values of all for the whole data being recorded along the fertility gradient.																			1385-0237	1573-5052				JAN	2000	146	1					11	28		10.1023/A:1009877403926	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009877403926													WOS:000085307800002

Soil microbes are considered to be involved in biodegradation processes. However, the study of microbe diversity in soil mulched with biodegradable plastic film remains limited. Here, we compared the diversity of microbes between soils with biodegradable film and nonbiodegradable film (NBDF) mulch. The results showed that BDFs affected total C, P and NH4+-N, especially organism C content, as well as microbe species richness (ACE; Chao1) and diversity (Simpson index; Shannon index). In terms of dominant phyla and genera, BDFs and NBDF can influence the abundance of disparate species. Furthermore, BDFs could also contribute to improving the richness of the important functional bacterial groups in soil, e.g., Pedomicrobium and Comamonas, both of which are involved in the degradation of plastic residues in soil. Finally, we found that BDFs improved the transformation of nitrogen by significantly increasing the abundances of Nitrobacter and Nitrospira. Our results highlight the impact of BDF mulch on the abundance of functional bacteria in the soil.																			0302-8933	1432-072X				MAR	2022	204	3							195	10.1007/s00203-022-02799-9	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00203-022-02799-9								35217920					WOS:000761977100001

However, the addition of organic residues in soil management systems is a factor that may influence the soil biota. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of dose application of liquid swine manure on soil biota in different cropping systems. The study was conducted in the experimental area located in the Taquarucu do Sul. The design was a randomized block factorial arrangement (2x5), two soil management (minimum and no tillage) and five doses (0, 20, 40, 80 m(3) ha(-1) of liquid swine slurry and chemical fertilizer - ROLAS) with four replications. Sampling of soil biota was carried out with PROVID traps in plots of 22.5m(2). It was evaluated the total group, springtails, mites, abundance, richness, Simpson's index, Shannon's diversity and Pielou's index. The results indicate that no tillage system associated with 40 and 80 m(3) ha(-1) resulted in a greater abundance of organisms, caused by the greater number of springtails. The mite population is larger in minimum tillage compared to no tillage at a rate of 80 m(3) ha(-1). In no-tillage increases the dominance of Simpson and Shannon diversity decreases with increasing levels of liquid swine manure.

Afforestation could convert new lands from agriculture or urban land uses to reduce erosion and lead to landscape alterations and biodiversity changes. Here, we examined the changes in the three facets of macroinvertebrate alpha diversity (i.e., taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity) and further explored possible mechanisms driving their variations before (2007) and after (2016) afforestation along the undammed Chishui River, the core of the National Nature Reserve of Rare and Endemic Fishes in the Upper Yangtze River. We found that taxonomic diversity measures (e.g., species richness, Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson index) increased but all measures of functional diversity (e.g., FRic, FEve, FDiv, and RaoQ) and phylogenetic diversity (e.g., indices of taxonomic distinctness) exhibited stability after the afforestation practice. We also found that only significant taxonomic diversity variation was detected and it showed a relationship to alterations of land use rather than local environmental condition changes across the 10-year afforestation practice. Moreover, hydrology and nutrients levels showed changes after afforestation, but these changes had no effect on the biodiversity changes based on multiple linear regression models. In each survey, the three facets of alpha diversity were significantly explained by natural physical factors and showed inconsistent responses to these underlying environmental variables. In addition, the biodiversity-environment relationships remained stable before and after afforestation, indicating that the inherent mechanisms that drive macroinvertebrate community variation have not changed. Our findings highlight that different alpha diversity measures of lotic macroinvertebrates provide different information about biodiversity and respond differently to various environmental variables. Thus, it is necessary to integrate them into one framework when applying routine monitoring, assessment, and conservation procedures based on lotic macroinvertebrates.

This glacial period is typified by generally cold and dry conditions in the western Mediterranean region. Despite the relatively large number of pollen and speleothem studies of MIS 6 in this region, the number of MIS 6 archaeological sites is low. Lazaret cave, situated at 26 m a.s.l. in the city of Nice in southern France, contains an archaeological sequence (layers CII inf. to CIII) dated to MIS 6. We present a multi-method approach using the small-vertebrate assemblages (mainly rodents and herpetofauna) from the entire sequence to characterize the climate and the environment of the site. The Mutual Ecogeographic Range, the Bioclimatic Model andthe Quantified Ecology methods, as well as the Taxonomic Habitat Index, Climatograms and the Simpson Diversity Index were used to reconstruct the palaeoenvironmental and palaeoclimatic conditions. The results suggest a generally cold climate with a relatively humid environment and a landscape dominated by deciduous temperate forests. The findings are consistent with the general trends reported from other proxies (large mammals, birds and marine gastropods) studied at Lazaret cave, other MIS 6 sites in the Mediterranean region with small vertebrate studies and the general trends shown by marine cores, terrestrial pollen sequences and speleothems from western Europe. Given the scarcity of data for MIS 6 archaeological sites, Lazaret cave constitutes an important site for our knowledge of the climate and the environment of this period.

J	Carusi, C; Bianchi, G				Carusi, Chiara; Bianchi, Giuseppe			A look at interdisciplinarity using bipartite scholar/journal networks	SCIENTOMETRICS												In this paper, we propose new means to quantify journals' interdisciplinarity by exploiting the bipartite relation between scholars and journals where such scholars do publish. Our proposed approach is entirely data-driven (i.e., unsupervised): we just rely on the spectral properties of the bipartite bibliometric network, without requiring any a-priory classification or labeling of scholars or journals. Our approach is based on two subsequent steps. First, the structure of the bipartite graph is used to co-cluster both journals and scholars in a same low-dimensional space. Then, we measure a journal's interdisciplinarity by computing various diversity metrics (Shannon entropy, Simpson diversity, Rao-Stirling index) over the journal's distance with respect to these clusters. The proposed approach is evaluated over a dataset comprising 1258 journals and 2570 scholars in the information and communication technology field.																			0138-9130	1588-2861				FEB	2020	122	2					867	894		10.1007/s11192-019-03309-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03309-3													WOS:000511927600005

FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE												Clonal Hematopoiesis (CH) is a common, age-related phenomenon of growing scientific interest, due to its association with hematologic malignancy, cardiovascular disease and decreased overall survival. CH is commonly attributed to the preferential outgrowth of a mutant hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) with enhanced fitness, resulting in clonal imbalance. In-depth understanding of the relation between HSC clonal dynamics, CH and hematologic malignancy requires integration of fundamental lineage tracing studies with clinical data. However, this is hampered by lack of a uniform definition of CH and by inconsistency in the analytical methods used for its quantification. Here, we propose a conceptual and analytical framework for the definition and measurement of CH. First, we transformed the conceptual definition of CH into the CH index, which provides a quantitative measure of clone numbers and sizes. Next, we generated a set of synthetic data, based on the beta-distribution, to simulate clonal populations with different degrees of imbalance. Using these clonal distributions and the CH index as a reference, we tested several established indices of clonal diversity and (in-)equality for their ability to detect and quantify CH. We found that the CH index was distinct from any of the other tested indices. Nonetheless, the diversity indices (Shannon, Simpson) more closely resembled the CH index than the inequality indices (Gini, Pielou). Notably, whereas the inequality indices mainly responded to changes in clone sizes, the CH index and the tested diversity indices also responded to changes in the number of clones in a sample. Accordingly, these simulations indicate that CH can result not only by skewing clonal abundancies, but also by variation in their overall numbers. Altogether, our model-based approach illustrates how a formalized definition and quantification of CH can provide insights into its pathogenesis. In the future, use of the CH index or Shannon index to quantify clonal diversity in fundamental as well as clinical clone-tracing studies will promote cross-disciplinary discussion and progress in the field.

J	Kapuria, P				Kapuria, Preeti			Limits to sustainable fish catch: the case of marine fishery in Kerala	ENVIRONMENT AND DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS												This study aims to examine the interannual variation in fish biomass and to estimate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) for the marine fisheries of Kerala, India. Although the productivity of a fishery is known to be dependent on species diversity, this relationship is not widely documented. This paper uses an extended Gordon-Schaefer model that is modified to incorporate species diversity to estimate the MSY levels of catch and the corresponding fishing effort. Species diversity is expressed as both biological and bioeconomic diversity using the Simpson index. The model reports that the actual fishing effort has exceeded the maximum level necessary to support sustainable yield, while the maximum level of catch for maintaining sustainable yield is not known. A comparison of fish landings and effort data across different fishing techniques indicates that there is a potential to decrease the current level of fishing effort without experiencing a significant decline in fish catch.																			1355-770X					OCT	2011	16		5				621	638		10.1017/S1355770X11000039	http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1355770X11000039													WOS:000295223300005
J	Wong, MC; Dowd, M				Wong, Melisa C.; Dowd, Michael			Patterns in Taxonomic and Functional Diversity of Macrobenthic Invertebrates Across Seagrass Habitats: a Case Study in Atlantic Canada	ESTUARIES AND COASTS												Functional diversity (FD) characterizes the role of species within communities based on their morphological, behavioural and life history traits. Taxonomic diversity is not always a surrogate for FD, and ecosystem functioning is more dependent on functional traits rather than species richness. Despite this, most diversity studies in seagrass ecosystems do not consider the functional trait landscape. Here, we compare and contrast the taxonomic and functional diversity and composition of macrobenthic invertebrates (infauna and small epifauna) across a gradient of seagrass habitats (bare sediment, bed edge and bed interior) at three sites in Nova Scotia, Canada. We also determine the relationship between taxonomic diversity and FD to gain insight into the consequences of species loss. At two sites, we found that taxonomic diversity (species number and Margalef and Simpson's indices) increased from bare sediments to the bed interior, while FD (Rao index) did not or else showed a weaker pattern. At a third site, both taxonomic and functional diversity tended to increase across the seagrass gradient. Despite the differences in relationships between taxonomic and functional diversity, functional trait composition tended to be distinct across seagrass habitats at all sites. Regressions showed that FD increased either hyperbolically or linearly with taxonomic diversity. Our study suggests that for seagrass ecosystems similar to the ones sampled, the implications of species loss for ecosystem functioning may not be easily predicted from data of taxonomic diversity alone. This study provides some of the first data of taxonomic and functional diversity in seagrass ecosystems, which can be used to inform conservation objectives and management practices.																			1559-2723	1559-2731				NOV	2015	38	6					2323	2336		10.1007/s12237-015-9967-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-015-9967-x													WOS:000362580300036

Herbaceous Plant Diversity and Identification of Indicator Species in Olive Groves in Central Greece	COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS												The present study is aimed at assessing the herbaceous plant diversity and determining the specific species related to different management systems in olive grove ecosystems [organic, conventional (unsprayed), and conventional (sprayed)] in two sites (Nies and Pteleos) of Magnesia Prefecture (central Greece). The sampling of herbaceous vegetation was carried out in randomly selected plots of 0.25 m(2) (0.5 mx0.5 m) each. The results showed that the organic system in Pteleos favored plant species richness and Shannon-Weiner, Simpson, Margalef, Brilluin, McIntosh, and Menhinick indexes more than the other management systems (P < 0.05). A Renyi diagram revealed the greatest plant diversity in the organic system in Pteleos site. According to cluster analysis results, the organic and the conventional (unsprayed) olive groves in Pteleos exhibited a strong similarity regarding plant diversity. The same was detected in the pairs: Nies conventional (unsprayed) and Nies organic, and in Nies conventional (sprayed) and Pteleos conventional (sprayed). IndVal analysis revealed three characteristic types of indices, Chenopodium album in the organic olive groves in Pteleos, Sinapis arvensis in the organic ones in Nies, and Aegilops geniculata in the conventional (unsprayed) olive groves in Nies.

The study looks at citations as import-export statistics reflecting intellectual influence. The principal findings include: there is little variability in both the number and diversity of imports, but great variability in both the number and diversity of exports and hence in the balance of trade; there is a tendency for influence to flow from theory to applications to a much greater extent than in the reverse direction; there is little communication between statistics and probability journals. The export scores model is introduced and employed to map a set of journals' bilateral intellectual influences onto a one-dimensional scale, and the Cox effect is identified as a phenomenon that can occur when a disciplinary paper attracts a large degree of attention from outside its discipline.																			0883-4237					FEB	1994	9	1					94	108		10.1214/ss/1177010655	http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/ss/1177010655													WOS:A1994NG28500005

We compared typing results obtained using a commercial repetitive-element PCR (rep-PCR) system with PFGE in a sample of 86 unique MRSA isolates recovered from subjects in an academic referral hospital and two nursing homes in the same geographic region. Both methods reliably assigned isolates to the same Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) pulsotype. PFGE was significantly more discriminatory (Simpson's index of diversity, 0.92 at the 95% strain similarity threshold) than the commercial rep-PCR system (Simpson's index of diversity, 0.58). The global (adjusted Rand coefficient, 0.10) and directional congruence (adjusted Wallace coefficient(repPCR -> PFGE) = 0.06; adjusted Wallace coefficient(PFGE -> repPCR) = 0.52) between the two methods was low. MRSA strains recovered from study nursing homes that were clonal when typed by the commercial rep-PCR method were frequently noted to be genetically distinct when typed using PFGE. These data suggest that the commercial rep-PCR has less utility than PFGE in small-scale epidemiological assessments of MRSA in health care settings.

QUANTIFYING BEETLE AND BIRD DIVERSITY IN A MEDITERRANEAN MOUNTAIN AGRO-ECOSYSTEM	ISRAEL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY & EVOLUTION												In cultivated landscapes, the peculiar mosaic structure creates several types of habitat. Defining which habitats favor rich biodiversity is of increasing importance. Beetle and bird diversity was monitored in seven different habitats (cereals, corn, fallow, Robinia pseudoacacia plantations, grassland, cultivation-oak forest ecotone, and oak forest) in central Greece aiming at (a) quantifying the alpha and beta diversity using biotic indicators, (b) evaluating species richness, (c) identifying the most important habitats for beetle and bird species assemblages, and (d) examining species generalism or specialism in habitat use. To assess the impact of habitat type on biodiversity we estimated the abundance (A), species richness (S), the Shannon diversity index (H'), the Simpson dominance index (D), and the Shannon evenness index (E'). During the sampling period a total of 21,647 individuals of ground-dwelling beetles were captured in pitfall traps, classified into 63 species, while 21 bird species were recorded as breeders. The maximum beetle abundance and diversity was observed in grassland, fallow, and cereals. The highest breeding bird density and diversity were recorded in ecotone and oak forest, with the lowest ones in fallow. Cluster analysis demonstrated that the species assemblages were classified into two categories, open agricultural and closed wooded, while following the "IndVal" analysis a set of three species were identified as characteristic species of a specific habitat type. Our findings indicated that agro-ecosystems can enhance the faunal diversity of mountainous landscapes, while specific habitat types can significantly influence the species composition.

Regarding its parasitofauna, only two species of parasites have been registered and, given so little information, a parasitological study was carried out on 80 specimens of S. peruviana sampled from the coast of Tumbes, north of Peru, between June and October 2018. The total length (TL) and sex of each fish were recorded. The ecological descriptors of parasitic infection/infestation, the degree of parasitic dispersal, the alpha diversity indices and the correlation the parasitological indices and biological characteristics of the fish (TL and sex) were calculated. Two species of monogeneans (Oaxacotyle oaxacensis and Metamicrocotyla macracantha), one species of trematode (Lecithocladium cristatum) and four species of copepods (Naobranchia sp., Lepeophtheirus sp., Caligus sp. and Lernanthropus sp.) were recorded. The monogenean O. oaxacensis was considered the only core species (e.g., with prevalence > 45%). The distribution found for O. oaxacensis and L. cristatum was aggregated and there was no association between TL and sex with the parasitological indices. In the case of alpha diversity indices, Margalef (D-mg), Shannon-Weaver (H ') and Pielou (J ') diversity index values were higher in females, but Simpson dominance (D) did not show differences between sexes. The diversity index of parasitic H' showed a higher value in the sizes over sexual maturity of S. peruviana. The parasitic D index presented an opposite pattern.

They host hundreds of flora and fauna species, and numerous types of habitat of conservational interest. They also provide a variety of ecosystem services. Over the last few decades, the two lakes have been interconnected through a surface water channel. In an attempt to explore whether such a management practice might alter the ecological properties of the two lakes, we investigated a series of community metrics for phytoplankton by emphasizing cyanobacteria. Our results demonstrate that the cyanobacterial metacommunity structure was affected by directional hydrological connectivity and high dispersal rates, and to a lesser extent, by cyanobacterial species sorting. Cyanobacterial alpha diversity was twofold in the shallow upstream Lake Mikri Prespa (Simpson index average value: 0.70) in comparison to downstream Lake Megali Prespa (Simpson index average value: 0.37). The cyanobacterial assemblage of the latter was only a strict subset of that in Mikri Prespa. Similarly, beta diversity components clearly showed a homogenization of cyanobacteria, supporting the hypothesis that water flow enhances fluvial translocation of potentially toxic and bloom-forming cyanobacteria. Degrading of the water quality in the Lake Megali Prespa in anticipation of improving that of the Lake Mikri Prespa is an issue of great concern for the Prespa lakes' protection and conservation.

Mining and characterization of microsatellites from a genome of <i>Venturia carpophila</i>	MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS												A total of 4021 microsatellites were mined from a genome of Venturia carpophila, and 192 were selected to screen 39 isolates of the fungus collected from peach and nectarine in the southeastern USA. Of the 192 selected, 32 primers consistently and reliably produced polymorphic amplicons. Subsequently, the genotyping data from these 32 primers were used for preliminary analysis of the genetic diversity among the 39 isolates. The number of alleles identified ranged from 2 to 9, and the polymorphic information content from 0.097 to 0.792. Over all isolates, Shannon's information index was 0.914, indicating genetic diversity. Stoddart and Taylor's index of diversity and Simpson's index also indicated high diversity (32.4 and 0.969, respectively). Evenness within the sample was high (0.955), but there was strong evidence for haploid linkage disequilibrium (3.799, P = 0.001). Observations on diversity were supported by analysis of genetic distance, which showed little affinity for clustering based on isolate source population, location, or host.

Taken together, all the TEs in a genome form a diverse community of sequences, which can be studied to draw conclusions about genome evolution. TE diversity can be measured using models for ecological community diversity that consider species richness and evenness. Several models predict TE diversity decreasing as genomes expand because of selection against ectopic recombination and/or competition among TEs to garner host replicative machinery and evade host silencing mechanisms. Salamanders have some of the largest vertebrate genomes and highest TE loads. Salamanders of the genus Plethodon, in particular, have genomes that range in size from 20 to 70 Gb. Here, we use Oxford Nanopore sequencing to generate low-coverage genomic sequences for four species of Plethodon that encompass two independent genome expansion events, one in the eastern clade (Plethodon cinereus, 29.3 Gb vs. Plethodon glutinosus, 38.9 Gb) and one in the western clade (Plethodon vehiculum, 46.4 Gb vs Plethodon idahoensis, 67.0 Gb). We classified the TEs in these genomes and found > 40 TE superfamilies, accounting for 22-27% of the genomes. We calculated Simpson's and Shannon's diversity indices to quantify overall TE diversity. In both pairwise comparisons, the diversity index values for the smaller and larger genome were almost identical. This result indicates that, when genomes reach extremely large sizes, they maintain high levels of TE diversity at the superfamily level, in contrast to predictions made by previous studies on smaller genomes.																			0022-2844	1432-1432				2022 OCT	2022	90	5					332	341		10.1007/s00239-022-10063-3	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00239-022-10063-3		JUN 2022						35751655					WOS:000815552500001

In order to evaluate the effects and mechanisms of different grazing management systems on the scale dependency of species diversity, plant community indices and soil variables were determined in 32 plots in the Qilian Mountains in Gansu Province. The results show that diversity effects and their regulating mechanisms had space-scale dependence under different grazing management systems. The species richness and species diversity indices of RG grassland were significantly higher than those of GE at the regional scale. Species richness for RG and GE plots was 128 and 98, respectively, and the Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indices for RG and GE plots were 2.26 and 2.16, and 0.85 and 0.83, respectively. Additionally, three grazing management systems had a significant effect on species richness in mountain meadows, but different management systems had significantly different effects on species diversity indices in mountain meadows and temperate steppes. Meanwhile, soil variables only influenced species diversity at the regional scale. Most of the plant and soil variables at each scale had positive effects on species diversity. However, a negative correlation was seen between biodiversity and species coverage, mean plant height, soil porosity (SP) and bulk density (BD) under the two contrasting grazing management systems. In conclusion, choosing RG at the regional scale and selecting grazing management systems according to different grassland types at the local scale can help to restore degraded grassland vegetation.

The analysis of this relationship aims to support improvements in the production management of tilapia. For this purpose, a total of 100 juvenile fishes (Oreochromis spp.) and 30 water samples were collected at Valle del Mezquital in the Central-Eastern socioeconomical region of Mexico. A study of parasite biodiversity was carried out and water quality parameters were determined. Biodiversity in the habitat was measured using the Simpson diversity index, which considers the number of species present and the abundance of each one; we also calculate the Berger-Parker index to estimate the proportional importance of the most abundant species. In general, it was found that 86% of the examined specimens were parasitized. Parasite biodiversity was 11 genera (Simpson index = 0.55). Trichodina spp. (Ciliophora) was the dominant genus (Berger-Parker index = 0.51). The protozoa Apiosoma spp. was associated with the water hardness (Berger-Parker index = 0.57). Furthermore, the presence of monogeneans showed a positive correlation with the levels of nitrites and ammonium in the water (Berger-Parker index = 0.06-0.55). This characterization may represent a useful tool in the comprehensive management of parasites that affect the farmed tilapia. However, new data is necessary to expand the knowledge about the environment-host-parasite relationship.

A study was carried out in an agricultural watershed of Thailand to document plant species richness of different agricultural land uses and to assess its relationship with biomass and soil erosion. A nested sampling design of 20 x 20 m, 10 x 10 m, 5 x 5 m and 1 x 1 m quadrats was employed to study species richness of three categories of plants: herbaceous plants, shrubs and trees. Interviews were conducted with farmers who owned the cultivated fields where sampling plots were located. Plant diversity was assessed by computing Shannon index, Simpson index, and Species richness. Species utility index, which is the percentage of species identified as useful, was also estimated for each land use. Biomass was estimated using methodology recommended by FAO and soil erosion was estimated using the universal soil loss equation (USLE). From among the different land use types, mixed orchard ranked first in terms of plant diversity while paddy ranked last. Land uses with monocropping of shrubs, such as cassava, pineapple and sugarcane had lower plant diversity than land uses with monocropping of trees, such as coconut and para rubber. Monocropping of eucalyptus was an exception. Rotations of monocrops, namely pineapple-cassava and sugarcane-cassava, or intercropping, namely coconut-cassava, also had a higher plant diversity as compared to monocropping of shrubs. The highest species utility index of 61 was found in orchards, the lowest of 9 was found in Eucalyptus plantations. Plant diversity was found to have a significant positive correlation with biomass and a negative, though non-significant, correlation with soil erosion. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Diversity of Lepidoptera (Papilionoidea e Hesperioidea) in two fragments in Frederico Westphalen, Rio Grande do Sul State, Brazil	REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE ENTOMOLOGIA												A systematic survey was carried out in two localities of the Municipal District of Frederico Westphalen, fragment of Villa Faguense and Schoenstatt's Sanctuary, situated 1,500 in apart, from March 2005 to April 2006. In 140 hours of sampling, 3123 individuals, distributed in 169 species, were registered. Nymphalidae was the most sampled with approximately 53% of the recorded species. Nine species sampled were still no registered for the State. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index was higher in fragment of Villa Faguense, place less disturbed. The Simpson and Berger-Parker dominance indexes had been more representative in fragment of Schoenstatt Sanctuary, with higher number of abundant species.

An extensive inventory of rainforest trees in post-logging regrowth forest in the southern Philippines provided a rare opportunity to compare stem density, species richness, diversity and biotic similarity between two types of post-logging forests: broken-canopy forest fragments and adjacent tracts of closed-canopy 'contiguous' forest. Tree density was much lower in the fragments, but rarefied species richness was higher. 'Hill' numbers, computed as the exponential of Shannon's diversity index and the inverse of Simpson's diversity index, indicated that fragments have higher numbers of typical and dominant species compared to contiguous forest. Beta diversity (based on species incidence) and the exponential of Shannon's diversity index was higher in fragmented forest, indicating higher spatial species turnover than in contiguous forest samples. Lower mean values of the Chao-Jaccard index in fragmented forest compared to contiguous forest also indicated a lower probability of shared species across fragments. The high species richness of contiguous forest showed that an earlier single logging event had not caused biodiversity to be degraded leaving mostly generalist species. Fragmentation and further low-level utilisation by local farmers has also not caused acute degradation. Post-logging regrowth forest fragments present a window of opportunity for conservation that may disappear in a few years as edge effects become more apparent. For the conservation of trees in forests in south-east Asia generally, our findings also suggest that while conservation of remaining primary forest may be preferable, the conservation value of post-logging regrowth forests can also be high.

Despite its global significance in agriculture, ecosystems, and industry, few studies have focused on studying the diversity and distribution of this genus in Mexico. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to understand the diversity and distribution of Trichoderma species in Mexico, both in ecosystems and agroecosystems. For this systematic review, we used the PRISMA methodology. We reviewed forty-one scientific articles, two book chapters, and the GBIF database. We recorded a total of 1082 isolates, revealing the presence of 57 species of the genus Trichoderma in 29 states of Mexico. We found that species from the genus Trichoderma were reported in 20 agroecosystems and 6 ecosystems. T. harzianum was the predominant species in both agricultural and undisturbed soil. Tabasco and Veracruz were the states with the highest species diversity, with 20 and 14 species reported, respectively. Chiapas had the highest diversity indices (Menhinick had 3.20, Simpson had 0.89, and Margalef had 4.16). The coffee crop was the agroecosystem with the highest diversity, with 12 species reported. In the undisturbed ecosystems, tropical rainforests featured 12 different species. This study highlights the distribution of the genus Trichoderma as a cosmopolitan genus. We argue for the importance of the species that comprise the genus and its applications for social benefits.

A decade of diversity: using statistical indices to compare neurosurgery to other surgical specialties	NEUROSURGICAL FOCUS												OBJECTIVE Studies have demonstrated the benefits of diversity in neurosurgery. However, recruitment of minoritized groups within the neurosurgical workforce consistently lags other surgical specialties. While racial and gender demographics of neurosurgical residents are well documented, there has been minimal exploration into the multidimensional nature of diversity. The current study will evaluate the longitudinal diversity changes in neurosurgery residency programs compared with other surgical fields with validated diversity indices. METHODS Nationwide reports including data about resident physicians were obtained from the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges for the academic years 2008-2021. Self-reported race, biological sex, and medical school affiliation were recorded for surgical residents in the 10 commonly recognized surgical fields. The Gini-Simpson Diversity Index was used to calculate the effective counts (ECs) of races, sexes, and medical school types for each field. A Composite Diversity Index (CDI) comprising the aforementioned diversity traits was used to calculate the percentage of characteristics upon which two randomly selected residents within each specialty would differ. CDIs were calculated for each field in every year from 2008 to 2021. Median CDIs were compared between fields using Kruskal-Wallis testing, and p values < 0.05 were deemed statistically significant. RESULTS Plastic surgery had the highest median sex EC (1.92, interquartile range [IQR] 1.78-1.95), indicating greater diversity, while neurosurgery had the third lowest sex EC (1.40, IQR 1.35-1.41). All surgical fields examined had fewer than 3 races effectively represented among their residents, despite there being 8 races present. Neurosurgery ranked among the top fields in effective racial diversity (EC 2.17, IQR 2.09-2.21) and medical school type diversity (EC 1.25, IQR 1.21-1.26). There were statistically significant differences in the sex, race, and school ECs between surgical specialties. While neurosurgery had a relatively low median overall diversity (CDI = 32.7, IQR 32.0-34.6), there was a consistent longitudinal increase in CDI from 2015 to 2021. CONCLUSIONS Neurosurgery resident physicians have become increasingly diverse in the past decade but are more homogenous than residents in other surgical fields. The continued use of diversity indices to more accurately track diversity progress over time may better inform leaders in the field of how they may best focus their equity and inclusion efforts.

To measure vegetation information, the appropriate sampling plot size was determined based on the canopy cover of the dominant species of the study area (1 m2). Then, in each unit, sampling was done along 3 transects of 100 m. Along each transect, 10 plots with dimensions of one square meter were placed at a distance of 10 m from each other. In each plot, the type, life forms, frequency of plant species, and species density were recorded. Species diversity indices were calculated using Ecological Methodology software. The values obtained from these indicators were analyzed in SPSS 24 statistical software and using the F test. The results of the Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the highest values of the species diversity indices are in the middle altitudes (ecotone) class. ANOVA of the richness, evenness, and heterogeneity indices in different altitude classes showed that the values of the richness indices were not significant, but among the indices related to the heterogeneity, the Hill index and all the evenness indices were significant. Comparing the numerical indices of our communities enables us to determine the impact of environmental stress in a single community to choose the best habitat among a similar group for conservation. A community that has high diversity and richness is important for conservation. Therefore, the authorities must prevent the destruction of the vegetation of the study area in connection with the implementation of principled and correct management by the potential of the region, but also to reduce the pressure of livestock grazing and carry out corrective and restoration operations, to turn these rangelands towards rich diversity.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				DEC	2023	195	12							1555	10.1007/s10661-023-12165-x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-12165-x								38036716					WOS:001111190800004

DYNAMIC CHARACTERISTICS OF COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND SEASONAL VARIATION OF FISHERY SPECIES IN THE BOHAI SEA, CHINA	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The structural patterns and the seasonal dynamics of fishery species were studied in the Bohai Sea, based on fishery-independent data surveyed in each season sampling stations. A total of 88 fishery species belonging to 64 families were recorded, in detail 43 fishes, 29 crustaceans, 12 molluscas, three echinoderms and one species of scyphozoan. Among them, 21 species commonly found throughout the study period defined as 'common' species, and eight species those were the highest contributors defined as 'dominant' species (based on SIMPER analysis, their cumulative contribution was more than 70%). Maximum abundance was recorded in the summer season while species number was higher in both summer and autumn season. Among the community parameters, species richness (3.79), diversity (2.31) and Simpson indices (0.88) peaked in the autumn season whereas species evenness (0.95) was in the winter. However, species diversity, evenness, and Simpson indices were lower in the summer season (0.57, 0.18 and 0.18, respectively) while species richness was in the winter (1.65). Multivariate PCoA analysis revealed that there was a significant seasonal variation in fisheries assemblages. Furthermore, ANOSIM (Global R = 0.467, P = 0.01) indicated a distinct community structure of fishery species between the four seasons. Thus, this result suggests that fisheries assemblages might be influenced by the seasonal dynamics of the ecological condition of the Bohai Sea.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2020	18	1					817	837		10.15666/aeer/1801_817837	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1801_817837													WOS:000518377600054

Of these, 53.46% (193) were found to have wound infections. Most of the infected patients fell in the age group II (21-40 years). A total of 14 bacterial species were identified, with Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli being the most common Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respectively. Linezolid and vancomycin were the most effective antibiotics against the isolated Gram-positive bacteria, while most Gram-negative bacteria were sensitive against colistin and polymyxin-B. Based on antibiotic resistance, 129 types of resistance were detected. Multi-resistance was detected in 157 (81.3%) bacterial strains, while 162 strains had a multi-antibiotic resistance index (MAR) of 0.2. Simpson and Shannon diversity indices indicated high bacterial diversity in the wound samples. The study provides valuable insight into the prevalence of bacterial infections in wounds and that antibiotic resistance patterns can be useful in guiding the development of effective treatment strategies.																			0354-4664	1821-4339					2023	75	3					263	277		10.2298/ABS230313021I	http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ABS230313021I													WOS:001104161700005

Currently, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing technology has been increasingly used in biodiversity monitoring due to its flexibility and low cost. In this study, we compared two methods for estimating forest species diversity indices, namely the spectral angle mapper (SAM) classification approach based on the established species-spectral library, and the self-adaptive Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm by selected biochemical and structural features. We conducted this study in two complex subtropical forest areas, Mazongling (MZL) and Gonggashan (GGS) National Nature Forest Reserves using UAV-borne hyperspectral and LiDAR data. The results showed that the classification method performed better with higher values of R-2 than the clustering algorithm for predicting both species richness (0.62 > 0.46 for MZL and 0.55 > 0.46 for GGS) and Shannon-Wiener index (0.64 > 0.58 for MZL, 0.52 > 0.47 for GGS). However, the Simpson index estimated by the classification method correlated less with the field measurements than the clustering algorithm (R-2 = 0.44 and 0.83 for MZL and R-2 = 0.44 and 0.62 for GGS). Our study demonstrated that the classification method could provide more accurate monitoring of forest diversity indices but requires spectral information of all dominant tree species at individual canopy scale. By comparison, the clustering method might introduce uncertainties due to the amounts of biochemical and structural inputs derived from the hyperspectral and LiDAR data, but it could acquire forest diversity patterns rapidly without distinguishing the specific tree species.

J	Shan, XJ; Jin, XS; Yuan, W				Shan Xiujuan; Jin Xianshi; Yuan Wei			Taxonomic diversity of fish assemblages in the Changjiang Estuary and its adjacent waters	ACTA OCEANOLOGICA SINICA												Taxonomic diversity of fish assemblages in the Changjiang Estuary (Yangtze River Estuary) and its adjacent waters was analyzed based on bottom trawl surveys carried out by R/V Beidou in June, August and October 2006. Four groups of fishes were identified for each survey by the two-way indicator species analysis (TWIA). Taxonomic distinctness, species richness and phylogenetic diversity were used to detect changes in taxonomic structure of fish assemblages. Most dominant fish species mainly belonged to Perciformes, Pleuronectiformes, Clupeiformes, Scorpaeniformes and Tetraodontiformes. Species richness in offshore waters of the survey area was higher than that in the other area. The average taxonomic distinctness value (AvTD, Delta(+)) of each fish assemblage was close to the average taxonomic distinctness of master list in the Changjiang Estuary (79.9), and had a positive correlation with species richness and Shannon diversity index (H'). A negative correlation was found between variations in taxonomic distinctness (VarTD, Lambda(+)) and traditional diversity indices, which were caused by fish species component that led to longer average path lengths among species. Taxonomic diversity index (Delta) had the similar results with species richness, H', Simpson diversity index (D) and Pielou's evenness index (J'). VarTD also kept stable, which further certificated that fish assemblages and ecological environment were in equilibrium. Taxonomic distinctness index (Delta*) was relatively stable in most of fish assemblages, and had higher values in some fish assemblages for a few absolutely dominant species. The present study showed that fish community formed new equilibrium stability in 2006 in the Changjiang Estuary when compared with those in the corresponding months of annual survey from 1985 to 1986. And AvTD in each sampling station was lower than AvTD of master list in the Changjiang Estuary, so some ecological niches were absent in each sampling stations from taxonomic or phylogenetic relationships, these would be helpful to stock natural resource and maintain ecological equilibruim of fish assemblages.					yuan, lin/JDW-7387-2023														0253-505X	1869-1099				MAR	2010	29	2					70	80		10.1007/s13131-010-0024-0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13131-010-0024-0													WOS:000277095000009

The MFCs are operated under four different conditions which exhibited different characteristics of electricity generation. In batch mode, MFCs generate intermittently high current pulses in the beginning, and the current density is instable subsequently, while the current density of MFCs in continuous mode is relatively stable. All operational parameters show good capacity for substrate removal, and nitrogen and sulfate were the main reaction products. Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis is employed to obtain profiles of the bacterial communities present in inoculum and suspension of four MFCs. Based on the community diversity indices and Spearman correlation analyses, significant correlation exists between Richness of the community of anode chamber and the electricity generated, while no strong correlation is evident between other indexes (Shannon index, Simpson index and Equitability index) and the electricity. Additionally, the results of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) suggest that MFCs suffering from current shock have similar suspension communities, while the others have diverse microbial communities.

With a decrease of pH the number of phytoplankton species decreased especially among centric diatoms,blue-greens and Euglenophyta, total biomass of phytoplankton and its seasonal dispersion declined. Green algae, chrysomonades and cryptomonades biomass correlated negatively with pH but diatoms and blue-greens biomass were related positively to pH. The drop in pH produced a decrease of Shannon-Weaver diversity index, obtained from biomass and cell volume of algae, increase of Simpson index and algae size. The growth of phytoplankton did not correspond the total phosphorus. The necessary modifications to the structural characteristics of phytoplankton by the acidification came about in the pH range from 6 to 5. Copyright (C) 1996 IAWQ.

In addition, some physicochemical parameters that play important roles, such as temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH, were measured for each station. As a result, 31 fish species from 23 families were found at a total of 10 stations in depths of 30-1000 m. At each station, the Shannon-Weaver diversity index, Simpson dominance index, species richness index, and evenness index were estimated.

Temporal shifts in the biodiversity of nearshore small fishes in Lake Simcoe	JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH												Nearshore small fish species represent a large proportion of fish biodiversity in Lake Simcoe, a large inland lake in southern Ontario, Canada. Over the past 30 years, Lake Simcoe has experienced several changes to its aquatic habitat, benthic invertebrate communities and predatory fish populations. This study compared samples of the nearshore small fish community in three geographic areas of Lake Simcoe. Fish community data were grouped into two time periods: a contemporary period (2007-2009) and a historical period (1982-1995). The fish community was compared across time periods for each area to assess if observed ecological changes had an impact on the small fish community. Species richness significantly declined between time periods in two areas (Cook's Bay and the southeast shoreline), the number of individuals captured declined between time periods in one area of the lake (Kempenfelt Bay) and Simpson's diversity index declined between time periods in one area of the lake (southeast shoreline). There were no significant differences in the Shannon-Weiner evenness index between time periods in any of the study areas. Additional analyses of intra- and inter-annual variation in fish sampling results generally supported the findings that shifts in the fish community occurred between time periods. Overall, this study suggests that the nearshore small fish biodiversity of lake Simcoe has shifted over time but these shifts are not clearly related to recent increases in water clarity, macrophyte growth and nearshore benthic invertebrate densities.

J	Wang, MY; Lu, N; An, NN; Fu, BJ				Wang, Mengyu; Lu, Nan; An, Nannan; Fu, Bojie			Plant Functional and Phylogenetic Diversity Regulate Ecosystem Multifunctionality in Semi-Arid Grassland During Succession	FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE												The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) is crucial for understanding the processes of ecological restoration in semi-arid regions. However, partitioning the relative influence of various biodiversity attributes, namely taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, on EMF during secondary succession is still unclear. This study aimed to bridge the gap by employing field measurements and the chronosequence approach at 21 plots with different stand ages and precipitation conditions on the Loess Plateau of China. For diversity indices, we calculated the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson's dominance index, Pielou evenness index, community weighted mean (CWM), functional variance (FDvar), and Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PD) based on the empirically measured composition and traits of plant species. The EMF was expressed as the averaged value of eight function variables (including aboveground biomass, root biomass, soil total carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus content, soil organic carbon, available nitrogen and available phosphorus content). The results showed that species evenness and CWM of leaf dry matter content (LDMC) significantly increased yet the CWM of specific leaf area (SLA) decreased with stand age, indicating the resource-use strategy of the plants became more conservative through succession into its later stages. The EMF increased with both stand age and mean annual precipitation. The structural equation model revealed that stand age, soil water content (SWC), and the multiple diversity indices altogether accounted for 56.0% of the variation in the EMF. PD and the CWMs of plant height and LDMC had positive effects on the EMF, and the FDvar of leaf nitrogen had negative effects on EMF. However, the Shannon Wiener diversity had no significant effect on the EMF. Our results suggest that functional and phylogenetic diversity are more important than taxonomic diversity in predicting EMF, and that multidimensional biodiversity indices should be jointly considered to better predict EMF during the succession of semiarid grasslands.

Correlations between phylogenetic and functional diversity: mathematical artefacts or true ecological and evolutionary processes?	JOURNAL OF VEGETATION SCIENCE												Questions: Is phylogenetic diversity (PD) an accurate surrogate for functional diversity (FD)? How are FD PD correlations affected by the diversity index used, covarying factors and/or the strength of the phylogenetic signal in ecological traits? Location: Field study, coastal marsh plain Mekhada, Algeria, complemented by simulated data. Methods: FD and PD indicesmight correlate simply because variation in species richness and evenness (referred to as co-factors) influences both FD and PD values. We partition FD and PD indices into components influenced by species richness, evenness and species' (functional and phylogenetic) characteristics. When a simple partition was not found, comparison to nullmodels was used to remove the effects of co-factors. We examined correlations between ten FD and PD indices, among which several were shown to be connected using our mathematical partitioning approach and several were transformed by comparison with null models to control for effects of co-factors. In doing this, FD values were calculated using simulated trait values with varying phylogenetic signal. We then selected a subset of complementary FD and PD indices in exploring the influence of environmental variables on diversity across 75 plant assemblages in Mekhada. Results: Altogether, mathematical partitioning and the comparison to null models successfully removed the effects of co-factors when comparing FD and PD. For all indices affected by species richness, FD:PD correlations approached 1, irrespective of the trait evolution model used. In contrast, simulations showed that FD:PD correlations measured with indices unaffected by co-factors decreased when the phylogenetic signal in traits decreased. Applied to plant assemblages in Mekhada, complementary diversity indices showed that, despite significant (but moderate) FD PD correlation, FD but not PD was significantly correlated with themain stress gradient (salinity). Conclusions: From both our simulations and analysis of plant community diversity, PD was a poor surrogate for FD. In Mekhada, PD was also less correlated with environmental variables than FD. Species richness was found to be a better surrogate for FD than PD in identifying the ecological processes that distribute species along the salinity gradient.

Few studies have investigated the differences in the effects of these two specific infections on respiratory flora. The aim of this study was to explore whether infections with Bordetella pertussis and RSV have different effects on respiratory floral composition in neonates. MethodsNasopharyngeal respiratory flora was assessed by 16S ribosomal RNA amplification and V3-V4 region sequencing. Shannon and Simpson indices were calculated to determine the alpha diversity and principal coordinate analysis was performed to determine the beta diversity. ResultsIn total, 111 hospitalized neonates were divided into the pertussis (n = 29), RSV (n = 57), and control groups (n = 25) according to the pathogens detected. The relative abundance of Bordetella was significantly higher in the pertussis group (median: 19.18%, interquartile range: 72.57%). In contrast, this species was not detected in the other two groups. In the RSV group, the relative abundance of Streptococcus (median: 77.15%, interquartile range: 45.84%) was significantly higher than those in the pertussis and control groups (both P < 0.001). The alpha diversity of the RSV group was significantly lower than that of the control group (P < 0.001). Moreover, no statistically significant differences in the Shannon and Simpson indices were observed between the pertussis and control groups (P = 0.101 and P = 0.202, respectively). Principal coordinate analysis revealed a large overlap between the pertussis and control groups and a significant distance between the RSV and control groups without any overlap. DiscussionThus, the effects of infections with the two species, B. pertussis and RSV, impacted the diversity of nasopharyngeal flora differently. The principles underlying the difference in the effects of different pathogens on microbial flora require further investigation.					cheng, shu/IZE-4788-2023														2296-2360					JUN 7	2023	11								1034147	10.3389/fped.2023.1034147	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fped.2023.1034147								37351319					WOS:001010172500001

These collisions may result in huge economic losses and is also compromise passenger's safety. Identification of potential hazardous species, present at and in the vicinity of any airfield, is vital to improve bird hazard management at the airfields. Data of bird species present in the vicinity of BBI airport were collected by using point count method from eight different sites, representing different habitats, located around the airfield of the Benazir Bhutto International Airport, Islamabad. These sites represented commercial area around hotels, commercial habitat, naturally preserved recreational area, buildings with old pine trees, a water body, a sports ground, a landfill site, and a modern housing society. Data were analyzed for species density and relative abundance in each habitat, using the Simpson biodiversity index, Margalef diversity index, and clustering methods. Mean bird density in the area was found to be 0.0013 bird/m(2). Highest bird density was found to be of crow followed by kites and house martin as 0.0068, 0.00269 and 0.00206 birds/m(2) respectively. K-dominance species abundance model reflected the presence of kite as dominant species. Mean Simpson diversity index of 1.91 indicated the richness and evenness of species. Similarity index was found to be maximum to a value of 80.81 percent at commercial sites and lowest at modern housing society. Results of the study revealed that different habitats around the airport supported different species, thus, in order to formulate effective management plan for the airfields, species identification, richness, evenness and bird behavior should also be taken into consideration.

Fifteen species of spiders belonged to 6 families viz., Araneidae, Oxyopidae, Thomisidae, Salticidae, Tetragnathidae and Theridiidae. Family Araneidae contributed one third spider population (34.56%) followed by Oxyopidae (27%) and Thomisidae (24.53%). Frequent occurrence of Neoscona theisi followed by Oxyopes pankaji and Thomisus spectabilis was recorded. Maximum population of spiders was observed during second fortnight of October to first fortnight of November that coincides with boll development stage. Spider population varied in the cotton crop season in the cotton field, maximum population was observed in the month of October and November. The diversity and evenness indices were calculated for the collected spiders. The Shannon index value was 1.64, Simpson index value was 0.84, while Evenness index was 0.92. Positive correlation of spiders with prey density of cotton sucking pests was observed in case of whitefly and mirid while it was negatively correlated with aphid, leafhopper and thrips. Spider population was negatively correlated with all the weather parameters in transgenic cotton while positively correlated in non-transgenic cotton. No noticeable effect of either genotype variation (transgenic or non-transgenic) or limited pesticide intervention has been observed on spider population.

J	Hayek, LAC; Buzas, MA				Hayek, Lee-Ann C.; Buzas, Martin A.			ON THE PROPER AND EFFICIENT USE OF DIVERSITY MEASURES WITH INDIVIDUAL FIELD SAMPLES	JOURNAL OF FORAMINIFERAL RESEARCH												It is common to find that authors use more than one diversity measure in published research without providing interpretation or explanation. We use a survey of the last three years of articles published in this journal along with a classic data set of Parker from the Gulf of Mexico to show that the familiar practice of citing multiple indices, e.g., Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices and/or Fisher's alpha, each calculated for the same samples, is redundant and singularly uninformative. In addition, authors often register surprise at the performance of indices when describing diversity over gradients such as depth or time. We show that there is no requirement that the values of the indices be concordant over any gradient and the behavior of a measure can be mathematically determined by the distribution of the observed species. The measures we found to be the most common in current use were S, alpha, H, lambda, and max p(i). The mathematical equivalence of measures is shown through simple plots and description and a standard set of non-redundant measures on a log scale, lnS, H, and ln (1/ max p(i)) is recommended. Use of standardized analytical approaches to the study of problems of change in biodiversity removes limitations on the potential for inference concerning local as well as regional and global scales.																			0096-1191					JUL	2013	43	3					305	313		10.2113/gsjfr.43.3.305	http://dx.doi.org/10.2113/gsjfr.43.3.305													WOS:000322054100008

An understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and forest ecosystem functioning can be attained by evaluating variations in functional indices. The present study evaluated four taxonomic indicators: Species richness (SRic), Species evenness (SEve), Shannon index (H), and Simpson index (D), and three functional indices: Community Weighted Mean (CWM), Functional Diversity (FDiv), and Functional Regularity (FRO), in 17 temperate forest stands and their relationship with climatic factors in Western Himalaya. We evaluated the variation in the functioning of temperate forest stands and, the relationship between forest functioning and climatic parameters. We proposed an index for the evaluation of relative forest functionality by aggregating the three functional indices. The data were collected by randomly laying ten quadrats, each measuring 0.1 ha, in each of the seventeen forest stands. We found significant differences in the indices across the various forest stands. Structural equation modelling analysis found that maximum temperature, rainfall, SRic, D and FDiv were the main contributors to the temperate forest functionality. Therefore, the functionality of temperate forests in the region is being affected by changes in the rainfall and maximum temperature of the region.

The genetic diversity was high (percentage of polymorphic bands, PPB = 90.0%; Shannon's information index, I = 0.383 +/- 0.234) at the species level, but low within individual study populations (PPB = 35.8%; Shannon's information index I = 0.165 +/- 0.241). The mean coefficient of gene differentiation (G(st)) was 0.570, indicating that 43.0% of the genetic diversity resided within the population. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) indicated that 50.47% of the genetic diversity among the study populations was attributed to geographical location while 12.3% was attributed to differences in their habitats. An overall value of mean estimated number of gene flow (N-m = 0.377) indicated that there was limited gene flow among the sampled populations. The level of clonal diversity found within the populations was considerably high (Simpson's diversity index, D = 0.985) indicating that clonal diversity contributes to a major extent to the overall genetic variation in the genetic structure of N. nucifera. On the basis of the high G(st) and D values detected in this study we recommend that any future conservation plans for this species should be specifically designed to include those representative populations with the highest genetic variation for both in situ conservation and germplasm collection expeditions.

In this study, we compared the differences in gut microbial diversity and composition between 50 SZ subjects and 50 healthy matched subjects in Zhejiang, China via targeted next-generation sequencing (16S rRNA amplicon). Results Accordingly, the alpha diversity indices (observed species index, Shannon index, and Simpson index) of the gut microbiome in the healthy control group were higher than those in the SZ group. Additionally, principal coordinate analysis and non-metric multidimensional scaling of beta diversity revealed that patients with SZ clustered more tightly than healthy controls. At the phylum level, we found that the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria in the SZ group was significantly increased. At the genus level, the relative abundances of Prevotella, Parabacteroides, and Sutterella were significantly higher, whereas the abundances of Faecalibacterium, Blautia, Lachnospira, Clostridium, Ruminococcus, and Coprococcus were lower than those in the healthy control group. Further analyses revealed that Succinivibrio, Megasphaera, and Nesterenkonia may serve as potential biomarkers for distinguishing patients with SZ from those in the control cohort. Conclusions This study profiled differences in gut microbiome diversity, taxonomic composition, and function between SZ and healthy cohorts, and the insights from this research could be used to develop targeted next-generation sequencing-based diagnoses for SZ.

Still, studies using functional traits of microeukaryote ciliate communities in biological wastewater treatment plants are lacking. The present work explores the functional diversity of the ciliate protist community in a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) operating with a combined UASB-activated sludge system, and specifically to: 1) investigate the taxonomic and functional composition of the ciliate communities over time; 2) compare taxonomic and functional diversity indices with regard to its applicability in WWPS; 3) assess the relationship between the ciliate community's functional composition and the WWTPs temporal conditions; and 4) investigate the potential use of functional diversity as an indicator of WWTP efficiency. Totally, we recorded 21 ciliate species throughout 37 samplings. The number of species was low compared to other plants. Bacterivorous and flake-forming species were the main functional strategies found in the samples. The correlation between taxonomic and functional richness was significant, indicating a functionally redundant community. There was a correlation between the Simpson and Rao's quadratic entropy indexes suggesting that loss of taxonomic diversity leads to a loss of functional diversity. The homogeneity of the measured physical and chemical data led to functional homogenization and redundancy (homogenous CWM) of the ciliate community. The functional diversity is positively correlated with parameters of removal efficiency, indicating a promising application in WWTPs. Future studies will broaden knowledge on functional diversity in biological wastewater treatment systems, this being a first step with the unprecedented application of this methodology in artificial ecosystems.

This study aims to analyze the diversity, composition, and distribution pattern of tree species in Pachamalai Reserve Forest in the Eastern Ghats of Tamil Nadu State. Data were collected in the quadrant method, where 10 x 10 m(2) plots at different altitudes from 230 to 930 m with 50m regular intervals were plotted. A total of 73 tree species belonging to 35 families with the density of 1,372 individuals were enumerated from 3 ha. Overall, the most dominant tree species family was Fabaceae (21 species). The highest number in terms of density of tree species was observed for Pongamia pinnata and the most dominant on the basis of basal area was Tamarindus indica. The species inventory was calculated by Shannon-Weiner index (3.916), Simpson index (0.0206), and Margalef index (9.9667). With the increasing altitudinal gradient, the maximum species richness was observed in the middle elevation zone from 580 to 780 m. The results from the study could be helpful for monitoring and sustaining the forest resources, and important in preventing the loss of biodiversity and mitigating climate change.

J	Tatli, H; Dalfes, HN				Tatli, Hasan; Dalfes, H. Nuzhet			Analysis of temporal diversity of precipitation along with biodiversity of Holdridge life zones	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED CLIMATOLOGY												Many ecological studies show that diversity of vegetation is generally sensitive to hydrometeorological variables such as temperature, precipitation, and evaporation. Furthermore, it is also known that there have been changes in the precipitation regimes due to climate change and/or land use (such as urbanization). This study investigates the temporal diversity of the precipitation along with the Holdridge life zones (HLZ) using the biodiversity indices of true Hill numbers and Renyi entropy. The results show that there are no statistically significant changes in the "biodiversity" with respect to the HLZ. However, it was found that, although the biodiversity has remained more or less stable through 45 years, the HLZ classes have widened toward much warmer and drier vegetation cover. One can propose that the water regime of the rivers of the country has also changed due to the early melting of snow and an increase in evapotranspiration as a result of warming. Furthermore, using the Gini-Simpson diversity index for daily rainfall types recorded in a spatially homogeneous manner over Turkey, one can show that there are no significant changes in rainfall diversity in the coastal regions, but significant changes are observed in the internal and relatively high-altitude areas of the country.

These parasites can cause disease in these birds, whether farmed or free-living. The aim of this study was to describe the morphology of parasitic worms in the partridge, native to Poland, and the introduced pheasant, and to determine the level of infection of these birds with intestinal parasitic worms. The study showed that partridges are infected with several helminth species that had not previously been recorded in this species in Poland. Pheasants are more often infected by intestinal nematodes than are partridges. These worms can negatively affect the condition of partridges and increase their risk of infection with pathogenic protozoa. The results of parasitological examination should be used to develop programmes for diagnosis and monitoring of parasitic infections in order to keep flocks free of parasites. The aim of this study was to describe the morphology and means of identification of helminths in native partridges (65) and introduced pheasants (32) in Poland and to determine the level of intestinal infection of these birds by helminths using parasitological and ecological indices. The birds were acquired during the hunting season in the years 2015-2017. Nematodes, Capillaria phasianina, cestodes, Railietina friedbergeri, and one trematode, Brachylaima sp. were recorded for the first time in partridges in Poland. Our findings indicate that parasites are more prevalent in pheasants (prevalence 70.4%) than in partridges (prevalence 50.0%). The component community and infracommunity of parasites of partridges are more diverse (Simpson's diversity index: 0.63 and mean Brillouin diversity index: 0.10 +/- 0.17) and less dominated by a single parasite species (Capillaria sp., Berger-Parker dominance index: 0.53) than the pheasant parasite community (Simpson's diversity index: 0.07, mean Brillouin diversity index: 0.005 +/- 0.02, dominant species Heterakis gallinarum, Berger-Parker dominance index: 0.96). There were statistically significant differences between partridges and pheasants in the Brillouin diversity index and in the prevalence of Heterakis gallinarum (55.6% in pheasants vs. 19.0 in partridges). There were significant differences between wild and farmed partridges in the prevalence of infection by Capillaria sp. (4.3% vs. 37.5%) and H. gallinarum (39.1 vs. 6.2%). In conclusion, the pheasant was shown to be a reservoir, carrier, and shedder of nematodes, which may increase the risk of infection in partridges.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE 9TH INTERNATIONAL POLYCHAETE CONFERENCE	Zoosymposia				9th International Polychaete Conference	AUG 12-17, 2007	Portland, ME					We used data sets from two Arctic shelves to examine relationships between primary production (or a proxy), ice cover, and the diversity of polychaetes. Benthic samples were collected from the Northeast Water Polynya on the Northeast Greenland shelf and from the Barents Sea. Each of these areas is characterized by large differences in seasonal ice cover and primary production on a mesoscale. In addition to enumerating polychaete diversity, we also quantified the concentration of benthic algal pigments, sediment percent organic carbon, ice cover for the four years preceding sampling, and sediment grain size. In the Barents Sea, primary production was estimated from an ecosystem model. In both northeast Greenland and the Barents Sea, locations with lower primary production (Barents Sea) or proxies for primary production (benthic algal pigments: Greenland and Barents Sea), exhibited the greatest taxonomic richness. In Greenland, the area with the lowest concentration of benthic pigments had an ES(201) up to 30% higher than values from areas with four times more pigments. In the Barents Sea, ES(201) was greatest in the North under heaviest ice cover (>25% cover per year), again approximately 30% higher than in the South (<15% cover) or under the Polar Front (15-25% cover). Other factors also explained diversity: multiple regressions and Principal Component Analysis indicated that grain size, water depth and concentration of sediment organic carbon were important predictors of species diversity (Shannon-Wiener Index and Simpson's Reciprocal Index), but the results of these analyses were occasionally different from the patterns observed in the species accumulation curves or ES(201) values. Simpson's Index indicated that high ice-cover (and low primary production and benthic pigment) areas in the Barents Sea had greater evenness (lower dominance) than regions with higher indicators of food supply to the benthos. Low resource levels may prevent a few species from becoming very abundant and out-competing rare species. Diversity indices from northeast Greenland did not vary significantly among regions. We did not address habitat heterogeneity, but patchy distribution of food, combined with small-scale sediment heterogeneity also could enhance richness in food-poor areas. While the mechanism for the relationship between polychaete species richness and ice concentration or primary production is not clear, it does suggest that a change in polychaete diversity may need to be added to the list of possible responses of the benthos to climate-driven changes in ice cover.

The effects of edaphic factors on plant composition and species diversity were investigated in the middle and lower reaches of the Hanjiang River (MLHR), China. A total of 154 species of herbs were recorded, and vegetation was divided into 32 clusters according to a two-way indicator species analysis (TWINSPAN). Cynodon dactylon and Paspalum distichum were the most common clusters, accounting for 22.7% and 12.5% of total samples, respectively. Hydric and mesic species were dominant in the first and second transects, with mesophytes dominating the third and fourth transects. First transects situated were mainly composed of perennials and annuals, respectively. Perennials in second transects were present in 83% of sites, and perennials in the third and fourth transects were present in 86% of the sites. Margalef richness index (Dma), Simpson dominance diversity index (D), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H) and Pielou evenness index (Jsw) were higher in the first transects in some sites. The redundancy analysis (RDA) results indicated that soil moisture content was the dominant factor affecting hydrophilic vegetation types, and total nitrogen (TN) and soil organic matter (SOM) were the most critical factors affecting plant life history types and species diversities in this area.						, yingying/0000-0002-6081-0537														2223-7747				FEB	2022	11	4							531	10.3390/plants11040531	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/plants11040531								35214864					WOS:000765132000001
J	Talen, E				Talen, E			Land use zoning and human diversity: Exploring the connection	JOURNAL OF URBAN PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT												City planners are rallying against social and economic segregation by enacting regulatory changes, particularly zoning reform. Land use zoning. many argue, is one of the most potent tools planners have to enact change inhuman settlement patterns, and the goal of that change is often to foster greater levels of socioeconomic and land use diversity. This paper presents a method for connecting land use zoning and spatial patterns of diversity explicitly. It addresses the question of whether, and in what ways. zoning and human diversity are interrelated. Two fundamental questions arise in attempting to use zoning to foster greater diversity: What is the current relationship between human diversity and zoning, and second, how can zoning, given local experience, be changed to effectuate more diversity. To answer these questions, patterns of zoning by parcel and patterns of socioeconomic diversity were evaluated fur the twin cities of Champaign and Urbana, Ill. A form of the Simpson Diversity Index was used to measure socioeconomic and zoning diversity by census block group. The results showed an association between diverse residential zoning and income diversity. but other treasures of social diversity were not strongly correlated.																			0733-9488	1943-5444				DEC	2005	131	4					214	232		10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9488(2005)131:4(214)	http://dx.doi.org/10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9488(2005)131:4(214)													WOS:000233475800003

However, very little research has been carried out to study diversity of amaranth in Nepal. An experiment was conducted in the research field of the Institute of Agriculture and Animal Science (IAAS) at Sundarbazar, Lamjung, Nepal, during 2021 growing season to assess twelve amaranth accessions based on agromorphological characters. Seed materials were collected from the Nepal Agriculture Genetic Resource Center (NAGRC), Khumaltar, and the experiment was conducted in alpha-lattice design with 3 replications. Early maturing accessions had inflorescence at 42.33 days while late maturing accessions were after 82 days. ANOVA test for quantitative traits revealed significant differences among the accessions for all traits studied except stem girth. Similarly, from frequency distribution of agromorphological characters, high variability was found in stem pigmentation, terminal inflorescence shape, inflorescence color, and seed color. Diversity indices (Shannon-Weaver diversity index and Simpson's index of diversity) were also estimated in which inflorescence color, terminal inflorescence shape, seed color, stem pigmentation, leaf shape, branching index, and leaf pigmentation exhibited high variation confirming the presence of tremendous diversity in Amaranthus. Accessions NGRCO 6977, NGRCO 6969, and NGRCO 6871 had low disease incidence showing the potential of developing resistant varieties through precised breeding in the future. High yield attributing traits were possessed by accessions NGRCO 6977, CO 2435, NGRCO 6904, and CO 1239. Accession NGRCO 6977 was found superior among twelve accessions with highest grain yield and least disease occurrence which can further be evaluated in successive years as a promising variety in mid-hill region.

Genetic diversity in barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>) for traits associated with feed and forage purposes	INDIAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES												Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is an important coarse cereal cultivated in many parts of the world since ancient times and mostly used as cattle & poultry feed. However, in India due to climate change and frequent drought especially in drier areas barley offers a better alternative to extreme climate such as drought and winter. In the present study 220 cultivated barley accessions of indigenous and exotic origin were evaluated for different agro-morphological traits. The material was evaluated during the 2011-12 growing season at DWR, Karnal where observations were recorded on 13 agro-morphological traits. The results showed high variability among the accessions for grain per spike, green fodder yield, grain yield, grain yield of regenerated crop, biological yield and harvest index (HI). Based on K-mean clustering pattern, the genotypes were grouped into five clusters having significant inter-cluster distances. Shannon-Weaver's diversity index (H) and Simpson's index (1/D) was used to assess the phenotypic diversity of traits for each cluster genotypes and overall. Shannon's diversity index revealed large diversity for most traits. The average H for the whole population was 0.91 with the lowest 0.74 for HI, the highest (1.01) for days to heading. The simple correlation coefficients among traits were estimated, which showed significant positive relations between grain yield with plant height (r=0.25**), green fodder yield (r=0.15*), grain yield of regenerated crop (r=0.13*) and HI (0.19**), while negative correlation with days to heading (r=-0.35**). Sources for individual traits in different genotypes of barley clusters were identified which can be used as donors in hybridization programme for dual purpose barley improvement programme.

J	Forge, TA; Simard, SW				Forge, TA; Simard, SW			Structure of nematode communities in forest soils of southern British Columbia: relationships to nitrogen mineralization and effects of clearcut harvesting and fertilization	BIOLOGY AND FERTILITY OF SOILS												The effects of clearcut harvesting and fertilization of clearcuts on the structure of nematode communities were assessed at three sites in the southern interior of British Columbia. The Shannon-Weaver and Simpson indices of diversity were greater in clearcuts than in forests. The diversity of the bacterivorous and fungivorous trophic groups were not significantly different between clearcuts and forests, whereas the diversity of omnivorous and predacious nematodes was lower in clearcuts than in forests. The nematode maturity index (MI) was lower in clearcuts than in forests. Several ratios describing the prevalence of enrichment opportunists (the absolute abundance of Rhabditida, the relative abundance of Rhabditida, and the ratio of Aphelenchida/fungivorous nematodes) were greater in clearcuts than in forests. Nematode diversity tended to be lower in fertilizer treatments than in controls within clearcuts, but the effects were not consistent across sample dates. The MI was lower in fertilizer treatments than in controls. All ratios representing the relative abundance of enrichment opportunists were greater in fertilizer treatments than in controls. The MI was negatively correlated with N mineralization in data sets representing forests and fertilized and non-fertilized plots within clearcuts. None of the diversity indices were correlated with N mineralization. The absolute abundance of Rhabditida and the relative abundance of Rhabditida were both consistently positively correlated with N mineralization in the data set representing fertilized and non-fertilized plots within clearcuts, and the absolute abundance of Rhabditida was positively correlated with N mineralization in forests.																			0178-2762	1432-0789				SEP	2001	34	3					170	178																WOS:000171266400007

Comparison of taxonomic, colony morphotype and PCR-RELP methods to characterize microfungal diversity	MYCOLOGIA												We compared three methods for estimating fungal species diversity in soil samples. A rapid screening method based on gross colony morphological features and color reference standards was compared with traditional fungal taxonomic methods and PCR-RFLP for estimation of ecological indices of soil microfungal community composition. Normalized counts of colony morphotypes on dichloran rose bengal medium were used to estimate species richness (S) and evenness (J) and to calculate Shannon's diversity (H) and Simpson's (SI) dominance indices. Isolates were obtained by dilution plating techniques from litter and soil layer samples taken from Douglas-fir forest and clear-cut areas at two locations in the Cascade Mountains. The highest correspondence (97%) was observed between taxonomic identification and RFLP patterns (32:33). Cladistic analyses of PCR-RFLP patterns indicated an 81% correspondence between RFLP patterns:colony morphotypes (33:41). A correspondence of 78% was observed between traditional taxonomic identification:colony morphotypes (32:41). Statistical analyses of ecological indices based on quantitative'application of the colony morphotyping method indicated significant differences (P < 0.05) in fungal community composition between forested and clear-cut areas at the Toad Road site but not at the Falls Creek site. Comparisons of ecological indices based on traditional identification of taxa by microscopic characterization on defined culture media resulted in identical findings of statistical significance. The colony morphotyping approach is proposed as a screening method to identify potential effects of land management practices, edaphic factors and pollutants on microfungal diversity.

J	Semy, K; Singh, MR				Semy, Khikeya; Singh, Maibam Romeo			Changes in plant diversity and community attributes of coal mine affected forest in relation to a community reserve forest of Nagaland, Northeast India	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												This study assessed changes in herb, shrub and tree composition of Coal mining-affected forest (CMAF) area in relation to a community reserve forest designated as Non-affected forest (NAF) of Changki village, Nagaland, Northeast India. In all the three plant life forms, Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson's diversity index and Margalef richness index showed higher species diversity and richness in NAF compared to CMAF while Sorenson's index reveals a low species similarity between the sites. Pielou's evenness was higher at NAF and a contiguous pattern was prominently distributed in both the forest. The family Poaceae, Asteraceae and Cyperaceae dominated the CMAF while Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae and Poaceae dominated NAF. The NAF has greater plant density compared to CMAF and the IVI shows the dominant status of native tree Terminalia myriocarpa in the Northeastern tropical forest. Weeds like Ageratum conyzoides, Bidens pilosa and Drymaria cordata were prominently distributed in CMAF while Abarema clypearia, Inula cappa and Strobilanthes coloratus has been obstructed by mining. The result imparted that the plant diversity of Nagaland tropical forests are under threat due to coal mining which has reduced the vegetation diversity and induce the loss of dominant plant species. As such, regulation of mine waste, land reclamation projects, robust forest management and bioremediation can be scientifically integrated to reduce the mining repercussion effects. Moreover, the result emphasizes the need to impart the tribal knowledge of preserving natural forest to the upcoming generations and develop conservation strategies to prevent further degradation or loss of biodiversity in this part of the Indo-Burma hotspot region.																			0564-3295	2661-8982				2023 MAY 26	2023										10.1007/s42965-023-00310-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42965-023-00310-z		MAY 2023											WOS:000995134200001

Helminth parasite assemblages in two cyprinids with different life history strategies	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Parasitic organisms can affect ecosystems by driving population dynamics of the hosts and influencing community interactions. The life history of the host can determine the relationship with its parasites. Reproductive effort and age of the host are two life history aspects often used to explain parasitic infection. In this study, we examined helminth parasite assemblages in two cyprinids with contrasting reproductive strategies, Cyprinella venusta (crevice spawners) and Notropis volucellus (broadcast spawners), in the Paluxy River (Texas) from May 2014 through October 2015. Host reproduction was measured using the gonadosomatic index, and standard length was used as an estimate of age. Parasite infection was measured using total number of helminths, parasite richness, Shannon's diversity, and Simpson's diversity. Our results revealed significant differences in parasite number and diversity between the two species, but not between males and females within species. Additionally, our results showed that standard length was a better predictor of parasitic infection than the gonadosomatic index. The relationship between host size and parasitic infection was expected; however, the lack of a relationship between gonadosomatic indices and parasitic infection was surprising. In conclusion, standard length was a better predictor of parasitic infection than the gonadosomatic index, and as such multiple species and life history traits should be considered when investigating host-parasite relationships.

In this study, we used the Biolog method and ELISA to evaluate the possible effects of OsrHSA transgenic rice on soil microbial utilization of carbon substrates under field conditions. There were no significant differences in average well-color development (AWCD) values, Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), Simpson dominance indices (D) and Shannon-Wiener evenness indices (E) of microbial communities in rhizosphere soils at eight samplings between OsrHSA transgenic rice and its non-transgenic counterpart. The main carbon sources utilized by soil microbes were carbohydrates, carboxylic acids, amino acids and polymers. The types, capacities and patterns of carbon source utilization by microbial communities in rhizosphere soils were similar throughout the detection period. We detected no OsrHSA protein in the roots of OsrHSA transgenic rice. We concluded that OsrHSA transgenic rice and the rHSA protein it produced did not alter the functional diversity of microbial communities in the rhizosphere.

The dynamical equations for the abundances and higher order moments of the abundances are established. Due to the neutrality assumption these equations are autonomous, enabling an exact analysis of spatio-temporal dynamics. We compute local (i.e., inside a patch) and global (i.e., between patches) diversities, and illustrate our results with two examples: (1) a non-spatial community, for which we recover previous results, and (2) a model with a finite number of patches which are all connected to each other with equal migration intensity.

J	Tamartash, R; Ehsani, SM				Tamartash, Reza; Ehsani, Seyedeh Mohadeseh			The effect of earthworms on plant diversity and soil properties under different landuses	ACTA ECOLOGICA SINICA												Earthworms have significant effect on vegetation and soil physical and chemical properties. The relationship between earthworms and biodiversity is important in ecological researches. Therefore, the effects of earthworm on plant diversity and various indices of diversity and richness, as well as physical and chemical properties of soil in shrub, grass and bare vegetation types on exclosure and grazing sites of Miankaleh Mazandaran biosphere reserve is investigated in this work. Accordingly, sampling was carried out randomly-systematically in three different vegetative types (shrubs, grass and bare soil) at 0 to 20 cm depth. Each vegetative types was placed on three transects of 100 m, 10 plots at a distance of 30 m. Earthworm and soil were sampled from the center of each plot of 25 cm x 25 cm. The Simpson and ShannonWiener indexes and Margalef and Menhinick richness indices were used to evaluate diversity and richness of species at different grazing intensities. Stepwise regression was used to study the relationship between diversity and richness indices with different earthworm parameters. The results showed that there was significant difference of potassium and nitrogen in vegetation types of both exclosure and grazing sites at P <= .01. Furthermore, the organic carbon, organic matter and potassium in the exclosure site and nitrogen and soil moisture in the grazing site are increased by earthworm abundance.

State-level changes in US racial and ethnic diversity, 1980 to 2015: A universal trend?	DEMOGRAPHIC RESEARCH												BACKGROUND Few studies have examined long-term changes in ethnoracial diversity for US states despite the potential social, economic, and political ramifications of such changes at the state level. OBJECTIVE We describe shifts in diversity magnitude and structure from 1980 through 2015 to determine if states are following a universal upward path. METHODS Decennial census data for 1980. 2010 and American Community Survey data for 2015 are used to compute entropy index (E) and Simpson index (S) measures of diversity magnitude based on five panethnic populations. A typology characterizes the racial/ethnic structure of states. RESULTS While initial diversity level and subsequent pace of change vary widely, every state has increased in diversity magnitude since 1980. A dramatic decline in the number of predominantly white states has been accompanied by the rise of states with multigroup structures that include Hispanics. These diverse states are concentrated along the coasts and across the southern tier of the country. Differences in panethnic population growth (especially rapid Hispanic and Asian growth coupled with white stability) drive the diversification trend. CONCLUSIONS The diversity hierarchy among states has remained relatively stable over the past 35 years in the face of universal gains in diversity magnitude and the increasing heterogeneity of racial/ethnic structures. CONTRIBUTION We document ethnoracial diversity patterns at an understudied geographic scale, the state level, where diversity may have important consequences across a range of institutional domains.

The sampling method and the number of plots are factors affecting the estimation of plant biodiversity. In the present study, effects of different inventory grids on estimation of tree species diversity were compared in semi-arid forests of Iran. There were selected 50 hectares of these forests representing the regional forests. Sampling procedures were carried out on circular plots (1,000m(2)) within inventory grids, with dimensions of 50 x 50 m (200 plots), 100 x 50 m (100 plots), 100 x 100 m (50 plots), 200 x 50 m (50 plots), 200 x 100 m (25 plots), and 250 x 200 m (10 plots). For each plot, the type of the species and the number of trees were recorded. Simpson (1-D), Hill (N-2), Shannon-Wiener (H'), Mc Arthur (N-1), Smith-Wilson (E-var) and Margalef (R-1) indices were used to estimate the tree species diversity. The inventory grid was evaluated based on the precision and cost criteria (E%(2) x T). The obtained sampling error values showed that the inventory grid consisting of 200 plots exhibited more accuracy for estimating the biodiversity indices. But based on the results of E%(2) x T, the inventory grid with 25 plots was selected as the most appropriate one for estimating the tree species diversity in semi-arid forests. The results of this study can also serve to estimate the tree species diversity in other semi-arid forests of Iran.																			1336-5266	1338-7014				MAY	2019	46	1					24	29		10.2478/foecol-2019-0004	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/foecol-2019-0004													WOS:000663795000004

However, the small mesh sizes of beach seine nets and fishing activities that involve dragging a net through the nearshore seabed tend to destroy fish breeding grounds and capture juvenile fish and non-target benthic macroinvertebrates, which get discarded. This study investigated the impact that before and after closed season for beach seine fishing had on macroinvertebrates species diversity indices at two Ghanaian beaches with different fishing pressures. The study was carried out at OLA and Sisimbo Beaches located in the Central Region of Ghana, taking advantage of the statutory 1-month national fishing closed season in July 2022. Six (6) replicate sediment samples were taken at each beach after landing by beach seine fishers every month for 6 months, from April to June, and August to October, representing before and after closed season, respectively. Benthic macroinvertebrates were retrieved from the samples using appropriate protocols and subjected to indirect (Shannon, Simpson, Renyi) and direct (species abundance models, species accumulation models, multivariate statistics) measures of species diversity analyses. The indirect species diversity indices increased monotonically the following 2 months after closed season but reduced in the third month after closed season at both beaches. Conversely, the direct measures of diversity indices revealed that closed season for beach seine fishing improved species numbers and richness at both study beaches. This is the first report on the impact of a closed season on macroinvertebrates in any African country.

The objective of this study was to investigate the applicability of the Biolog EcoPlate (TM) technique and evaluate comparatively the applied endpoints, for the characterisation of the effects of metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) on freshwater microbial communities. Microcosm experiments were run to assess the effect of nano ZnO and nano TiO2 in freshwater at 0.8-100 mg/L concentration range. The average well colour development, substrate average well colour development, substrate richness, Shannon index and evenness, Simpson index, McIntosh index and Gini coefficient were determined to quantify the metabolic capabilities and functional diversity. Comprehensive analysis of the experimental data demonstrated that short-term exposure to TiO2 and ZnO NPs affected the metabolic activity at different extent and through different mechanisms of action. TiO2 NPs displayed lower impact on the metabolic profile showing up to 30% inhibition. However, the inhibitory effect of ZnO NPs reached 99% with clearly concentration-dependent responses. This study demonstrated that the McIntosh and Gini coefficients were well applicable and sensitive diversity indices. The parallel use of general metabolic capabilities and functional diversity indices may improve the output information of the ecological studies on microbial communities.

Diversity was analysed using Shannon, Margalef, Simpson, and Dominance indices. Bycatch representativity was calculated as the difference percentage between the target catch and non-target, in weight. The bycatch comprised 51 taxa and was composed primarily of fish. In addition, 12 species of pelagic habits (i.e. fishes and sharks) were also captured during the deployment/retrieval of fishing gear. The most frequent species (by number of individuals) were chimaeras (Hydrolagus melanophasma), grenadiers (Antimora rostrata, Coryphaenoides delsolari, and Coryphaenoides armatus), and sharks (Etmopterus granulosus and Centroscymnus owstonii). The diversity was medium low, according to the Shannon indices (0.5-1.8), with a negative trend for dominance and a positive trend for equitability.

The usefulness of the methods for molecular differentiation of these isolates was evaluated using computer program analysis of the obtained DNA profiles with manually made corrections as well as with the Simpson's index of diversity. The results indicated that PFGE with the XbaI restriction endonuclease, possessing the index of diversity D = 1.00, was the most powerful tool to reveal genetic relationship among E. coli O157 strains isolated from different sources.

In 2010, a national PulseNet database was established to curate C. botulinum pulsotypes and facilitate epidemiological investigations, particularly for serotypes A and B strains frequently associated with botulism cases in the United States. Between 2010 and 2014 we performed pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using a PulseNet protocol, uploaded the resulting PFGE patterns into a national database, and analyzed data according to PulseNet criteria (UPGMA clustering, Dice coefficient, 1.5% position tolerance, and 1.5% optimization). A retrospective data analysis was undertaken on 349 entries comprised of type A and B strains isolated from foodborne and infant cases to determine epidemiological relevance, resolution of the method, and the diversity of the database. Most studies to date on the pulsotype diversity of C. botulinum have encompassed very small sets of isolates; this study, with over 300 isolates, is more comprehensive than any published to date. Epidemiologically linked isolates had indistinguishable patterns, except in four instances and there were no obvious geographic trends noted. Simpson's Index of Diversity (D) has historically been used to demonstrate species diversity and abundance within a group, and is considered a standard descriptor for PFGE databases. Simpson's Index was calculated for each restriction endonuclease (SmaI, XhoI), the pattern combination SmaI-XhoI, as well as for each toxin serotype. The D values indicate that both enzymes provided better resolution for serotype B isolates than serotype A. XhoI as the secondary enzyme provided little additional discrimination for C. botulinum. SmaI patterns can be used to exclude unrelated isolates during a foodborne outbreak, but pulsotypes should always be considered concurrently with available epidemiological data.

J	Ingty, T				Ingty, Tenzing			Pastoralism in the highest peaks: Role of the traditional grazing systems in maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem function in the alpine Himalaya	PLOS ONE												Rangelands cover around half of the planet's land mass and provide vital ecosystem services to over a quarter of humanity. The Himalayan rangelands, part of a global biodiversity hotspot is among the most threatened regions in the world. In rangelands of many developing nations policies banning grazing in protected areas is common practice. In 1998, the Indian state of Sikkim, in the Eastern Himalaya, enacted a grazing ban in response to growing anthropogenic pressure in pastures and forests that was presumably leading to degradation of biodiversity. Studies from the region demonstrate the grazing ban has had some beneficial results in the form of increased carbon stocks and regeneration of some species of conservation value but the ban also resulted in negative outcomes such as reduced household incomes, increase in monocultures in lowlands, decreased manure production in a state that exclusively practices organic farming, spread of gregarious species, and a perceived increase in human wildlife conflict. This paper explores the impact of the traditional pastoral system on high elevation plant species in Lachen valley, one of the few regions of Sikkim where the grazing ban was not implemented. Experimental plots were laid in along an elevation gradient in grazed and ungrazed areas. Ungrazed areas are part of pastures that have been fenced off (preventing grazing) for over a decade and used by the locals for hay formation. I quantified plant species diversity (Species richness, Shannon index, Simpson diversity index, and Pielou evenness index) and ecosystem function (above ground net primary productivity ANPP). The difference method using movable exlosure cages was used in grazing areas to account for plant ANPP eaten and regrowth between grazing periods). The results demonstrate that grazing significantly contributes to greater plant species diversity (Species richness, Shannon index, Simpson diversity index, and Pielou evenness index) and ecosystem function (using above ground net primary productivity as an indicator). The multidimensional scaling and ANOSIM (Analysis of Similarities) pointed to significant differences in plant species assemblages in grazed and ungrazed areas. Further, ecosystem function is controlled by grazing, rainfall and elevation. Thus, the traditional transhumant pastoral system may enhance biodiversity and ecosystem function. I argue that a complete restriction of open grazing meet neither conservation nor socioeconomic goals. Evidence based policies are required to conserve the rich and vulnerable biodiversity of the region.					ingty, tenzing/GRY-2854-2022	ingty, tenzing/0000-0001-7993-4241													1932-6203					JAN 7	2021	16	1							e0245221	10.1371/journal.pone.0245221	http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245221								33411837					WOS:000608044300116

BACTERIAL COMMUNITY STRUCTURE AND DIVERSITY IN THE SOIL OF THREE DIFFERENT LAND USE TYPES IN A COASTAL WETLAND	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												The effect of land use on soil bacterial community structure and diversity was studied in three typical land use types in the Yancheng National Nature Reserve, China. These represented long-term arable land use, pristine wetland, and long-term forest land. Physico-chemical parameters of the soils were determined, and high-throughput sequencing of V3 fragments of the bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons was applied to study the community structure of soil bacteria and explore relationships with soil properties. The results showed that in all three soil types the dominant bacterial phyla were Acidobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria, whose abundance differed with land use patterns. Combined with Chao index and ACE index, we found that the bacterial richness of arable land was significantly higher than that of forest or wetland soil. The Simpson and Shannon indices were similar in the three soils, indicating that there was no significant difference in bacterial community diversity. Acidobacteria were most abundant in wetland soil, forest soil was rich in Actinobacteria, and arable soil contained Proteobacteria and Firmicute at high abundance. Correlation analysis identified that soil acidity and moisture content were important driving factors affecting the microbial community composition and structure.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2020	18	6					8131	8144		10.15666/aeer/1806_81318144	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1806_81318144													WOS:000604344600043

Species Diversity and Qualitative Assessment of Ground Beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in Three Riparian Habitats	ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY												In a 3-yr study involving saltcedar-free, saltcedar-infested, and burned habitats in a riparian area at Lake Meredith, TX, the number of carabid species collected, diversity indices, and indicator species varied significantly among habitats. A 3-yr average of 15, 14, and 24 carabid species were collected from the saltcedar-free, saltcedar-infested, and burned habitats, respectively. Values for species richness, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices, and evenness index for pooled data collected from 2005 to 2007 were higher in the burned habitat followed by the saltcedar-free habitat and the saltcedar-infested habitat. Within-year parameters across the three habitats generally followed the pooled data results with some variation. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analyses clearly indicated groups of carabid species preferred specific habitats. Five species in the burned area had indicator species percentage values >50% (Agonum punctiforme, Agonum texanum, Brachinus alternans, Harpalus pensylvanicus, and Poecilus chalcites). In the saltcedar-infested and saltcedar-free habitats, only one species in each habitat had indicator species percentage values that exceeded 50%: Calathus opaculus and Cicindela punctulata punctulata, respectively.

Microalgae biodiversity and biomass status in Qua Iboe Estuary mangrove swamp, Nigeria	AQUATIC ECOLOGY												Microalgae composition, abundance, diversity and biomass of the Qua Iboe Estuary mangrove swamp were studied. The results revealed the rich assemblage of the brackish ecosystem. Six major taxanomic classes were encountered. These were the Bacillariophyceae, Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Chrysophyceae, Euglenophyceae and Phaeophyceae. Their composition, abundance and diversity exhibits strong seasonal variation. Variations between pelagic and sedimentary habitats were also noticed. The diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) dominated the habitats. Actinoptychus undalatus, Navicula radiosa and Amphora ovalis co-dominated the pelagic water column; while the epipellic (intertidal) and benthic (subtidal) sediments were co-dominated by A. ovalis and Actinoptychus undulatus. Analyses of the Shannon's index of general diversity (H-1), McArthur-Terborgh species equitability index (E) and Simpson's index of dominance (D) of the microalgae communities revealed that A. ovalis with a mean H-1-value of 0.25, E-value of 0.08 and D-value of 0.05 was the most prevalent genus in the mangrove ecosystem despite its uneven distribution. The densities of the microalgae communities corresponded with their biomass statuses and were seriously impacted by oil spillage. This forms the basis of concern because the estuary is associated with a high probability of major oil pollution with serious consequences for ecological stability and fisheries.

Contribution to the knowledge of the macroinvertebrate fauna of the streams of Kahuzi-Biega National Park, Democratic Republic of Congo	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												The Albertine Rift is one of Africa's major biodiversity hotspots. However, the aquatic fauna of its western border in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) remains understudied and poorly characterised. Kahuzi-Biega National Park (KBNP) in DRC is a crucial link for biodiversity conservation of this hotspot; however, scientific studies of this rich biodiversity are scarce because of insecurity and harsh field conditions. In the current study, benthic macroinvertebrates communities and some environmental conditions were investigated in 10 rivers in the KBNP. Eighty-four morphospecies, belonging to 47 families and 12 orders, were sampled from 13 sites. The abundance and diversity of taxa within systematic groups varied across the study area. Spatial distribution of systematic groups was also analysed. The high morphospecies richness, characterised by the number of families and Shannon's and Simpson's Diversity Indices, recorded at some sites was probably owing to the diversity of substratum and undisturbed environmental conditions observed in these forested rivers. Conversely, some sites presented lower species richness, possibly because of unfavourable natural conditions.

J	Morelli, E; Verdi, A				Morelli, Enrique; Verdi, Ana			Aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity in freshwater streams with native riparian vegetation of Uruguay	REVISTA MEXICANA DE BIODIVERSIDAD												Uruguay has a dense hydrographic network, nevertheless the knowledge of the aquatic macroinvertebrate community is still lacking. In recent decades afforestation with exotic species has increased which has produced changes in riparian vegetation of some rivers. The aim of this research was to determine the composition and trophic structure of macroinvertebrate community and its relationship to some physicochemical parameters in eight streams where the native forest is still well preserved and provide the basis for future studies. Samples were collected from December 2006 to December 2007. Temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH and conductivity were measured in situ. Taxonomic composition and abundance were determined, a principal component analysis and a canonical correspondence analysis were carried out with the physico-chemical and biological parameters. The alpha diversity was calculated using the Shannon-Weaver (H'), dominance of Simpson (D) and Pielou evenness indexes (J'). Beta diversity was determined employing similarity index of Bray-Curtis. A total of 1 291 specimens belonging 92 taxa were recorded. The most abundant taxa were Ephemeroptera (36%), Amphipoda (17%) and Coleoptera (12%). The streams show high diversity and low dominance. Conductivity, pH, and temperature were the main factors in determining the macroinvertebrate distribution and composition.																			1870-3453	2007-8706				DEC	2014	85	4					1160	1170		10.7550/rmb.45419	http://dx.doi.org/10.7550/rmb.45419													WOS:000349454300005
J	Skácelová, O; Leps, J				Skacelova, Olga; Leps, Jan			The relationship of diversity and biomass in phytoplankton communities weakens when accounting for species proportions	HYDROBIOLOGIA												The relationship between productivity (or biomass) and species diversity in ecological communities remains a hotly debated topic. While much is already known about vascular plants, little is known in other types of organisms. We used a broad and standardized database of phytoplankton samples from the Czech Republic, containing 413 samples of various types of stagnant waters to evaluate this relationship. Biomass was characterized by the total biovolume/ml, the total number of individuals/ml and cells/ml all giving similar results. All these indicators spanned over five orders of magnitude while the number of species ranged between 1 and 57. Diversity was characterized by indices of Hill's unified notation series progressively accounting for species proportion effects. The number of species showed an asymmetric unimodal relationship with biomass. The relationship weakened when considering diversity indices including species proportions. At very low productivity values (characterized by low biomass), diversity was probably restricted by the ability of algae and cyanobacteria to survive a lack of nutrients, in high productivities, by the competition for light. Medium productivities, where maximum diversity was found, exhibited large variability of diversity values (including very low ones), suggesting that low diversity of phytoplankton samples can be caused by multitude of factors.

The fishes collected in this study were netted from two collection points using bag nets. We also measured some environmental parameters during the time of netting. From the collection, we determined the Simpson's index of diversity (1-D), the Shannon-Wiener index (H), evenness (E) and the Sorenson's coefficient of community (CC) to find out the species richness, abundance, evenness and the levels of similarity of the two collection points. We also converted the H values to their true diversities (effective number of species [ENS]) for an adequate comparison. The indices and coefficient (H = 3.72-3.94, E = 0.830-0.832, 1-D = 0.973-0.979 and CC = 0.87) indicate that the overall integrity of biodiversity of the two collecting points is high. From the true diversity values, we ascertained that the first point, having 62 species of fishes, is 1.24 times as diverse as the second one, having 50 species. We have attributed the fish diversity to a compound of abiotic and biotic factors, which we explain in the discussion part. We also documented 20 fish species, new records for the Indian Sundarbans; some are new records from West Bengal. Furthermore, we discuss the possible reasons for their occurrence. Our study brings the number of fish species recorded from the Indian Sundarbans to 378.

Monitoring of species diversity of riparian forests was conducted every year from 2016 to 2019 in the Xiamale forest district in the lower reaches of the Yarkant River, and in the Shaya forest district and the lunnan forest district in the upper and middle reaches of the Tarim River. The Pielou index, Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson index, and importance value were used to analyze the influence of flooding. The results showed the following: (1) After three years of flooding, indices for the lower reaches of the Yarkant River and Tarim River were significantly increased and 11 new plant species appeared. (2) With increasing distance from the river channel, plant density and species diversity decreased. Flooding trends are the main factors affecting the distribution of plant species and water is the main restricting factor that influences plant growth in arid areas; thus, desert riparian forests improved significantly after flooding. (3) Flooding increases the regeneration capacity and species diversity of plant communities in desert riparian forests. In order to maintain the current trend of ecological improvement, flooding irrigation must continue.					钱, 凯旋/HNP-0736-2023															2071-1050				JAN	2023	15	2							1243	10.3390/su15021243	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su15021243													WOS:000915993500001

A total of 145 phylotypes (with a cluster distance of 0.03) belonging to 18 phyla were identified in the communities. The share of OTUs that were not identified at the phylum level varied in the range of 0.6-3.0%. According to the ACE and CHAO1 diversity indices, bacterioplankton species richness was highest in the hypertrophic section of the Chono Harayh channel below the dam of the Durgun Hydropower Station and lowest in the mesotrophic section of the Zavkhan River above the Taishir Reservoir. According to the Shannon and Simpson indices, the species abundance of different species in the community characterized the mesotrophic and eutrophic pelagic zones of the Taishir and Durgun reservoirs, respectively, as areas with the most equality. The reservoir systems differed significantly in taxonomic diversity, as evidenced by the ratio of common and unique OTUs, but their representation was not uniform along the rivers.

The collection of macroinvertebrates was carried out using the Surber sampler, in two periods (dry and rainy). In the first season, an average of 710 ind/m2 were collected, classified in 23 taxa of the orders diptera, ephemeroptera and tricoptera, and in the second season 16790 ind/m2 were collected, with 6 taxa of the orders haplotaxide and diptera, the species indicating organic pollution, Chironomus sp, Tubbier sp and Psychoda sp, present mostly in season 2. The highest average indices in season 1 compared to season 2 were IBMWP with 60 points indicating moderately polluted doubtful water quality and 11 points indicating highly polluted critical quality, the diversity of Shannon - Wiener 1,33 and 0,30 indicating waters with limited diversity, the equity of Pielou 0,50 show more stable and 0,20 less stable populations; the lowest indices in station 1 compared to season 2 were, Simpson dominance 0,37 indicator of low dominance and higher diversity and 0,9 indicator of higher dominance, lower diversity and higher organic pollution.																			0379-3982	2215-3241				JUL-SEP	2022	35	3					117	127		10.18845/tm.v35i3.5662	http://dx.doi.org/10.18845/tm.v35i3.5662													WOS:000879071600009

Evaluating the impact of synthetic herbicides on soil dwelling macrobes an the physical state of soil in an agro-ecosystem	ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY												This study evaluated three herbicides active ingredients: Paraquat, Glyphosate and 2,4-D Amine in commercial formulations as Frankoquat, Roundup and Agriherb respectively under field conditions to determine their influence on soil dwelling macrobes and the physical state of soil. Herbicides were serially diluted to three treatment concentrations for each plus three controls. Herbicide concentrations were applied to the demarcated field on three consecutive occasions in splits. Macrobes extraction from soil was done under a stereo microscope at 20 x magnification. The Simpson's diversity index was used to calculate the soil macrobes diversity. Soil water content, bulk density and total porosity of sampled soils were determined. The study revealed that both herbicides and non-herbicides treatment had no statistical significance (p > 0.05) on the soil dwelling mac robes. Also, a Simpson's index of diversity, estimated as 53.46%, showed how the experimental area is lowly diverse in the specific soil dwelling macrobes identified. Significant correlations existed between the soil water content, bulk density, total porosity and number of soil macrobes at p < 0.05. This level of significance showed in most instances for Frankoquat herbicide concentration treatments as well as Roundup. For Agriherb and control treatments the correlations were present but majority was not significant. In most situations, the soil dwelling macrobes decreased with increasing soil physical conditions. Thus, the dynamics in soil physical properties affected macrobes abundance in soil, with the slightest influence coining from the herbicides concentrations used in the experiment. The study recommended that Frankoquat and Roundup herbicides could be used to control weeds on farmer's field because, their influence were slightly felt on the soil macrobes and also, quite a number soil dwelling macrobes recovered after application.

Food web structure of nematode communities in irrigated rice fields	HELIYON												Nematodes are a key component of the soil food web and they play an important role in the provision of ecosystem services. Rice cultivation in Mwea, Kenya involves the intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides which may affect the complexity of the nematode-based soil food web. This study examined the nematode diversity and food web structure in irrigated rice fields in Nyangati and Tebere in Mwea, Kirinyaga County, Kenya. Nematodes were identified up to the genus level and soil physico-chemical properties were also determined. Aphelenchoides and Longidorus occurred in significantly greater proportions in Tebere, while in Nyangati there was a high abundance of Helicotylenchus. Aphelenchoides was positively correlated to soil electrical conductivity. From additive diversity partitioning of genus richness, the alpha and 8 components contributed 33.7% and 66.3% of the gamma diversity, respectively. For Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, the largest contribution to overall diversity was from alpha component. Soil food web indices were similar across the two regions. Channel and basal indices were below 30% while Enrichment (EI) and Structure (SI) indices were above 50%. There was no variation in metabolic footprints except for the fungivore footprint which was significantly higher in Tebere. Based on the EI and SI, the soil food web in paddy rice fields in Mwea was structured and enriched with moderate disturbance. Due to the high prevalence of economically damaging parasitic nematodes in the rice fields, appropriate management schemes that enhance specific components of the soil food web and increase the suppressive ability of soil against plant-parasitic nematodes should be implemented.

Persistence of repeated triadimefon application and its impact on soil microbial functional diversity	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES												The effects of repeated applications of the fungicide triadimefon in agricultural soil on the microbial functional diversity of the soil and on the persistence of the fungicide in the soil were investigated under laboratory conditions. The degradation half-lives of triadimefon at the recommended dosage, simulated by a first-order kinetic model, were 23.90, 22.95, and 21.52 days for the first, second, and third applications, respectively. Throughout this study, no significant inhibition of the Shannon-Wiener index (H') was observed. However, the Simpson index (1/D) and the McIntosh index (U) were obviously reduced (p <= 0.05) during the initial 3 days after the first triadimefon application and thereafter, gradually recovered to or exceeded the level of the control soil. A similar trend in variation but with a faster recovery in the 1/D and U was observed after the second and third triadimefon applications, respectively. Taken together, the above results indicate that the repeated application of triadimefon enhanced the degradation rate of the fungicide and the recovery rate of the soil microbial functional diversity. It is concluded that repeated triadimefon applications in soil have a transient or temporary inhibitory effect on soil microbial communities.																			0360-1234						2012	47	2					104	110		10.1080/03601234.2012.616775	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2012.616775								22251210					WOS:000302068400006

Dominant plant species and soil samples were collected to analysis heavy metal (Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd) accumulation characteristics. The results showed that 100% samples for Zn, Pb, Cd, and 87.5% samples for Cu in the investigated area exceeded the Yunnan geochemical background value of the heavy metals in the soil. There were 36 plants species in communities, among which Epilobium pyrricholophum, Elsholtzia argyi, Artemisia vestita, Tripogon chinensis were the dominant species. Plant species, the number of individuals, Ecological Dominance (Do), Shannon-Wiener index (H '), Simpson diversity index (Dsi) and Pielou evenness index (Epi) were affected by Cd and Cu contents of the soil and sediment. Therefore, the results indicate that Cu and Cd contents and ecological risk in the process of long-term vegetation restoration of small catchment in lead-zinc mine waste area should pay more attention.

PESTS IN THE WEST AZERBAIJAN PROVINCE OF IRAN	APPLIED ECOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH												One of the most important renewable resources in nature, is species of Salix alba L. var. alba from Salicaceae family. Salix alba trees are under attack by various pests. Given the importance of S. alba in the West Azerbaijan Province of Iran, S. alba pest species richness was measured in five watersheds. In each region, 10 bases of S. alba species were randomly selected to estimate the indices of species prevalence and richness for S. alba pests. A total of 21 pests species of S. alba was collected from the study area. The highest species richness for pests was estimated in Baranduz, Zangmar and Mahabad in May, July and October with 20.9, 21.9 and 8.9 species (based on rarefaction estimation) respectively. Moreover, the highest Simpson, Shannon, and Brillouin diversity indices observed in Mahabad region were 0.87, 3.39, and 3.34, respectively which suggest this area has the highest diversity of pest in entire study area. The findings of this study suggests that difference in climatic conditions and occurrence of different subspecies of S. alba may be the driving forces behind the various patterns of pest diversity observed in the study areas.																			1589-1623	1785-0037					2017	15	3					1227	1242		10.15666/aeer/1503_12271242	http://dx.doi.org/10.15666/aeer/1503_12271242													WOS:000403811200088

Location Taiwan. Methods Kriging, co-kriging and simulated annealing are applied to estimate and simulate the spatial patterns of bird diversity. In addition, kriging and co-kriging with a genetic algorithm are used to optimally select further samples to improve the kriging and co-kriging estimations. The association between bird diversity and elevation, and bird diversity and land cover, is analysed with estimated and simulated maps. Results The Simpson index correlates spatially with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) within the micro-scale and the macro-scale in the study basin, but the Shannon diversity index only correlates spatially with NDVI within the micro-scale. Co-kriging and simulated annealing simulation accurately simulate the statistical and spatial patterns of bird diversity. The mean estimated diversity and the simulated diversity increase with elevation and decrease with increasing urbanization. The proposed optimal sampling approach selects 43 additional sampling sites with a high spatial estimation variance in bird diversity. Main conclusions Small-scale variations dominate the total spatial variation of the observed diversity due to a lack of spatial information and insufficient sampling. However, simulations of bird diversity consistently capture the sampling statistics and spatial patterns of the observed bird diversity. The data thus accumulated can be used to understand the spatial patterns of bird diversity associated with different types of land cover and elevation, and to optimize sample selection. Co-kriging combined with a genetic algorithm yields additional optimal sampling sites, which can be used to augment existing sampling points in future studies of bird diversity.

Accordingly, in this study, the diversity of zooplankton in rice fields in Suphan Buri Province, a large area of rice plantations in the central region of Thailand, was examined. A total of 100 species, including 52 rotifers, 18 cladocerans, and 30 copepods, were recorded, including Mesocyclops kayi, which was a new record in Thailand. A high Simpson's diversity index (0.63) and a low Pielou's species evenness index (0.02) confirmed various potential niches for zooplankton in this ecosystem, leading to a low Jaccard similarity index both among the current rice fields and those in other regions. Moreover, the species richness estimators suggested that more species are expected to be discovered in the rice fields. Rotifer and copepod communities are influenced by local environmental variables, including dissolved oxygen, salinity, conductivity, and chlorophyll a. The results of this study fill a gap in the knowledge regarding the diversity and ecology of zooplankton in rice fields. However, further research is needed to fully comprehend the function of this ecosystem and the actual diversity in Thailand.					wongkamhaeng, koraon/E-6244-2010	wongkamhaeng, koraon/0000-0001-7671-8869														1424-2818				OCT	2023	15	10							1054	10.3390/d15101054	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d15101054													WOS:001096630200001

CERNE												Background: We conducted a study about how to determine best diversity ordering method for a community data set. Using 12 hypothetical and one ecological datasets, we tested the performances of 20 diversity ordering (divo) methods based on four criteria. Number of intersections (ints) amongst the diversity curves was taken the most important criterion into account. We defined the other criteria considering whether parametric values of a divo method contains SHD (species richness, Shannon entropy and Simpson index), potentially uSHD (unbiased values of SHD), and potentially true species diversity, tSHD (bias corrected values as effective number of SHD). All the criteria were collected into an equation called the relative selection value, rVdi.Results: According to the rVdi values of hypothetical community data sets, the best performances in seven community data sets were provided by N alpha. This was followed by intrinsic diversity related methods with five community data sets. For ecological data set, the best results were obtained from the methods, (i,Mi), (log i,ki) and N alpha, with the rVdi values of 6.883, 6.881 and 6.859, respectively. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the characteristics of community data sets play important role in defining the best diversity ordering method. This tells us that diversity is certainly a multifaceted phenomenon for a single community but perhaps it is a single phenomenon for a group of communities.

Diversity of Mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) Attracted to Human Subjects in Rubber Plantations, Secondary Forests, and Villages in Luang Prabang Province, Northern Lao PDR	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY												The impact of the rapid expansion of rubber plantations in South-East Asia on mosquito populations is uncertain. We compared the abundance and diversity of adult mosquitoes using human-baited traps in four typical rural habitats in northern Lao PDR: secondary forests, immature rubber plantations, mature rubber plantations, and villages. Generalized estimating equations were used to explore differences in mosquito abundance between habitats, and Simpson's diversity index was used to measure species diversity. Over nine months, 24,927 female mosquitoes were collected, including 51 species newly recorded in Lao PDR. A list of the 114 mosquito species identified is included. More mosquitoes, including vector species, were collected in the secondary forest than immature rubber plantations (rainy season, odds ratio [OR] 0.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31-0.36; dry season, 0.46, 95% CI 0.41-0.51), mature rubber plantations (rainy season, OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.23-0.27; dry season, OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.22-0.28), and villages (rainy season, OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.12-0.14; dry season, 0.20, 95% CI 0.18-0.23). All habitats showed high species diversity (Simpson's indexes between 0.82-0.86) with vectors of dengue, Japanese encephalitis (JE), lymphatic filariasis, and malaria. In the secondary forests and rubber plantations, Aedes albopictus (Skuse), a dengue vector, was the dominant mosquito species, while in the villages, Culex vishnui (Theobald), a JE vector, was most common. This study has increased the overall knowledge of mosquito fauna in Lao PDR. The high abundance of Ae. albopictus in natural and man-made forests warrants concern, with vector control measures currently only implemented in cities and villages.

The structure of soil fungal genera of three field soil was studied. In soil of Tierra Blanca, an orchard pecan of 51 years, there were isolated 23 genera of soil fungi, and only 12 genera of other two field soils (El Chupon, a pecan orchard of 14 years, and San Jorge, culturing with alfalfa). For each genus of soil fungi there were calculated the Importance Value Index (I V I). The genus Fusarium showed the greater I V I of the three field soils (71-98). The diversity (Shannon's index) of genera of fungi was different from each soil according to confidence intervals (95%), with values of 1.89, 1.72 y 1.19 for Tierra Blanca, El Chupon and San Jorge, respectively. Additional ecological indexes were calculated, as Simpson, maxim richness (H' max), regularity (F). The values of Index Simpson and F were similar between Tierra Blanca and San Jorge, but only H' max was similar between El Chupon and San Jorge. The similarity index of Shoresen was equal for Tierra Blanca vs. El Chupon, or Tierra Blanca vs. San Jorge (51.4), whereas El Chupon vs. San Jorge was 58.3. The index B for the genera of fungi in Tierra Blanca vs. El Chupon or Tierra Blanca vs. San Jorge was 0.48, but San Jorge vs. El Chupon was 0.83. The genera of soil fungi found in La Laguna are 67-75% similar to soil fungi isolated from desert, such as the Israel desert, but in soils of La Laguna the structure of genera fungal is different; here Fusarium is the most abundant, and appear new genera such as Trichoderma. The changes of soil mycobiota could be the result of the effect of agricultural activity during the last 50 years.																			1870-3453	2007-8706				DEC	2007	78	2					383	390																WOS:000251946100015
J	Sahli, HF; Conner, JK				Sahli, Heather F.; Conner, Jeffrey K.			Characterizing ecological generalization in plant-pollination systems	OECOLOGIA												Despite the development of diversity indices in community ecology that incorporate both richness and evenness, pollination biologists commonly use only pollinator richness to estimate generalization. Similarly, while pollination biologists have stressed the utility of pollinator importance, incorporating both pollinator abundance and effectiveness, importance values have not been included in estimates of generalization in pollination systems. In this study, we estimated pollinator generalization for 17 plant species using Simpson's diversity index, which includes richness and evenness. We compared these estimates with estimates based on only pollinator richness, and compared diversity estimates calculated using importance data with those using only visitation data. We found that pollinator richness explains only 57-65% of the variation in diversity, and that, for most plant species, pollinator importance was determined primarily by differences in visitation rather than by differences in effectiveness. While simple richness may suffice for broad comparisons of pollinator generalization, measures that incorporate evenness will provide a much more accurate understanding of generalization. Although incorporating labor-intensive measurements of pollinator effectiveness are less necessary for broad surveys, effectiveness estimates will be important for detailed studies of some plant species. Unfortunately, at this point it is impossible to predict a priori which species these are.

Dams and hydroelectric power plants also threaten the habitat quality and biodiversity of the river. This research contains investigation of Diptera fauna in Yesilirmak River and tributaries, determination ecological characteristics of the collecting sites according to System A and System B Classification of Water Framework Directive (WFD), assessment of water quality of the studied sites by measuring the physicochemical variables (water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, NO2-N, NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P) and using some metrics (abundance, number of taxa, Simpson Diversity Index, Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index, Margalef Diversity Index, Evenness). Thirty-three (33) sites were sampled from Yesilirmak River and its tributaries in June 2010. Diptera individuals were detected in 20 of them. Two thousand four hundred forty-five (2445) individuals belonging to 12 families and 16 taxa were identified in 20 sampling sites. The water quality classes of the studied sites were Class III (moderate pollution) and Class IV (heavily pollution) according to values of physicochemical variables.

Soil nematode communities were studied in four differents crop systems at the Integrated System of Agroecological Production. Soil samples were collected at four-month intervals during one year, with three replications for each location. Nematode communities were measured by the following parameters: family richness, Shannon-Weaner's index, Simpson's index, trophic diversity (T) and dominance index (Ig). These data were submitted to ANOVA statistical analysis at 5% level of Tukey's test. The population of bacterivores and herbivore nematodes was high in all areas. Omnivores were found in lower abundance in all systems. The highest diversity of nematode families was found on pasture. In forests, the values of richness and abundance were always lower but constant in time, suggesting an ecosystem of higher stability. Soil management induced the proliferation of bacterivores usually associated with higher decomposition rates of organic matter. Herbivores and bacterivores were dominant in all systems, suggesting it is important to have high root (for pasture) or high decomposition rates (for horticulture system). The relative distribution of trophic groups of soil nematodes proved to be a good way to determine the level of perturbation of ecosystems.					berbara, ricardo l/AAE-4318-2020; Agronomy, Acta Scientiarum/AAB-4532-2020; Berbara, Ricardo Luis Louro/F-6672-2012	berbara, ricardo l/0000-0002-9133-7754; Berbara, Ricardo Luis Louro/0000-0002-3649-9443													1807-8621					APR-JUN	2011	33	2					223	229		10.4025/actasciagron.v33i2.4716	http://dx.doi.org/10.4025/actasciagron.v33i2.4716													WOS:000291296500005

It is then necessary for understanding the ecological impacts of invasive plants on neighbouring plant communities where they are found. This study aimed to assess the impacts of the abundance of Pneumatopteris afra on plant diversity of some invaded wetlands in Lafia, Nigeria. Three wetlands with size 500 x 500 m2 each were chosen. Forty 1.5 m x 1.5 m quadrats were laid at 10 m intervals across four 200 m transects at each wetland. The abundance of each plant species within the quadrats was counted and was used to estimate the diversity indices. The impact of the abundance of P. afra on the wetland communities was determined using Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression models. A total of nine neighbouring plant species including P. afra were identified in all the sites. P. afra has the highest relative frequency and abundance in all the sites. Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices of all the sites are less than 2 showing that they are less diverse. The abundance of P. afra exhibited negative relationships with the diversity indices. Regression models also showed inverse relationships between P. afra and the diversity indices. The colonization of these wetlands by P. afra might be due to its ability to max-imize disturbances and limit the growth and expansion of surrounding plants.(c) 2021 Ecological Society of China.

This study investigated whether soil microbial functional diversity is associated with interactions between fertilizer pH and FOC spore inoculate. Method: Pseudostems (n = 180) were grown in pots in mixed soil (pH 6. 09). In a 3 x5 design, each pot was inoculated with 0, 103, or 106 cfu FOC/g of soil, and irrigated each week with pH 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 fertilizer; N, P2O5, and K2O were identical. At 65 days, spore suspensions were prepared from soil samples. Community level physiological profiling (CLPP) was conducted, using the Biolog EcoPlate method, through indices of carbon source utilization that reflect the metabolic functional diversity of soil microbes: average well color development (AWCD), richness (R), Shannon-Weaver diversity index (H'), and the Simpson dominance index (D). Principal component analysis (PCA) of the functional diversity of microbes was applied. Results: AWCD was significantly higher in treatments consisting of no FOC inoculate and alkaline fertilizer compared with other treatments, and R, H', and D were also notably higher (72 h). Results of PCA revealed that the diversity of soil microbes was higher under alkaline fertilizer treatment, but lower under conditions of FOC inoculation. Conclusions: The application of alkaline fertilizer increases the functional diversity of soil microbial populations.																					978-1-912407-84-2				2019							86	96		10.25236/isafb.2019.017	http://dx.doi.org/10.25236/isafb.2019.017													WOS:000670872300017
J	Curtin, IJ; Tobin, D; Reynolds, T				Curtin, Isabel Juliet; Tobin, Daniel; Reynolds, Travis			Do Wealth and Market Access Explain Inconsistent Relationships between Crop Diversity and Dietary Diversity? Evidence from 10 Sub-Saharan African Countries	SUSTAINABILITY												Despite the robust literature base that has explored links between household crop diversity and children's dietary diversity, evidence continues to yield mixed results regarding the efficacy of crop diversity in improving childhood dietary outcomes. Given the variance in the association between agrobiodiversity and dietary diversity, we identified wealth and distance to markets as potential factors that may impact these relationships. Through a series of Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regressions, this study examines the associations between crop diversity and dietary diversity among households at different levels of wealth in 10 sub-Saharan African countries. Drawing on the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series and Demographic and Health Surveys system, we find that the significance and direction of the association between crop diversity (as proxied using the Simpsons Diversity Index) and children's dietary diversity (as measured using the Household Dietary Diversity Score) vary by wealth quintile across countries and households: in richer households, crop diversity has a negative effect on dietary diversity, and in poorer households, there is no significant effect. This study indicates the need to understand contextual factors that impact the relationship between agricultural diversity and dietary diversity to inform development policies.

Environmental yeast communities in vineyards in the mountains of Santa Catarina State, Brazil	WORLD JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY & BIOTECHNOLOGY												Yeasts were isolated from three vineyards located in the South Region of Brazil. A cross evaluation was carried out at the oldest vineyard of the study in Pinheiro Preto. Samples of grape berries, grapevine leaves and the soil, along with samples of the winery equipment and effluent, were collected. In the Serra do Marari and Campos Novos vineyards only samples of grape clusters were obtained. The 106 yeast isolates were identified by sequencing the D1/D2 domain of LSU rDNA or ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region in 22 species. The values for the richness indices varied between the vineyards. A comparison of the taxonomic diversity of the yeasts from these regions using the reciprocal Simpson index showed a significant difference between the Serra do Marari and Campos Novos vineyards (5.72 +/- 0.36 and 2.92 +/- 0.36, respectively, p < 0.0001). The functional diversity was assessed in relation to the use of carbon and nitrogen sources by the yeasts isolated from each location. In general, we observed that the Pinheiro Preto and Campos Novos vineyards differed consistently from the Serra do Marari vineyard according to these indices (FAD2, FDc and Rao, p < 0.0001). The possible spreading of Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the winery to the vineyard in Pinheiro Preto was observed.

They comprise a group of organisms largely overlooked in biodiversity estimates because they are hard to collect and identify, and their collection causes disturbance that is unsustainable in light of widespread reef degradation. Artificial substrate units (ASUs) provide a better sampling alternative and have the potential to enhance biodiversity estimates. The present study examines the effectiveness of ASUs made with defaunated coral rubble to estimate the diversity of motile cryptic crustaceans in the back-reef zone of the Puerto Morelos Reef National Park, Mexico. Species richness, Simpson's diversity index, Shannon-Wiener index and the composition of assemblages were compared between ASUs and samples from the surrounding coral rubble substrate. A combined total of 2,740 specimens of 178 different species, belonging to five orders of Crustacea (Amphipoda, Cumacea, Isopoda, Tanaidacea and Decapoda) were collected. Species richness was higher in the surrounding coral rubble and Shannon-Wiener and Simpson indexes were higher in ASUs. Species composition differed between methods, with only 71 species being shared among sampling methods. Decapoda was more speciose in ASUs and Peracarids in the surrounding coral rubble. Combining the use of ASUs with surrounding rubble provided a better inventory of motile cryptic crustacean biodiversity, as 65% of the species were represented by one or two specimens.

Centers for Disease Control traps, baited with blue, green, and warm white light-emitting diodes (LEDs), as test group, and incandescent light, as control group, were used. The electromagnetic spectra and luminous intensities of the light sources were characterized. Fractional vegetation cover at each sampling site was also estimated. Abundance, richness, rarefaction curves, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, phlebotomines/trap/hour, and phlebotomines/trap/night were estimated and compared. The light sources of the test group presented greater luminous intensity than the control, but were similar to each other. There were no differences in vegetation cover at each site. A total of 1,346 phlebotomines comprising 11 species were sampled. The most abundant species were as follows: Nyssomyia antunesi (Coutinho, 1939), Trichophoromyia ubiquitalis (Mangabeira, 1942), Bichromomyia flaviscutellata (Mangabeira, 1942), and Th. brachipyga (Mangabeira, 1942). Light traps with LEDs had richness, abundance, and Shannon diversity indices similar to those obtained with incandescent light. The warm white LED had a higher Simpson's index than the other light sources. Phlebotomine responses to incandescent light were similar to those to LEDs in most analyses, confirming the applicability of these light sources as alternative devices for entomological surveillance. Low consumption ensures greater autonomy of the traps, providing better operability during fieldwork.					dos Santos, Thiago Vasconcelos/AAE-8173-2021	dos Santos, Thiago Vasconcelos/0000-0002-0229-4861													0022-2585	1938-2928				2023 DEC 29	2023										10.1093/jme/tjad165	http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jme/tjad165		DEC 2023						38157321					WOS:001133647300001

Alpine grasslands are the dominant ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau, albeit little is known about the microbial community and diversity among different alpine grassland types. Here, soil bacterial composition and diversity in the upper soils of five alpine grassland ecosystems, alpine meadow (AM), alpine steppe (AS), alpine meadow steppe (AMS), alpine desert (AD), and alpine desert steppe (ADS), were investigated based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing technology. Actinobacteria (46.12%) and Proteobacteria (29.67%) were the two dominant soil bacteria at the phylum level in alpine grasslands. There were significant differences in the relative abundance at the genus level among the five different grassland types, especially for the Rubrobacter, Solirubrobacter, Pseudonocardia, Gaiella, Haliangium, and Geodermatophilus. Six alpha diversity indices were calculated based on the operational taxonomic units (OTUs), including Good's coverage index, phylogenetic diversity (PD) whole tree index, Chao1 index, observed species index, Shannon index, and Simpson index. The Good's coverage index value was around 0.97 for all the grassland types in the study area, meaning the soil bacteria samplings sequenced sufficiently. No statistically significant difference was shown in other diversity indices' value, indicating the similar richness and evenness of soil bacteria in these alpine grasslands. The beta diversity, represented by Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and the non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS), showed that OTUs were clustered within alpine grasslands, indicating a clear separation of soil bacterial communities. In addition, soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), pH, and soil water content (SWC) were closely related to the variations in soil bacterial compositions. These results indicated that soil bacterial taxonomic compositions were similar, while soil bacterial community structures were different among the five alpine grassland types. The environmental conditions, including SOM, TN, TP, pH, and SWC, might influence the soil bacterial communities on the Tibetan Plateau.					wang, ziwei/HQY-9921-2023														2296-701X					FEB 16	2021	9								630722	10.3389/fevo.2021.630722	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fevo.2021.630722													WOS:000624074500001

Methods: The reported HFMD cases were collected in Changsha from 2009 to 2017. The traditional descriptive method and a new method (index system) including six indices (richness index N, Simpson diversity index D, Shannon diversity index H, Berger-Parker dominance index d, Shannon evenness index E, and Morisita?Horn similarity index C) were used to describe the epidemiological characteristics of HFMD in Changsha. Results: There were 214155 HFMD reported in Changsha during the study period. The incidence of the disease was higher in even-numbered years (2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016) than in uneven-numbered years (2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2017), with two peaks in May to June and October to November every year. The age of onset was mainly from 0 to 5?years old, and the death was mainly from 0 to 2?years old. According to occupational classification, districts and counties (cities) had a high degree of similarity of the composition of HFMD, and there was no regional difference. Conclusions: Changsha had a yearly increasing trend of HFMD from 2009 to 2017, and the key population for prevention and control was children aged in 0?5?years old. Seasonal distribution of high incidence and peak incidence were occurred in even-numbered years. The sub-regions of the city shared moderate diversity and high similarity of occupational distribution of HFMD.																			2374-4235	2374-4243				2020 JAN 2	2020	52	1					39	44		10.1080/23744235.2019.1675902	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/23744235.2019.1675902		OCT 2019						31596157					WOS:000490263300001

AQUATIC INVERTEBRATE PRODUCTION IN MOIST-SOIL MANAGED WETLANDS ON RICHLAND CREEK WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA, EAST-CENTRAL TEXAS	SOUTHWESTERN NATURALIST												Aquatic invertebrates have significant value to wetland-dependent species as well as to wetlands themselves. They process organic matter through producer and detritus food webs, modify wetland habitats, and provide a food resource to wetland-dependent species such as waterfowl and shorebirds. Timely flooding and drawdown of water within moist-soil managed wetlands will increase invertebrate diversity and abundance, allowing wetland managers to maximize the production of such areas. We examined how flood timing and duration influenced aquatic invertebrate density, diversity, richness, and production within four moist-soil managed wetlands on Richland Creek Wildlife Management Area, east-central Texas from January 2004 through December 2006. A total of 12,089 aquatic invertebrates from 41 aquatic invertebrate families were collected. Overall, diversity indices were 0.76 (Simpson's Index) and 2.47 (Shannon-Wiener Index). Most common aquatic invertebrates were Crustacea (n = 3,568) and Ephemeroptera (n = 2,080). Differences in aquatic invertebrate density and biomass varied depending on the presence of water over time. Invertebrate community diversity and production peaked early but experienced a nearly sixfold decline over 3 y due to atypical and prolonged inundation regimes in these managed wetlands. Proper inundation duration and timing regimes are key to maintaining invertebrate community diversity and production in moist-soil managed wetlands.

J	Ayodeji, AO; Kilishi, HS				Ayodeji, Adebayo Olaoluwa; Kilishi, Halidu Shafiu			Avifauna Species Diversity and Abundance in Kainji Lake National Park, Niger State, Nigeria	JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE AND BIODIVERSITY												The dearth of understanding the importance of bird species diversity and abundance contributes to the low rate of conservation and distribution of wildlife species in the ecosystem. Diversity and abundance are equally important factors for improving the ecological system. This study examined bird species diversity and abundance in Borgu Sector of Kainji Lake National Park, Niger State, Nigeria. Line transect method was used to carry out birds' survey at five different tracks, namely: Hussaini Mashi, Gilbert Child, Bukar Shuaib, Shehu Shagari and Mahmud Lapai Tracks. Data were obtained on birds' species and abundance through the use of point count for bird survey. Frequency counts, percentages, means, Shannon-Weiner diversity Index, Simpson's Diversity Index, Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to analyse data. A total number of 70 bird species in 31 families were recorded during the survey. Shannon-Weiner diversity Index results showed that Mahmud Lapai track had the highest diversity (4.185) compared to Hussaini Mashi (3.726), Gilbert Child (3.928), Shehu Shagari (4.106) and Bukar Shuaib (4.135) tracks respectively. The results also indicated that bird species diversity was not equally distributed in the tracks. ANOVA showed that bird species abundance was normally distributed and varied significantly (p < 0.05) among the study sites. The study concluded that bird species diversity and abundance are key contributors to a healthy ecological system. Birds are good indicators of the biological network thereby revealing the status of the park environmental degradation. The study recommended that stakeholders should improve on the enactment, legislation and enforcement of laws that will safeguard areas where fauna and flora are effectively conserved.																				2588-3526				SUM-FAL	2019	3	4					16	26		10.22120/jwb.2019.104859.1058	http://dx.doi.org/10.22120/jwb.2019.104859.1058													WOS:000478775500003

Genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops, which were developed to minimize the losses caused by weeds, have gradually become the most widely adopted genetically modified crops in the world due to their economic and environmental benefits. However, the potential ecological and environmental risks of GMHT crops have attracted extensive attention and controversy. Arthropod communities form a prominent part of the biodiversity of agroecosystems and are important indicators of environmental health. Elucidating the effects of GMHT crops on the diversity of arthropod communities is necessary to ensure the safety of GMHT crops. Result In this 2-year study, we investigated the potential impact of GMHT crops on arthropod communities. The GMHT cotton variety GGK2 with glyphosate tolerance and its near-isogenic non-GMHT variety K312 were used for the experimental groups. The Shannon diversity index (H), Simpson diversity index (D), Pielou evenness index (J), and principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) of the Bray-Curtis distance were used to evaluate the population dynamics and biodiversity of arthropods in cotton fields. No significant differences were found between GGK2 and K312 in their total abundance of arthropod communities, and biodiversity indexes on most sampling dates. The arthropod composition in the GGK2 and K312 plots was similar. Sampling dates had a significant effect on biodiversity indexes, whereas no clear tendencies related to cotton variety or cotton variety x sampling dates interaction were recorded. In addition, PCoA revealed high similarity between the arthropod communities in the plots of the GMHT cotton variety GGK2 and its near-isogenic variety K312. Conclusion There was no obvious difference in abundance, diversity indexes of arthropod communities between GMHT cotton variety GGK2 and its near-isogenic variety K312 under the small-scale planting regime.

The potential effect of antibiotics on the milk microbiome is still not clear. Therefore, the objective of this research was to investigate the effect of 2 commonly used cephalosporins on the milk microbiota of dairy cows and the antibiotic resistance genes in the milk. The milk samples were collected from 7 dairy cows at the period before medication (d 0), medication (d 1, 2, 3), withdrawal period (d 4, 6, 8), and the period after withdrawal (d 9, 11, 13, 15). We applied 16S rRNA sequencing to explore the microbiota changes, and antibiotic resistance patterns were investigated by quantitative PCR. The microbiota richness and diversity in each sample were calculated using the Chao 1 (richness), Shannon (diversity), and Simpson (diversity) indices. The cephalosporins treatment lowered the Simpson diversity value at the period of withdrawal. Members of the Enterobacter genera were the most affected bacteria associated with mastitis. Meanwhile, antibiotic resistance genes in the milk were also influenced by antibiotic treatment. The cephalosporins treatment raised the proportion of bla(TEM) in milk samples at the period of withdrawal. Therefore, the treatment of cephalosporins led to change in the milk microbiota and increase of beta-lactam resistance gene in the milk at the time of withdrawal period.

J	Singh, JK				Singh, Jitendra Kumar			Structural characteristics of mangrove forest in different coastal habitats of Gulf of Khambhat arid region of Gujarat, west coast of India	HELIYON												Tropical mangroves are most productive and highly sensitive to environmental change and act as good bioindicators of the environmental quality and health of any coastal ecosystem. The present study initiated to know the current ecological status of mangrove species at four selected study sites namely Bhavnagar (Ghogha coast), Bharuch (Dahej coast), Surat (Dumas beach) and Navsari (Purna estuaries), Gulf of Khambhat, Gujarat, India. Observation for a period of one year from January 2014 to December 2014. Mangroves were evaluated for their community structures at each site by standard quadrant method and different diversity indices were used for characterize the species diversity in a mangrove community. The mangrove forest habitat supports the occurrence of a total 16 species (6 mangrove species and 10 associated plant species), 15 species occurred at Navsari, whereas 7, 6 and 10 species occurred at Bhavnagar, Bharuch and Surat respectively. Out of six mangrove species, Avicennia marina was found to be most dominant and abundant mangroves occurring among all the four study locations. The most abundant and dominant mangrove associates were Suaeda maritima and Sesuvium portulacastrum. Simpson's diversity index was varied at a range of zero to 0.6538, showing the presence of less mangrove diversity. Navsari site presented higher diversity with Shannon and Wiener Species Diversity Index of 1.179 in comparison to other sites. The present study revealed that the species abundance, density and diversity of flora associates depend upon species density and diversity of mangroves. Therefore, mangrove forest habitats need to be protected and regular assess.

J	Frunze, NI				Frunze, N. I.			Diversity of amino acids in a typical chernozem of Moldova	EURASIAN SOIL SCIENCE												The content and composition of the amino acids in typical chernozems were studied. The objects of the study included a reference soil under an old fallow and three variants under fodder crop rotations: not fertilized, with mineral fertilizers, and with organic fertilizers. The contents of 18 amino acids were determined in these soils. The amino acids were extracted by the method of acid hydrolysis and identified by the method of ion-exchange chromatography. The total content of most of the amino acids was maximal in the reference soil; it was much lower in the cultivated soils and decreased in the following sequence: organic background > mineral background > no fertilization. The diversity of amino acids was evaluated quantitatively using different parameters applied in ecology for estimating various aspects of the species composition of communities (Simpson, Margalef, Menhinick, and Shannon's indices). The diversity and contribution of different amino acids to the total pool of amino acids also varied significantly in the studied variants. The maximum diversity of amino acids and maximum evenness of their relative abundance indices were typical of the reference chernozem; these parameters were lower in the cultivated soils. It was concluded that the changes in the structure of the amino acids under the impact of agricultural loads are similar to those that are usually observed under stress conditions.

J	Thangavelu, M; Raji, M				Thangavelu, Muthukumar; Raji, Muthuraja			Arbuscular mycorrhizal and dark septate endophyte fungal associations in <i>Asparagus</i>	TURKISH JOURNAL OF BOTANY												We studied the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) and dark septate endophyte (DSE) fungal associations in five species of pot-grown Asparagus (A. aethiopicus, A. densiflorus, A. setaceus, A. racemosus, and A. umbellatus). Root colonization by AM and DSE fungi and AM spore numbers in the soil were assessed. AM fungal diversity indices like species richness, Shannon-Weiner index, Simpson's index, evenness, and Jaccard's index were determined. Relationships among the fungal and soil variables were also examined. All the species of Asparagus examined were colonized by both AM and DSE fungi, and these associations have been reported for the first time in four species. Root colonization by both the fungi varied significantly among Asparagus species and was related to each other and soil factors. The AM colonization patterns reported in four Asparagus species for the first time were characterized by either intermediate or Arum-Paris type. The AM fungal community was dominated by members belonging to the Glomerales and was significantly influenced by Asparagus species and soil factors. We conclude that Asparagus species could support a diverse AM fungal community even under pot conditions; however, certain AM fungal species are sensitive to changes in soil factors and host species.					t, m/GXF-8560-2022; Muthuraja, Raji/AAS-2665-2020; Thangavelu, Muthukumar/U-3371-2018														1300-008X	1303-6106					2016	40	6					662	675		10.3906/bot-1602-11	http://dx.doi.org/10.3906/bot-1602-11													WOS:000390711200010

Within the ENVIRONAGE birth cohort, we collected settled dust and performed 16S and ITS amplicon sequencing and qPCR measurements to characterize the indoor microbiota, including bacterial and fungal loads and Chao1 richness, Shannon, and Simpson diversity indices. For 155 households, we obtained information on the number of indoor plants. We performed linear regression models adjusted for several a priori chosen covariables. Overall, an increase in indoor plants and density was associated with increased microbial diversity, but not load. For example, we found an increase of 64 (95%CI:3;125) and 26 (95%CI:4;48) units of bacterial and fungal taxa richness, respectively, in households with more than three plants compared to no plants. Our results support the hypothesis that indoor plants can enrich indoor microbial diversity, while impacts on microbial loads are not obvious.

J	Jaramillo, CA; Dilcher, DL				Jaramillo, CA; Dilcher, DL			Microfloral diversity patterns of the late Paleocene-Eocene interval in Colombia, northern South America	GEOLOGY												The late Paleocene-early Eocene interval was characterized by a long period of global warming that culminated with the highest temperatures of the Tertiary. This interval was also associated with plant extinctions and a subsequent increase in plant diversity in temperate latitudes. However, tropical regions remain largely unknown. We compare the microfloral diversity of the late Paleocene with the fate early to middle Eocene in flood plain, coastal plain, and estuarine facies of a section in the Colombian eastern Andes. Several techniques such as range-through method, rarefaction, bootstrap, detrended correspondence analysis, and Simpson index were used to assess the significance of the diversity pattern observed throughout the section. The microfloral record indicates a distinct, diverse Paleocene flora declining toward the end of the Paleocene, being replaced by a different and much more diverse Eocene flora. It is uncertain, however, how these floral changes correlate with the latest Paleocene thermal maximum and Eocene thermal maximum events.						jaramillo, carlos/0000-0002-2616-5079													0091-7613	1943-2682				SEP	2000	28	9					815	818																WOS:000089269100012

Knowing its diversity allows establishing functional relationships with it and making decisions to establish conservation practices. The objective of this work was to evaluate the richness (Ri), relative abundance (AR), and diversity of the edaphic fauna in four municipalities of the department of Narino, La Union, Sandona, Consaca y La Florida. The samplings were carried out at three altitudes, which were considered as replicates. In secondary forests and coffee crops, Ri and AR were recorded in mulch, between 10 and 20 cm, and between 20 and 30 cm deep. In Consaca, were registered 19,836 individuals of 24 orders, of which 37.6% corresponded to forest and 62.4% to coffee. Florida showed 13,980 individuals from 16 orders of which 41.3% were located in the forest and 58.7% in coffee. In La Union, were found 6,935 individuals in 17 orders, where 64.2% were located in the forest and 35.8% in coffee. The number of individuals in Sandona was 10,436, of which 10.7% were located in the forest and 89.3% in coffee. In forests, there were higher values of diversity than in coffee crops. The systems x depths interaction was not significant, an exception of the Shannon-Weaver and Simpson indices in Sandona. Hymenoptera, Acari and Coleoptera were the most prevalent with differences in Ri and AR between forest and coffee.

This study compared the differences in tree species diversity, structure, and composition between secondary dry semi-deciduous forests on two previously burned sites; one site had been planted ten-years prior with mixed mahogany species, while the other naturally regenerated after the fire. Density, dominance, frequency and importance value index (IVI) as well as family important values index (FIV) were computed to evaluate the floristic composition. A variety of diversity measures were also employed to examine heterogeneity in each forest type. For both sites, the most abundant diameter-class was 5-10 cm and the most abundant height-class was 1- 10 m. The study recorded significant differences between the two sites with respect to nearly all the indices of species diversity (Simpson, P = 0.037; Shannon, P = 0.003 and species richness, P = 0.003) employed, with the exception of Pielou's index of evenness (P = 0.06). The planted site recorded highest values for all the measures of species diversity. However, Sorensen's similarity index between planted and natural regeneration sites was 0.703. Seventeen and five species respectively were found to be solely associated with the planted and natural regeneration sites. At both sites the four most dominant and abundant tree species which recorded highest importance value index (IVI) were Ficus exasperate, Terminalia superba, Morida lucida, and Antiaris toxicaria. The greatest family importance values (FVI) for both sites were for Moraceae and Fabaceae, especially its sub-family Mimosaceae. The paper concludes that, use of mixed indigenous tree species in restoration facilitate the recruitment of a diverse group of other native tree species.

In this study, gut microbiota of all samples across gut regions and sample types (luminal content and mucosa) were analyzed and compared from two Ethiopian lakes. Microbiota were characterized using 16S rRNA Illumina MiSeq platform sequencing. A total of 2061 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained and the results indicated that Nile tilapia from Lake Chamo harbored a much more diversified gut microbiota than Lake Awassa. In addition, the gut microbiota diversity varied significantly across the gut region based on the Chao1, Shannon and Simpson index. The microbiome analyses of all samples in the midgut region showed significantly higher values for alpha diversity (Chao 1, Shannon and Simpson). Beta diversity analysis revealed a clear separation of samples according to sampling areas and gut regions. The most abundant genera wereClostridium_sensu_stricto andClostridium_XI genera across all samples. Between the two sampling lakes, two phyla, Phylum Fusobacteria and Cyanobacteria, were found to be significantly different. On the other hand, six phyla (Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria) were significantly different across gut regions. In this study, we found that all samples shared a large core microbiota, comprising a relatively large number of OTUs, which was dominated byProteobacteria,Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Fusobacteria andActinobacteria.This study has established the bases for future large-scale investigations of gut microbiota of fishes in Ethiopian lakes.

Variety of gastropods biodiversity associated with natural and anthropogenic factors in Mangrove Forests located at border of Iran and Pakistan	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY												This research was conducted to evaluate the gastropods diversity in mangrove forests located in Iranian part of the Govater Gulf in southern border of Iran and Pakistan. Three transects were selected at the water interface vertically to the end of forest stand. In each transect, samples of sediments containing gastropods were taken at the beginning (lower zones), the middle, and the end (upper zone) points during four continued seasons. Biodiversity (Shannon-Wiener index), dominance (Simpson's dominance index), species evenness (Smith and Wilson evenness index), richness (number of species), and density (number in m(3)) were calculated for each season in sampling points. Data analysis results showed that biodiversity and richness indices changed significantly among different transects. Shannon-Wiener diversity index in transect one (1.90 +/- 0.69) was significantly higher than transect two (1.26 +/- 0.67) and three (1.19 +/- 0.68). Similarly, richness index was the highest in transect one (7.58 +/- 1.53) rather than transect two (4.42 +/- 1.15) and three (3.92 +/- 0.94). Density index changed differently between lower zone (2318.02 +/- 987.76), middle zone (2318.01 +/- 605.75) and upper zone (13,420.71 +/- 176.50). Species evenness showed significant differences between lower (0.65 +/- 0.15) to middle (0.46 +/- 0.20) and upper (0.30 +/- 0.32) zones. Different seasons had no significant effect on richness, density, diversity, and evenness of gastropod species. Consequently, among the natural factors, it is the intertidal zones which increases the environmental stresses such as salinity and humidity was considered, and surprisingly, weak anthropogenic factors, for example, the effect of the transect was positive due to providing nutrient.																			1735-1472	1735-2630				2021 APR	2021	18	4					989	996		10.1007/s13762-020-02887-7	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13762-020-02887-7		AUG 2020											WOS:000560264100002

The soil bacterial community plays an important role in farmland soil restoration; however, few studies have compared the composition and diversity of soil bacteria between the abandoned farmlands (AFS) and selective-farming farmlands (FFS). Here, the effects of AFS and FFS on soil properties and bacterial diversity were evaluated in an antimony (Sb) mining area in southern China. This study aimed to identify effective land management methods in terms of positive or negative changes in soil environment and bacterial diversity. Methods16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing was used to compare the diversity and composition of soil bacteria between AFS and FFS in the Xikuangshan (the largest Sb mine in the world). ResultsCompared to AFS, FFS had higher Sb concentration and nutritional properties (e.g., available N, P, and K) and lower Zn concentration (p < 0.05). The bacterial alpha diversity including Chao1 index, Simpson index, Shannon index and Pielou(-)e index in FFS was higher than AFS (p < 0.05). At the phylum level, FFS had higher relative abundances of Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Gemmatimonadetes, and Rokubacteria, and lower relative abundances of Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. At the genus level, FFS had higher relative abundances of Acidothermus, Haliangium, and Rokubacteriales, and lower relative abundances of Bacillus, Rhodococcus, Sphingomonas, and 67-14. Redundancy analysis indicated that soil heavy metal content and soil fertility were closely correlated with the soil bacterial community. Altogether, selective farming of low-pollution farmland in the mining area can improve soil properties and soil bacterial diversity.					chen, zhiwei/AAP-5465-2020															1664-302X				JUL 22	2022	13								953624	10.3389/fmicb.2022.953624	http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2022.953624								35935219					WOS:000837118900001
J	Goldberg, DE; Estabrook, GF				Goldberg, DE; Estabrook, GF			Separating the effects of number of individuals sampled and competition on species diversity: an experimental and analytic approach	JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												1 Species richness typically increases with the number of individuals sampled, although many ecological processes that influence species richness are also well known to depend on density of individuals. We separated the effects of density on species richness that are due to sampling, from those due to density-dependent ecological processes such as competition or predation, by manipulating the density of an entire community. 2 A seed bank from a community of desert annual plants that occur on semi-stabilized sand dunes in Israel was collected from the field and sown in an experimental garden at a range of densities from 1/16 to eight times the natural density. The species pool observed in the lowest density plots was used as the null community, which was repeatedly sampled to calculate the species richness land other diversity indices) in higher density plots that would be expected from sampling considerations alone. The significance of deviations of observed diversity from this expected diversity was then evaluated. 3 Both observed and expected number of species increased substantially with the experimental increase in density. However, observed species richness, the Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Simpson's diversity index were often significantly lower than that expected based on sampling considerations. The magnitude of the deviation from expected increased significantly with increasing density for richness and the Shannon-Wiener index. This provides some of the first direct experimental evidence from diverse natural assemblages that increasing competition among all the individuals in a community can lead to competitive exclusion.																			0022-0477					DEC	1998	86	6					983	988		10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00319.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2745.1998.00319.x													WOS:000077806000008

To reveal the genetic and clonal structure of this species, nine populations were investigated using ten inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. As compared to other rhizomatous Carex species, C moorcroftii had lower genetic diversity (H-s = 0.10) at population level and higher genetic differentiation (G(st) = 0.66) and lower gene flow (N-m = 0.26) between populations. Clonal diversity in C moorcroftii in terms of Simpson index (D = 0.65) was comparable to that in other clonal species while lower than that in Carex species from the arctic and subarctic areas. The ratio of clonal diversity to genetic variation in C moorcroftii was closely correlated with latitude, enabling a speculation about the northern migration of this species on this plateau.

Effect of trapping methods on the estimation of alpha diversity of a phlebotomine sandfly assemblage in southern Mexico	MEDICAL AND VETERINARY ENTOMOLOGY												The aims of the study were to (a) investigate the effect of trapping methods on alpha diversity; and (b) enhance the knowledge of the sandfly assemblage in the state of Quintana Roo. Field work was undertaken in a tropical forest of southern Mexico from August 2013 to July 2014. Sampling was conducted monthly during three consecutive nights. For each trapping night, 12 different types of trap were operated from 18.00 to 24.00 hours in four transects. Measures of alpha community diversity were based on the quantification of the number of species (Chao 2, Jackknife 2, Clench's equation, Margalef's index) and the community structure, as well as the dominance (Simpson and Berger-Parker indexes) and evenness (Shannon's entropy index, true diversity of the Jost and Pielou index). With a total sampling effort of 1728 night-traps, 16 101 phlebotomine sandflies were collected; they represented two genera and 13 species. Diversity estimates of 100% (Chao 2 and Clench's equation) and 85% (Jackknife 2) of potential species in the study area were calculated. Shannon traps and CDC light traps indicated the largest number of species, but only Shannon traps showed the greatest abundance. This inventory of sandflies is an important activity to enhance our knowledge of sandfly assemblages and guilds. The ultimate goal of studying alpha diversity in sandflies would be to have a better understanding of the population dynamics and all complex networks of interactions that may, in turn, be associated with the epidemiology of the disease.

What are the features of a good biodiversity index? How should trends in abundance of individual species be estimated? How should composite indices, possibly spanning very diverse taxa, be formed? At what spatial scale should composite indices be applied? How might change-points-points at which the underlying trend changes-be identified? We address some of the technical issues underlying composite indices, including survey design, weighting of the constituent indices, identification of change-points and estimation of spatially varying time trends. We suggest some criteria that biodiversity measures for use in monitoring surveys should satisfy, and we discuss the problems of implementing rigorous methods. We illustrate the properties of different composite indices using UK farmland bird data. We conclude that no single index can capture all aspects of biodiversity change, but that a modified Shannon index and the geometric mean of relative abundance have useful properties.

Persistence of the herbicide butachlor in soil after repeated applications and its effects on soil microbial functional diversity	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND HEALTH PART B-PESTICIDES FOOD CONTAMINANTS AND AGRICULTURAL WASTES												Effects of repeated applications of the herbicide butachlor (N-(butoxymethyl)-2-chloro -N-2',6'-dimethyl acetanilide) in soil on its persistence and soil microbial functional diversity were investigated under laboratory conditions. The degradation half-lives of butachlor at the recommended dosage in soil were calculated to be 12.5, 4.5, and 3.2 days for the first, second, and third applications, respectively. Throughout this study, no significant inhibition of the Shannon-Wiener index H' was observed. However, the Simpson index 1/D and McIntosh index U were significantly reduced (P 0.05) during the initial 3 days after the first application of butachlor, and thereafter gradually recovered to a similar level to that of the control soil. A similar variation but faster recovery in 1/D and U was observed after the second and third Butachlor applications. Therefore, repeated applications of butachlor led to more rapid degradation of the herbicide, and more rapid recovery of soil microorganisms. It is concluded that repeated butachlor applications in soil had a temporary or short-term inhibitory effect on soil microbial communities.																			0360-1234	1532-4109					2009	44	2					123	129	PII 907447352	10.1080/03601230802599035	http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601230802599035								19130370					WOS:000262296100004

Diversity analysis showed that the Shannon index, the Simpson index, the abundance-based coverage estimator (ACE) index, and the Chao1 index of the intestinal samples of the three commercial fish species were all lower in spring than in autumn, indicating that the richness of the intestinal microbiota of these three commercial fish species was lower. At the phylum level, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota, and Bacteroidota were dominant among the intestinal microbiota of the three commercial fish species. Analysis of the composition and structure of the intestinal microbial community showed that the IMD and the community structure of the three commercial fish species were similar in a given season but differed significantly in different seasons. This study shows that the IMD and community structure of fish were significantly affected by season and feeding habits.

Infra-annual variability is seldom investigated within tropical gradients, when it might influence diversity patterns. Two altitudinal gradients were compared here in tropical forests on two mountains, Mount Wilhelm (Papua New Guinea, 200-3,700 m.a.s.l) and Doi Imitation (Thailand, 400-2,556 m.a.s.l), during the corresponding early wet-season sampling periods, to test a general spatial pattern of species diversity within tropical Auchenorrhyncha assemblages. We investigate the impact of selecting a seasonally optimal sampling period on determination of overall species diversity patterns. Shannon and Simpson diversity indices decreased as elevation increased on both gradients, as did species richness and abundance on Mount Wilhelm. Cluster analysis revealed numerous differences in altitudinal composition of dominant families between gradients. Our results revealed (1) the optimal sampling period with distinct seasonal variability in the diversity of assemblages, (2) that sampling only at an optimal period, had consequences on the number and the kind of species and families collected, but not on the diversity pattern, and (3) that the decrease of diversity indices with increasing elevation for the Auchenorrhyncha is not restricted to a local tropical gradient.

This study developed the Residual Livelihood Ratio (RLR) and the Livelihood Simpson Index (LSI) to measure the transformation of farmers' livelihood in China, and applied the multiple regression model to explore the influence of the transformation of farmers' livelihood on the labor cost of grain production. The results show that because of the soaring increment in labor cost, the net profit of rice, wheat, and maize production decreased largely in China. The LSI increased, while the RLR decreased, which indicated that farmers' livelihoods transitioned towards a more unbalanced income-expenditure but more flexible employment. The Residual Livelihood Ratio; the mechanization input; the grain yield per unit area; the non-grain plantation degree; and the non-agricultural land use degree showed negative impacts on labor cost in grain production, whereas the Livelihood Simpson Index and Engel's coefficient of farmers showed positive impacts on the labor cost. This paper proposes targeted policy implications for labor cost control of the grain production in China.																				2071-1050				NOV	2021	13	21							11637	10.3390/su132111637	http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su132111637													WOS:000719245800001

While microbial communities in low-carbon, saturated, subsurface soils showed dominance, microbial communities in low-carbon surface soils showed remarkably uniform distributions, and all species were equally abundant. Two diversity indices, the reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D) and the log series index, effectively distinguished between the dominant and uniform diversity patterns. For example, the uniform profiles characteristic of the surface communities had diversity index values that were 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than those for the high-dominance, saturated, subsurface communities. In a site richer in organic carbon, microbial communities consistently, exhibited the uniform distribution pattern regardless of soil water content and depth. The uniform distribution implies that competition does not shape the structure of these microbial communities. Theoretical studies based on mathematical modeling suggested that spatial isolation could limit competition in surface soils, thereby supporting the high diversity and a uniform community structure. Carbon resource heterogeneity may explain the uniform diversity patterns observed in the high-carbon samples even in the saturated zone. Very high levels of chromium contamination (e.g., >20%) in the high-organic-matter soils did not greatly reduce the diversity. Understanding mechanisms that may control community structure, such as spatial isolation, has important implications for preservation of biodiversity, management of microbial communities for bioremediation, biocontrol of root diseases, and improved soil fertility.

Despite drastically increasing amounts of 16S rRNA gene targeting pyrosequencing data, sampling and data interpretation for comparative analysis have not yet been standardized. For more accurate bacterial diversity analyses, the influences of soil heterogeneity and sequence resolution on bacterial diversity estimates were investigated using pyrosequencing data of oak and pine forest soils with focus on the bacterial 16SrRNA gene. Soil bacterial community sets were phylogenetically clustered into two separate groups by forest type. Rarefaction curves showed that bacterial communities sequenced from the DNA mixtures and the DNAs of the soil mixtures had midsize richness compared with other samples. Richness and diversity estimates were highly variable depending on the sequence read numbers. Bacterial richness estimates (ACE, Chao 1 and Jack) of the forest soils had positive linear relationships with the sequence read number. Bacterial diversity estimates (NPShannon, Shannon and the inverse Simpson) of the forest soils were also positively correlated with the sequence read number. One-way ANOVA shows that sequence resolution significantly affected the alpha-diversity indices (P<0.05), but the soil heterogeneity did not (P>0.05). For an unbiased evaluation, richness and diversity estimates should be calculated and compared from subsets of the same size.

We estimated species richness and calculated the total beta diversity based on Sorensen's dissimilarity index (beta sor). We estimated the species turnover using Simpson's dissimilarity index (beta sim). We then evaluated the nesting (beta sne) by the difference between the dissimilarity indices (beta sor and beta sim). Based on this analysis, we identified the priority areas for the conservation of bats in the Cerrado based on the zonation approach. We found that the species richness and beta diversity of bats in the Cerrado are concentrated primarily in the central and northern portions of the biome. We also discovered that the conservation units of the Cerrado are ineffective for the protection of species with a restricted distribution (<= 150 grid cells), such as Vampyrum spectrum, for which we propose the creation of new conservation units that better cover the diversity patterns observed in the present study. By conserving this diversity, we will also be protecting local habitats, which will in turn enable the survival of a wide range of species, and provide the ecosystems with the capacity to respond adequately to future changes in the environment.

Effect of sand-dune slope orientation on soil free-living nematode abundance and diversity	HELMINTHOLOGIA												The spatial and temporal dynamics and composition of a soil free-living nematode community were studied in order to determine the impact of slope orientation on the community on the xeric south- and the mesic north-facing sand-dune slopes. A significant effect of sampling location on organic matter, total number of free-living nematodes, and trophic diversity was found. Although soil moisture had a significant effect on separate nematode trophic groups and on most of the applied ecological indices, no differences in soil moisture were observed between slopes. Organic matter was found to have a significant effect on the fungivore nematodes. The obtained results indicate that the south-facing slope is more favorable for the observed free-living nematodes than the other sampling sites. Twenty-four of the 77 nematode species that were found in the observed area showed dependence on dune slope orientation. The fungibacteria ratio, Simpson's dominance index, and basal index were useful tools for determining slope differences.																			0440-6605	1336-9083				SEP	2010	47	3					179	188		10.2478/s11687-010-0027-6	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11687-010-0027-6													WOS:000282701500007

The highest leaf beetle diversity among the habitat types was in the forest areas with abundant shrubby understory at the KL with diversity values of 2.67 (Shannon-Wiener index) and 0.87 (Simpson index). The most similar habitats in terms of the leaf beetle communities were herbaceous open areas at both national parks with similarity values 50% (SOrensen index) and 34% (Jaccard index). Nonparametric estimators ICE, Chao2, Jackknife1 and Jackknife2 show that the percentages of the detected leaf beetle species during field surveys in the KL were between 85% and 93%, and in the KD were between 67% and 78%. Canonical correspondence analysis indicates that the most effective environmental variables on the leaf beetle species diversity were covers of the herbaceous and tree layers. Also, these results show that the most important environmental variable affecting the leaf beetle species diversity was floristic structure of the sites.					şen, ismail/AAY-1049-2021; GÖK, Ali/GZK-9272-2022	GÖK, Ali/0000-0003-2931-7151; sen, ismail/0000-0002-9905-3537													1738-2297	1748-5967				SEP	2014	44	5					176	190		10.1111/1748-5967.12064	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1748-5967.12064													WOS:000342815000002
J	Shetty, K; Gulimane, K				Shetty, Karunya; Gulimane, Krishnakumar			Application of microalgal diversity in assessing the water quality of freshwater ponds	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												The health of an ecosystem can be evaluated based on its ecological characteristics and intrinsic biological quality. Furthermore, as nutrients are easily accessible by the algal cells in an aquatic ecosystem, the biochemical composition of an algal cell also varies accordingly with the ecological condition of its habitat. This study was carried out to understand the impact of seasonal variation of physicochemical parameters on the microalgal diversity and composition of five freshwater ponds in Mangalore, India. The diversity indices, viz. Shannon's (0.88-3.42), Margalef's (0.16-3.6), and Simpson's dominance index (0.47-0.96), were analyzed using PAST. A prominent variation in both the abundance and diversity of species was observed during the study period. About 150 species of algae belonging to Cyanophyceae, Chlorophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Xanthophyceae, and Rhodophyceae were recorded. Of these groups, Chlorophyceae, specifically, desmids formed the dominant flora. Zygnematales were dominant during monsoon, while Chroococcales was the most dominant group during the post-monsoon season. Ecological conditions like temperature, pH, dissolved gases, and inorganic salts were found to impact the growth and abundance of microalgae. The ecological parameters showed a prominent effect on microalgal diversity. The results indicated that site SR was the least polluted and most diverse among the lentic habitats studied. It also had lesser noxious algal species which could be attributed to its nutrient composition.																			0167-6369	1573-2959				MAY	2023	195	5							595	10.1007/s10661-023-11116-w	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10661-023-11116-w								37079113					WOS:000984544000002

The impact of water quality deterioration on macroinvertebrate communities in the Swartkops River, South Africa: a multimetric approach	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AQUATIC SCIENCE												A multimetric approach, using 21 metrics representing five categories - abundance, composition, richness, diversity and biotic indices - was applied to investigate the impacts of water quality deterioration on macro invertebrate communities in the Swartkops River. Macroinvertebrates were sampled seasonally between August 2009 and July 2010 using the South African Scoring System version 5 (SASS5) protocol at one reference site upstream of Uitenhage and three downstream sites. Assessment of water quality impacts on macroinvertebrates was based on the discriminatory ability of metrics between the reference and impaired sites, and on their correlation with the physico-chemical variables. The metrics' discriminatory ability was explored using box plots, and their relationships with water chemistry variables elucidated with Pearson's correlation. Trichoptera abundance, % Chironomidae + Oligochaeta, % Ephemeroptera-Trichoptera-Odonata-Coleoptera (ETOC), % Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera-Plecoptera-Trichoptera (EPT) richness, ETOC richness, Margalef's family richness index, equitability, Shannon and Simpson diversity indices, SASS5 score and average score per taxon (ASPT) discriminated between the reference and impacted sites, and also exhibited significant correlations (p < 0.05) with water chemistry variables. Conversely, Gastropoda abundance, EPT abundance, ETOC abundance, EPT: Chironomidae ratio, % EPT, % Corixidae, % Oligochaeta + Hirudinae, Chironomidae + Oligochaeta abundance and Hemiptera + Diptera richness did not discriminate between the reference and impacted sites.

The results showed that between two watersheds showed that all of the contagion index, Shannon's diversity index, and patch cohesion index exhibited an ascending trend in the Dalihe watershed, and a descending trend in the Hailiutuhe watershed. In the Dalihe watershed, only Shannon's diversity index had a very significantly negative correlation with the runoff, whereas in the Hailiutuhe watershed, the contagion index had a significantly negative correlation with the runoff, and all of the Shannon's diversity index, the Shannon's evenness index, and the Simpson's evenness index had a significantly positive correlation with the runoff. In respect of correlation of sediment with landscape pattern, the sediment had a very significantly negative correlation only with Shannon's diversity index in the Dalihe watershed, whereas in the Hailiutuhe watershed, the sediment had a significantly negative correlation with all of the number of patches, the patch density, and the landscape shape index, and a very significantly positive correlation with the aggregation index. The importance of each landscape index in the regression equation and the positive or negative correlations indicated that erosion in watersheds could be reduced by strengthening the control function of the dominant patch, thoroughly improving the evenness of the landscape patch types, enriching the landscape types, reducing the physical connectivity between patches, and enhancing the degree of aggregation in landscape patches.

This clone was shown to have previously caused two outbreaks of respiratory disease and to possess a small extrachromosomal plasmid encoding ampicillin resistance. The study shows that describing the diversity within a bacterial population with SID may negate the need for retrospective subtyping comparisons.

Compared with even-aged plantations, the complex structure of uneven-aged forests complicates the formulation of management strategies. Forest structural diversity is expected to provide considerable significant information for uneven-aged forest management planning. In the present study, we investigated the potential of using SPOT-5 satellite images for extracting forest structural diversity. Forest stand variables were calculated from the field plots, whereas spectral and textural measures were derived from the corresponding satellite images. We firstly employed Pearson's correlation analysis to examine the relationship between the forest stand variables and the image-derived measures. Secondly, we performed all possible subsets multiple linear regression to produce models by including the image-derived measures, which showed significant correlations with the forest stand variables, used as independent variables. The produced models were evaluated with the adjusted coefficient of determination and the root mean square error (RMSE). Furthermore, a ten-fold cross-validation approach was used to validate the best-fitting models ( > 0.5). The results indicated that basal area, stand volume, the Shannon index, Simpson index, Pielou index, standard deviation of DBHs, diameter differentiation index and species intermingling index could be reliably predicted using the spectral or textural measures extracted from SPOT-5 satellite images.

Effects of invasive European frogbit and its two physical control methods on macroinvertebrates	FRESHWATER SCIENCE												European frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L.) is an invasive floating plant that negatively affects native plants in freshwater ecosystems. We conducted a field mesocosm experiment in Oneida Lake, New York (USA), to study the effect of frogbit cover on macroinvertebrates and to test the effects of 2 physical control methods, hand pulling and shading, on macroinvertebrate assemblages. We used Hester-Dendy samplers and Ekman grabs to collect surface/phytophilous and benthic macroinvertebrates. Metrics including density of different types of organisms, total abundance, taxon richness, and Simpson's diversity index were compared between control methods. Frogbit cover had significant positive effects on mollusk density, amphipod density, taxon richness, and Simpson's diversity in the Hester-Dendy surface samples. Sites with frogbit had significantly fewer benthic worms and more chironomids (Hester-Dendy bottom samples) and possibly higher diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates (Ekman samples). These data suggested that frogbit had positive effects on surface and phytophilous macroinvertebrates and may change population density and increase diversity of benthic macroinvertebrates. Hand pulling and shading did not affect macroinvertebrates except that amphipod density in surface water was significantly lower in shading sites. Therefore, from the perspective of minimizing effects on the macroinvertebrate communities in the lakes, hand pulling is preferable over shading for controlling frogbit.

Such parameters of soil property as pH value, soil bulk density, TKN, total C, C/N ratio, NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations in the seven forest ecosystems were determined. The results showed that the soil pH values, total C concentrations and the C/N ratios of the seven forest ecosystems did not differ from each other, while soil bulk density, TKN, NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations differed significantly, indicating that species composition significantly influenced the soil properties. The results of correlation showed that: 1. the two indices of tree layers were negatively correlated with soil bulk density; 2. the two indices of shrub layers were negatively correlated with soil NH4+-N concentration and 3. the two indices of herb layers were negatively correlated with soil NO3--N concentration, suggesting that soil bulk density decreased with the increase of species diversity of tree layers; and soil NH4+-N and NO3--N concentrations decreased with the increase of biodiversity of shrub layer and herb layer, respectively. Our results supported the hypothesis that species composition and species diversity in forest ecosystems would also have significant influences on soil properties, being similar to that of studies on grassland ecosystems.

Woodland fragmentation explains tree species diversity in an agricultural landscape of Southern Africa	TROPICAL ECOLOGY												Adopting theoretical frameworks that seek to understand biodiversity variations in agricultural landscapes is important for biodiversity-agriculture coexistence. In this study, we statistically tested whether the area-diversity relationship predicted by the island biogeography theory can successfully be used to explain differences in tree species diversity among different woodland patch sizes in Nyabamba resettlement area of south-eastern Zimbabwe. We used IKONOS imagery of 2009 to classify woodland, plantation and cropland areas, and GIS to calculate the woodland patch sizes. Tree species diversity was calculated from field data and then quantified using Simpson's (1-D) index. One Way ANOVA and Post Hoc analysis were used to test whether woodland patches of different sizes (less than 4 ha, between 4-25 ha and greater than 25 ha) had significant differences in mean tree species diversity. Our results show that larger patches had significantly (P < 0.05) higher mean species diversity than smaller woodland patches. The results indicate that the island biogeography theory can be used to explain tree species diversity differences in an agriculturally fragmented woodland.

These habitats play a prominent role in shaping vertical species distributions due to multiple correlations between elevation and a host of environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and anthropogenic disturbances. Thus, they make for a fascinating natural laboratory for biodiversity studies. Our study addresses the regional and elevational patterns of taxonomic and phylogenetic species diversity in the amphibians of Fujian Junzifeng National Nature Reserve located in eastern China. By combining various diversity indices, we provide a multi-dimensional framework to study the distribution mechanism of amphibian species diversity along a large elevational gradient, in the hopes of contributing to a greater understanding and effective conservation of mountainous amphibian diversity. Elevational gradients provide an excellent opportunity to assess biodiversity patterns and community structure. Previous studies mainly focus on higher elevations or are limited to small areas in mountainous regions. Little information can be found on amphibian biodiversity in middle- and low-elevational areas, hence our study was devoted to filling up the current gaps in these research areas. To understand the variability of biodiversity of amphibian species in the Fujian Junzifeng National Nature Reserve in eastern China, our study included taxonomic and phylogenetic components to describe the various patterns of regional and elevational distribution. The results showed that (1) most of the taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity metrics were correlated; with regard to the surveyed area, Faith's phylogenetic diversity index (PD) and net relatedness index (NRI) were positively correlated with the Shannon-Wiener index (H'), Margalef index (DMG), and species richness (S), while negatively with the Pielou index; whereas for elevation, only the Pielou index was positively correlated with the nearest taxon index (NTI), but negatively with other indices; (2) taxonomic and phylogenetic diversities did not differ among the three survey locations but differed significantly along the elevational gradient; Simpson index, H', S, and DMG had a hump-shaped relationship with elevations, and PD decreased gradually with the increase in elevation, whereas NRI and NTI sharply increased at the elevation above 900 m; (3) the species range size and the corresponding midpoint of amphibians were affected by a strong phylogenetic signal, which supports the elevational Rapoport's rule upon removal of Pachytriton brevipes and Boulenophrys sanmingensis from the study.

Benthic macroinvertebrate samples were collected from each of the 19 stations using the kick-net sampling method with a D-frame net (500-mu m mesh). Using the data from collected Trichoptera larvae, the similarity, diversity, dominance and population density relationships among habitats were measured. According to the calculated Shannon-Wiener and Simpson diversity index results, the station with the highest Trichoptera diversity was determined at S2, and the station with the least diversity was S14. Similar results were obtained for the calculated population density values. Station S2 was the most balanced station in population density. Thus, biodiversity was directly related to habitat structure, anthropogenic impact and geographical conditions, and environmental factors suppress biological species diversity. It was concluded that species diversity is greater in undestroyed habitats and less in heavily destroyed habitats. In addition, the species that dominate in biodiversity similarity rates prefer their habitat.																			0354-4664	1821-4339					2023	75	1					81	88		10.2298/ABS230119007O	http://dx.doi.org/10.2298/ABS230119007O													WOS:000996024900007

The main objective of this study was to assess the effects of coffee wastewater discharged to river water quality using physicochemical parameters and macro-invertebrate indices. This study was conducted from November to the end of December 2019. Ten wastewater and river water samples were taken from coffee the processing plant and river. The macro-invertebrate samples were collected by kick sampling technique using a standard hand net. Shannon and Simpson diversity indices were examined at 3 sampling stations. The Pielou evenness index was also determined. It was found that except for TDS all the parameters of the raw wastewater and river water did not comply with the international discharge limit. The mean concentration of Faro coffee processing plant wastewater were BOD5 (2409.6 +/- 173.1 mg/L). COD (4302 +/- 437 mg/L), TSS (2824.6 +/- 428.4 mg/L), TDS (3226 +/- 623.6 mg/L). and TS (4183.3 +/- 432.9 mg/L). Whereas from Bokaso coffee processing plant were BOD5 (3770 +/- 604.4 mg/L), COD (4082.6 +/- 921.9 mg/L), TSS (2766 1 +/- 501.7 mg/L), TDS (3017 +/- 747.6 mg/L), and TS (3874 +/- 471.1 mg/L). A total of 392 macroinvertebrates belonging to 24 families and 7 orders were collected. The benthos assemblage communities in this river were 40, 56, and 296 at downstream 1, downstream 2. and upstream respectively. The value of the Simpson diversity index varies from 0.4 to 0.75. In the same manner, the value of the Shannon diversity index also varied from 0.5 to 1.36. Most of the physicochemical parameters of the raw wastewater were beyond the national and international discharge limits. The quality of Orsha river water downstream was more adversely affected compared to upstream.

Ajmal			The distribution and diversity of culturable aerobic heterotrophic benthic bacteria in the continental slope of the Bay of Bengal: Linked abiotic factors, including a tsunami	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF MARINE BIOLOGY												The culturable aerobic heterotrophic benthic bacterial population and community structure in relation to the physico-chemical parameters in the continental slope of the Bay of Bengal was studied. In addition, diversity indices were calculated and pretsunami (in 2004) and post-tsunami (in 2005) diversity values were compared. Sediment samples were collected from two cruises in the depth zone of 214-1000 m (10A degrees 36' N-20A degrees 01' N and 79A degrees 59' E-87A degrees 30' E). The vertical distribution of the total heterotrophic bacterial population during both cruises was higher in the top section (0-3 cm) of the sediment. The average total heterotrophic bacterial population was in the range of 0.42-37.38 x 10(4) CFU/g to 1.66-19.73 x 10(4) CFU/g dry sediment weight during the two cruises, respectively. The limiting physico-chemical factors were sediment pH, sediment temperature, TOC, porosity, and clay as revealed from multiple regression (r = 0.75) and BIOENV (Partial Correlation rho omega = 0.447) analyses. The shannon-Wiener index (H' log e), Simpson index (D), Margalef index (d) and Pielou's evenness index (J') were found to be higher in the 1000 m depth stations. Cluster analysis showed that the 500 m depth stations clustered either with the 200 m or with the 1000 m stations. The 200 m depth stations never formed a cluster with the 1000 m stations. Pre-tsunami diversity indices at two depth ranges (200 m and 1000 m) were higher than those of the post-tsunami indices, which was quite evident from the cluster analysis as well. This study confirms the effect of the tsunami surge in the sediments of the continental slope of the Bay of Bengal in the marine ecosystem, which is also attributed to the temporal variation of the heterotrophic bacterial population and diversity.

Exploring the effect of different gap sizes on the soil bacterial community structure of weeping cypress plantations can provide a theoretical basis for the near-natural management of forest plantations. We, therefore, constructed three kinds of forest gaps with different sizes in weeping cypress plantations, namely, small (50-100 m(2)), medium (100-200 m(2)), and large gaps (400-667 m(2)), for identifying the key factors that affect soil bacterial communities following the construction of forest gaps. The results suggested that the herb layer was more sensitive than the shrub layer, while the Simpson, Shannon, and richness indices of the herb layer in plots with gaps were significantly higher than those of designated sampling plots without any gaps (CK). The presence of large gaps significantly increased the understory plant diversity and the Shannon and Simpson indices of the soil bacterial alpha diversity. There were obvious changes in the community composition of soil bacteria following the construction of forest gaps. The dominant bacterial phyla, orders, and functions were similar across the plots with different gap sizes. Of the indicator bacterial species, the abundance of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria, Lysobacter_ yangpyeongensis, and Ensifer_meliloti, was significantly different across plots with different gap sizes and accounted for a large proportion of the bacterial population of plots with medium and large gaps. The understory plant diversity was mostly related to the soil bacterial community than to other soil factors. The results of structural equation modeling indicated that the understory plant diversity was the most important environmental factor in driving the composition and diversity of bacterial communities. The construction of forest gaps significantly improved the understory plant diversity, physicochemical properties of the soil, and bacterial diversity in weeping cypress plantations, and the results of the comprehensive evaluation were in the order: large gaps > small gaps > medium gaps > CK. Our results suggested that large gaps are beneficial for the diversity of above-ground plant communities and underground soil bacterial communities.

The purpose of this study was to compare the tree diversity before and after the application of silvicultural treatments in a temperate forest in northern Mexico. Fifteen experimental plots, each measuring 2500 m(2), were established to evaluate the immediate effect of four silvicultural treatments. These treatments were identified by their levels of management: intensive (clearcut, removal 100%), semi-intensive (removal of 59-61% of basal area), conservative (removal of 29-31% of basal area), and a control group. New forest guidelines, in contrast to conventional approaches, were applied to the semi-intensive and conservative treatments based on health and diversity conditions. Basal area, canopy cover, tree and total volume were measured in each plot. The Importance Value Index, alpha diversity, and evenness were estimated before and after treatments. Eighteen species belonging to five genera and five families were found in the study area. The species with the highest ecological values were Pinus durangensis, P. teocote, Quercus sideroxyla, and Quercus convallata with IVI numbers between 13.6 and 24.5%. Alpha diversity was intermediate (Margalef: 2.9 to 3.8), while dominance and evenness were above average compared to other studies (Simpson: 0.69 to 0.77; Shannon-Wiener: 1.44 to 1.6; Pielou: 0.76 to 0.85). The species evenness index in the conservative treatment was high (Sorensen, Jaccard, quantitative Sorensen and Morisita-Horn; 88 to 99%), although abundance decreased. Overall, there were no significant differences in IVI values and diversity indicators before and after treatments, with the exception of the clearcut treatment. When associating the diversity indices with stand variables, only the Pielou's evenness index showed a significant relationship between them. We concluded that both the conservative and semi-intensive treatments did not generate significant changes in tree diversity, but the former had slightly higher alpha diversity indices. These results can provide a better insight on silvicultural practices and their effects on species composition.

The main aim of the present research was to study soil microbial and free-living nematode abundance and diversity on different soil rock formations (basalt, sandstone, limestone, granite and gypsum) of the Makhtesh Ramon erosional cirque. The obtained results showed the strong effect of soil features of different soil formations on microbial biomass and respiration as well as on the soil free-living nematode communities and its trophic and species composition. The Sorenson-Czenkanowski similarity index indicated significant differences between soil properties as well as between soil biota in observed soil formations. The qCO(2), which is known to increase according to the level of environmental stress, reached maximal values in the sandstone soil formation. The values of ecological indices such as Simpson's dominance index, maturity index and modification and species richness pointed to a specific ecological condition in the studied soil formations dependent on low content of an essential soil matter as soil moisture, organic matter and cations.

J	Onyia, NN; Balzter, H; Berrio, JC				Onyia, Nkeiruka Nneti; Balzter, Heiko; Berrio, Juan Carlos			Spectral Diversity Metrics for Detecting Oil Pollution Effects on Biodiversity in the Niger Delta	REMOTE SENSING												Biodiversity monitoring in the Niger delta has become pertinent in view of the incessant spillages from oil production activities and the socio-economic impact of these spillages on the inhabitants who depend on the resources for their livelihood. Conventional methods of post-impact assessments are expensive, time consuming, and cause damage to the environment, as they often require the removal of affected samples/specimens for laboratory analysis. Remote sensing offers the opportunity to track biodiversity changes from space while using the spectral variability hypothesis (SVH). The SVH proposes that the species diversity of a sampled area is linearly correlated with the variability of spectral reflectance of the area. Several authors have tested the SVH on various land cover types and spatial scales; however, the present study evaluated the validity of the SVH against the backdrop of oil pollution impact on biodiversity while using vascular plant species as surrogates. Species richness and diversity indices were computed from vegetation data collected from polluted and non-polluted transects. Spectral metrics that were derived from Sentinel 2 bands and broadband vegetation indices (BVIs) using various algorithms, including averages, spread, dimension reduction, and so on, were assessed for their ability to estimate vascular plants species richness and diversity. The results showed significant differences in vegetation characteristics of polluted and control transects (H = 76.05, p-value = <0.05 for abundance and H = 170.03, p-value < 0.05 for richness). Spectral diversity metrics correlated negatively with species data on polluted transects and positively on control transects. The metrics computed using Sentinel 2A bands and vegetation indices proved to be sensitive to changes in vegetation characteristics following oil pollution. The most robust relationship was observed between the metrics and indices on control transects, whereas the weakest relationships were observed on polluted transects. Index-wise, the Simpson's diversity index regressed better with spectral metrics (R-2 > 0.5), whereas the Chao-1 richness index regressed the least (R-2 < 0.5). The strength of the relationship resulted in successfully estimating species richness and diversity values of investigated transects, thereby enhancing biodiversity monitoring over time and space.

Several macrophyte diversity indices were analysed (species richness-N, the Shannon index-H', the Simpson index-D, and the Pielou index-J) as well as the ecological status index (the Macrophyte Index for Rivers-MIR). The aim of the study was to verify knowledge about potential application of macrophytes in the environmental monitoring. A Multi-Layer Perceptron type of network was used in the analyses. The study included 260 river sites located throughout Poland. Alkalinity, conductivity, pH, nitrate and ammonium nitrogen, reactive and total phosphorus, and biochemical oxygen demand were used as the explanatory variables. The quality of the constructed models was assessed using calculated errors (RMSE and NRMSE) and r Pearson's linear correlation coefficient. The neural network for the MIR index was characterised by the highest quality. Neural networks for other diversity indices (N, H', D, and J) did not provide adequate results for modelling, which shows their ineffectiveness biological monitoring. Sensitivity analysis revealed the influence of each variable to the models. It indicated that modelled values of MIR are most strongly influenced by total phosphorus and alkalinity.

Statistical data showed that the number of trammel net in Langsa in 2013 was 84 units and the number increased to 152 units in 2016. The main target of trammel net is shrimp. Whereas in reality the most catches are fish, with different species, small sizes of fish and not sellable. The objective of the present study was to assess the enviromental friendliness level of trammel net to the environment. Data collection was carried out by experimental fishing, with 3 samples of purse seine ships and 3 catching trips each. The data collected were number of fishes, species and size of the length and weight of the fishes. Data were analyzed using Shannon diversity index, Simpson dominance index, and scoring analysis (based on the 9 criteria of CCRF (Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries) about the environmental friendliness level of fishing gear). The results showed that the catch species diversity index was average 0.80 (high diversity index; low fishing gear selectivity) and average of dominance index was 0.27 categorized as low dominance (no dominance of certain species). The total score of the enviromental friendliness level was 27 which means trammel net categorized as less friendly to the environment.					miswar, edy/AAD-7899-2021	miswar, edy/0000-0002-3919-4047													1755-1307						2018	216								012007	10.1088/1755-1315/216/1/012007	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/216/1/012007													WOS:000467856700007
J	Hou, MH; Qing, P; Min, S				Hou, Minghui; Qing, Ping; Min, Shi			Multiple indicators of household dietary diversity in rural China: Effects of income and dietary knowledge	NUTRITION												Objective:The aim of this study was to examine the association among family income, dietary knowledge, their interaction, and the multiple household dietary diversity indices (HDDIs), including dietary diversity score (DDS), entropy index (EI), Shannon equitability index (SEI), Herfindahl index (HI), and Simpson index (SI). Methods: Based on 24-h dietary recall data collected from 1076 rural households in three provinces of Central China, we calculated HDDIs and compared them according to different levels of income and dietary knowledge. A set of multivariate linear regression were further established and estimated to examine the association among family income, dietary knowledge, and household dietary diversity. Results: Although the calculation formulas are different, the distributions of the five diversity indices, namely, DDS, EI, SEI, HI, and SI are similar. Family income and dietary knowledge were significantly and positively correlated with various HDDIs (P < 0.01) in addition to HI. Specifically, with a 1-unit (10 000 yuan [US $1545]) income increase, the DDIs respectively changed by 1.70% (DDS), 1.23% (EI), 0.92% (SEI),-0.62% (HI, reverse), and 0.45% (SI). With a 1-point dietary knowledge score increase, the DDIs changed by 0.91% (DDS), 1.33% (EI), 1.29% (SEI),-1.19% (HI, reverse), and 0.81% (SI). The interaction effect of income and dietary knowledge on HDDIs were significantly and negatively correlated with various HDDIs (P < 0.05) in addition to HI. Conclusions: The present findings indicated that with an increase in income and dietary knowledge, rural residents in China would consume more diversified foods. There was a substitution effect of family income and dietary knowledge on HDDIs; that is, with an increase in family income, the effect of dietary knowledge on HDDIs would decrease. The findings of this study contributed to a better understanding of issues related to the dietary diversity of rural residents in China in the context of rising income and residents' increasing dietary knowledge.

Methods: A study area was selected in a traditionally managed mountain woody pasture during July 2012 to June 2013. The area was sampled by quadrat method. The quadrats were laid down at regular intervals of 150 m. The size of quadrats was kept 10x10, 5X5 and 1x1 m(2) for trees, shrubs and herbs respectively. Density, frequency and cover were recorded. Importance value index of each plant species was calculated and plant communities were named after the plant species having the highest IV. Then diversity, its components and regenerating capacity were calculated with their formulas. Results: Shannon's diversity ranged from 2.75 to 3.31, Simpson's diversity, 0.90 to 0.95; Menhinick's diversity, 0.83 to 1.19; evenness, 0.41 to 0.65; species richness, 4.89 to 6.08 and maturity index, 30 to 44 species distribution pattern. Diversity values were similar to the other Himalayan forests. Pinus roxburghaii was the only regenerating species whereas the remaining four tree species including Qurecus dilatata regenerate up to 100 cm; they are at extreme risk of elimination due to anthropogenic factors. Conclusions: Nikyal valley is under severe deforestation pressure for fuel and timber value. There is an urgent need to promote the ethics among the people that improvement and conservation of natural resources are critical for land and soil management.

A study was conducted to identify the floral resources used by M. beecheii using honey samples collected in four regions of the state of Campeche, Mexico. A melissopalynological analysis of sixteen collected honey samples identified 69 plant species from 24 families, and established that Fabaceae was the main plant family visited. Based on botanical origin, seven samples were classified as monofloral and nine as multifloral. The predominant species were Bursera simaruba, Lonchocarpus longistylus, Piscidia piscipula, Senna pallida and Senna racemosa. Shannon diversity index values (2.06-2.55) indicated moderate diversity in floral resources and Simpson diversity index values (0.82-0.89) indicated a moderate dominance of plant species in the studied regions. The results suggest M. beecheii is polylectic with some degree of specialization. The plant species identified as predominant in the studied honey samples are candidates for use in strategies intended to conserve the food resources used by M. beecheii on the Yucatan Peninsula.

An undulating topography and freckly soil properties cause ups and downs in tree diversity, composition and distribution. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of Gobind Sagar reservoir on soil properties relative to the distance from it and asess its effect on tree diversity, evenness and their distribution in tropical and subtropical forests. Based on data analysis it was found that the soil moisture and organic carbon decreased along with increasing distance from the reservoir. It played a significant role in varying tree diversity. The sites distributed within 0-2 km showed significantly higher a and beta-diversity indices. Tree species richness and diversity indices showed a strong correlation (p < 0.05) with soil moisture and organic carbon content. Simpson's and McIntosh evenness indices showed a strong negative correlation with soil bulk density. Indirect Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) identified soil moisture and soil organic carbon as two major environmental gradients that influenced tree diversity and their distribution in five tropical and four subtropical forests in an upstream catchment of the reservoir. Mixed forests inhabited moist sites and Acacia-Pinus forests showed an inclination to dry areas. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed that the tree species in tropical forests were mainly affected by driving forces such as soil moisture, organic carbon and bulk density whereas, in subtropical forest tree species were influenced by elevation, soil pH, EC and clay content.

Floristic composition, structure and diversity of riparian forests in southwestern Nigeria: conservation is inevitable	NORDIC JOURNAL OF BOTANY												The Nigerian riparian forest ecosystems had declined in extent and distribution and this had been attributed mainly to land use change. This study intended to provide understanding links between plant diversity, composition, structures and disturbances both anthropogenic and natural processes inducing the vegetation dynamics. Nine study sites were used for this study, within each site, five (5) plots (0.25 ha in size) were marked out, placed systematically at an interval of 10 m along transect. Complete enumeration of plants species was carried out and identified to species level. Diversity indices and structural parameters were determined and anthropogenic activities were ranked. A total number of 233 plant species were identified, belonging to 80 families; out of which, Euphorbiaceae and Apocynaceae were dominant families. The density and basal area ranged from 2200 to 6000 ha(-1) and 2.59 to 17.58 m(2) ha(-1) respectively across the study sites. Pterocarpus santalinoides, Alchornea cordiflora, Chassalia kolly, Tetracera spp., Fimbristylis, Bambusa vulgaris and Cyrtosperma senegalense were the dominant species. The Shannon diversity index ranged from (1.38-3.49), Simpson (0.66-0.97) and Evenness diversity was (0.43-0.84). Fisher alpha (10.03-30.21) and Whittaker beta diversity (0.36-0.89) values were highest in Ipetumodu (site VIII) and lowest in Ilesha (site II). Seventy-three (73%) of the species in this study had low important value index (IVI). The dominance of some lianas and herbaceous species in the riparian forest sites showed disturbances, stages of ecological succession and regeneration of the vegetation.

Methods Seawater samples and physicochemical factors were collected from the coastal zone of Changle city on 8 September 2019. Nineteen filter membranes were obtained after using a suction filtration system. We randomly selected eight samples for total seawater bacteria (SWDNA group) sequencing and three samples for active seawater bacteria (SWRNA group) sequencing by Illumina MiSeq. The remaining eight samples were used for bacterial culture and identification. Alpha diversity including species coverage (Coverage), species diversity (Shannon-Wiener and Simpson index), richness estimators (Chao1), and abundance-based richness estimation (ACE) were calculated to assess biodiversity of seawater bacterioplankton. Beta diversity was used to evaluate the differences between samples. The species abundance differences were determined using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Statistical analyses were performed in R environment. Results The Alpha diversity in the SWDNA group in each index was ACE 3206.99, Chao1 2615.12, Shannon 4.64, Simpson 0.05, and coverage 0.97; the corresponding index was ACE 1199.55, Chao1 934.75, Shannon 3.49, Simpson 0.09, and coverage 0.99. The sequencing results of seawater bacterial genes in the coastal waters of Changle city showed that the phyla of high-abundance bacteria of both the SWDNA and SWRNA groups included Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The main classes included Oxyphotobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria. The main genera included Synechococcus CC9902, Chloroplast, and Cyanobium_PCC-6307. Beta diversity analysis showed a significant difference between the SWDNA and SWRNA groups (P < 0.05). The species abundance differences between SWDNA and SWRNA groups after Wilcoxon rank-sum test showed that, at the phylum level, Actinomycetes was more abundant in SWDNA group (9.17 vs 1.02%, P < 0.05); at the class level, Actinomycetes (delta- Proteus) was more abundant in SWDNA group (9.47% vs 1.01%, P < 0.05); and at the genus level, Chloroplast was more abundant in SWRNA group (13.07% vs 44.57%, P < 0.05). Nine species and 53 colonies were found by bacterial culture: 20 strains of Vibrio (37.74%), 22 strains of Enterobacter (41.51%), and 11 strains of non-fermentative bacteria (20.75%). Conclusion Illumi MiSeq sequencing of seawater bacteria revealed that the total bacterial community groups and the active bacterial community groups mainly comprised Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroides at the phylum level; Oxyphotobacteria, alpha-Proteobacteria, and gamma-Proteobacteria at the class level; with Synechococcus_CC9902, Chloroplast, and Cyanobium_PCC-6307 comprising the predominant genera. Exploring the composition and differences of seawater bacteria assists understanding regarding the biodiversity and the infections related to seawater bacteria along the coast of the Changle, provides information that will aid in the diagnosis and treatment of such infections.

Therefore, we assessed the composition, diversity, and conservation status of woody plant species of the Debre Libanos church forests and surrounding forest lands in Oromiya Regional National State, central Ethiopia in 62 nested circular sample plots spaced 200 m apart along two transect lines. Large circular plots 314 m(2) were used to sample trees with DBH of at least 10 cm, and subplots of 28.26 m(2) were laid in each main plot were used to assess saplings and shrubs; a small subplot of 3.14 m(2) was used to assess seedlings. In total, 70 woody plant species belonging to 62 genera and 43 families were recorded. Of these, 59, 28 and 32 were in the church, government and private forest types, respectively. The most dominant families were Fabaceae and Verbenaceae, each represented by five species. In the forests considered, trees accounted for 61%, and shrubs with diameter at breast height (DBH) of 1-10 cm accounted for ca. 33%. Among growth forms of woody species, shrubs and seedlings, followed by trees constituted much of the density of woody species in all the three ownership types of forests. The church forest had the most species (59) and highest Shannon (3.12) and Simpson (0.92) species diversity indices, and the government and private forests had a nearly similar total number of species and Shannon and Simpson species diversity indices. Most of the species with higher importance value indices (IVI) were indigenous in origin within the church forest (Juniperus procera = 82), government forest (J. procera = 66) and private forest (Acacia abyssinica = 84). The composition, diversity, and population structure of woody species in the church forest were significantly higher than in the other forest lands. However, interventions of the government and private sectors to conserve forest systems in the areas, particularly the government-owned forest and specific species such as Olea europaea need active enrichment plantings due to their limited natural regeneration. Without improved management interventions, livelihood income diversification and ecosystem services obtained from the forest will not be sustainable.

Keeping track of biodiversity indices and their evolution over time is a useful procedure for preserving biodiversity within urban habitats. The paper presents an application of the R programming language and the R package "vegan" for calculating alpha and beta diversity indices for dendroflora in urban parks. The case study includes five major parks in the city of Novi Sad, Serbia: Danube, Futog, Kamenica, Liman and Railway park. The alpha indices calculated in the paper are the richness, Simpson, Shannon, Berger-Parker and Fisher indices, and they have been used to quantify the diversity of dendroflora in each park separately. The beta indices in this research were the Jaccard distance and Sorensen indices, and these have been used to estimate the overlap in dendrofloristic composition among parks. These analyses have been supported with additional analysis related to the dendrofloristic elements such as the ratio of native to non-native species of trees and shrubs, family spectrum, analysis of prevailing native species, abundance of invasive species, etc. This research has shown that the Danube, Futog and Kamenica parks are highly valuable from a biodiversity perspective, but also that there are distinct differences in plant composition among the five parks. This research demonstrates application of the R program in measuring dendrofloristic diversity, and creating comprehensive databases of floristic elements in urban parks. Beyond its utility for calculation purposes and processing of numerical data related to individual plant species, R can be used for the analysis of spatial data and creating maps, making its scientific applications to ecological problems even more attractive.

Effects of seining effort on estimates of fish diversity in a sand-bed river	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Changes in species diversity can be an indicator of ecosystem disturbance, impairment, or recovery. Estimating sampling effort needed to adequately represent stream fish assemblages is necessary for informing conservation actions. Increased sampling intensity can increase species detection, affecting the accuracy and precision of biodiversity indices. Seining is commonly used in fish surveys in sand-bottomed streams of the western USA. Here, we sampled 20, 200-m long stream sites each with 40 consecutive seine hauls to determine how increased within-site effort affected measures of species diversity. An average of 10 seine hauls were required to collect 75% of species present at sites in 40 seine hauls, while 18 seine hauls were required to collect 100% of species observed at a site sampled with 40 hauls. Simpson's diversity index was highly variable when fewer than 7 seine hauls were performed at each site but stabilized when effort was > 15 seine hauls per site. Total dissimilarity and beta-diversity components were variable under low sampling effort and also stabilized when effort reached 15 seine hauls per site. However, sampling with more than 18-20 seine hauls per site yielded few additional species. In shallow, sand-bed streams, we suggest sampling with < 5 seine hauls per 200 m of stream can result in unreliable estimates of alpha-diversity and variation in beta-diversity. Increased effort of 15-20 seine hauls per 200 m of stream captured nearly all species present in 40 hauls per 200 m and stabilized species evenness and beta-diversity indices.

Soil samples were taken from a field experiment which was conducted for three years to characterize the agronomic characteristics of eight cover crops: Crotalaria juncea L., Crotalaria spectabilis Roth, Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don., Canavalia ensiformis (L.) DC., Mucuna pruriens (L.) DC., Dolichos lablab L., Neonotonia wightii (Wight & Arn.) J.A. Lackey, and Brachiaria decumbens Stapf. cv. Basilisk. The highest values of diversity in the macroarthropod community were found on the plot where M. pruriens was cultivated. Brachiaria decumbens cultivation showed lower values of species richness, Shannon's diversity index and Simpson's dominance index compared to the other studied plant species. Our findings suggest that the cultivation of legume cover crops can change positively the macroarthropod community composition. The results highlight the importance of considering the effects of legumes on the diversity of this biological component and their effect on plant growth and soil organic carbon contents. Thus, legumes may exploit positive feedback in semiarid conditions on a Regosol.					de Souza, Tancredo Augusto Feitosa/I-3314-2019; Santos, Djail/P-9035-2014	de Souza, Tancredo Augusto Feitosa/0000-0001-8729-5478; Santos, Djail/0000-0003-2207-3115													0006-3088	1336-9563				DEC	2019	74	12					1653	1660		10.2478/s11756-019-00272-5	http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/s11756-019-00272-5													WOS:000495115900008

In total, 1,352 ground beetles were collected, belonging to 16 genera and 44 species. Of these, four dominant species Dolichus halensis, Harpalus pastor, Carabus casaleianus, and Pheropsophus jessoensis were identified, respectively, comprising 370, 177, 131, and 123 individuals. The deciduous forest showed greater diversity (3.78 according to Shannon-Weiner index), equitability (0.80 according to Pielou's index), and dominance (9.52 according to Simpson's index) when compared with farmland, but species richness in the deciduous forest (27) was lower than that in farmland (35). One-way analysis of variance showed that ground beetle species composition and abundance among different habitats varied significantly. Cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis showed that farmland shared low community similarity with other habitat types, and coniferous and mixed coniferous forests shared similar community types. Our results indicate that species composition, abundance, and diversity of ground beetles are affected by different habitat types, with deciduous forest types being critical in maintaining the diversity of rare species. We recommend reducing cultivated farmland area and increasing the area of carefully planned deciduous forest in order to better protect ground beetle diversity in the region.

Modelling the ecological impact of invasive weed <i>Verbesina encelioides</i> on vegetation composition across dryland ecosystems of Punjab, northwestern India	ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT												Events of climate change have led to increased aridification, which alters local vegetation patterns and results in the invasion of opportunistic species. Though many studies assess the impact of invasive weeds and aridification at the agronomic level, studies investigating changes in local vegetation are severely lacking. We investigated the impact of the invasive plant Verbesina encelioides (Asteraceae) on the local vegetation composition across different dryland ecosystems in Punjab, northwestern India. Based on the aridity index for the period of 1991-2016, three major dryland ecosystems, i.e., arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid, were found in Punjab. The impact of V. encelioides on local biodiversity was measured in terms of species diversity (using Shannon's diversity index, Simpson's dominance index, Hill's evenness index, and Margalef's richness index), species composition (using non-metric multidimensional scaling based on Bray-Curtis's dissimilarity index), and species proportion in the two invasion classes (uninvaded and invaded) and across the three aridity zones (arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid). The vegetation survey depicted the presence of 53 flowering species belonging to 22 families, including 30 exotics and 23 natives. Verbesina encelioides decreased species diversity and proportion, with a more pronounced impact in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. In contrast, species composition varied between uninvaded and invaded classes only in arid ecosystems. Ecological parameters derived from population statistics (number of individuals) were more drastically affected than those from species abundance data. Since the ecological impacts of V. encelioides were manifested with increased aridification, it is a matter of apprehension under the potential climate change scenario.

Massively parallel rRNA gene sequencing exacerbates the potential for biased community diversity comparisons due to variable library sizes	ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY												Technologies for massively parallel sequencing are revolutionizing microbial ecology and are vastly increasing the scale of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene studies. Although pyrosequencing has increased the breadth and depth of possible rRNA gene sampling, one drawback is that the number of reads obtained per sample is difficult to control. Pyrosequencing libraries typically vary widely in the number of sequences per sample, even within individual studies, and there is a need to revisit the behaviour of richness estimators and diversity indices with variable gene sequence library sizes. Multiple reports and review papers have demonstrated the bias in non-parametric richness estimators (e. g. Chao1 and ACE) and diversity indices when using clone libraries. However, we found that biased community comparisons are accumulating in the literature. Here we demonstrate the effects of sample size on Chao1, ACE, CatchAll, Shannon, Chao-Shen and Simpson's estimations specifically using pyrosequencing libraries. The need to equalize the number of reads being compared across libraries is reiterated, and investigators are directed towards available tools for making unbiased diversity comparisons.

Moreover, the study attempted to estimate the extent of the survey (sampling effort) needed for detection of full plant diversity in river ecosystems. The analysed data were collected in a botanical survey carried out on the lowland sandy bottom Wel river, which is a very common river type in Europe. The Chao method of estimation of total species richness of macrophytes and Hill numbers were used to estimate the diversity based on very common plants (inverse Simpson index) as well as frequent species (Shannon index) and also including rare species (species richness). The analysis showed that using standard macrophyte survey approach for rivers, it is relatively easy to record abundant plants, but it is not possible to detect all species, because many aquatic macrophytes occur with low frequency and abundance requiring enormous sampling effort to detect all of them. It exceeds capabilities of most scientific projects. To improve the accuracy of diversity estimation, the rarefaction and extrapolation method was recommended. This method can reduce the bias in diversity estimates based on limited observational data, and thus limit inaccurate conclusions and subsequent wrong decisions in the conservation frameworks related to freshwater protection.

The most productive lake was Balik lake, while the lowest productive lake is Liman lake in the study area. Secondary strategies were found to be dominant in studied lakes. No species exhibit pure S-strategy in the present study. pH, electrical conductivity, P and NH4 concentrations were found to be significant. However, total of nitrite-N and nitrate-N concentrations were not significant. EC and pH were associated with the species in Liman and Cernek lakes, respectively. However, P and NH4 concentrations were associated with the species in Balik lake according to canonical correspondence analysis. Significant correlations were found among chemical traits and biological diversity. pH was positively correlated with Shannon-Wiener index, while negatively correlated with Simpson and Berger-Parker indexes. No significant correlations were found between water P concentrations and evenness.

Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (FAFLP) analysis was performed on 31 Salmonella Enteritidis strains from South Brazil isolated from human, foods, swine, broiler carcasses, and other poultry-related samples to subtype isolates in comparison to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. Five strains of Salmonella Enteritidis from different geographical regions, Salmonella Enteritidis ATCC 13076, and four isolates of different Salmonella serovars were also tested. Among the 41 isolates tested, 96 polymorphic AFs and 40 distinct profiles were obtained, displaying a Simpson's index of diversity of 0.99; whereas the PFGE analysis presented 13 patterns and the resulting Simpson's index was 0.55. Nine FAFLP and seven PFGE clusters could be inferred based in Dice similarity coefficient. FAFLP clustering readily identified different serotypes of Salmonella but did not distinguish isolates epidemiologically nonrelated or distinct phage types. Therefore, these results indicate that FAFLP is a rapid method for epidemiological investigations of Salmonella outbreaks, presenting a high discriminatory power for subtyping of Salmonella Enteritidis.

Research was undertaken in a village in south-west Burkina Faso to investigate the relationship between species composition, diversity, density, species accumulation and land use category. Additionally the relationship between number of trees, size of farmed land and farmer ethnicity was investigated. Indigenous Tiefo farmers had on average more than double the number of large (> 4 m) trees of Vitellaria paradoxa Gaertn. f., Parkia biglobosa (Jacq.) R. Br. Ex G. Don and Anacardium occidentale L. than farmers belonging to other ethnic groups, but this was partly explained by a larger area being available. Differences between ethnic groups were not significant when expressed per ha. Botanical inventories of fallows more than 4 years old, cultivated parklands and plantations of Mangifera indica L. and A. occidentale showed that tree density and Simpson's index of diversity for trees were highest in the fallow. Simpson's index was not significantly different for regeneration, but sample-based species accumulation curves indicated that species accumulation in parklands was faster than in plantations when expressed per individual. The average regeneration density was 12,605, 1,995 and 6,772 seedlings ha(-1) for fallow, parklands and plantations, respectively. This low density for parklands means that species accumulation is slow compared to the other land uses when expressed per unit area. Fallow seems the most efficient way of keeping tree diversity in the agricultural landscape.

Shannon-Wiener and Simpson diversity indices were calculated for the sampling station separately. Sorenson' coefficient was calculated to assess the similarity between the sampling areas. The results showed that there were a great variety Chironomidae in Lar River composed of two sub-families and 6 different genus; Chironominae (Chironomus, Stictochironomus, Polypedilum, Endochironomus, Hyporhygma) and Tanypodinae (Brundiniella) which 2 of them are recorded for the first time for Iranian fauna. Among the collected genera, Polypedilum was the most abundant genus especially in Lar station rather than Polour. According to the diversity indices, genera diversity in Polour station was higher than Lar.

M.			<i>Cuphea hyssopifolia</i> Kunth: A Potential Plant for Conserving Insect Pollinators in Shivalik Foot Hills of Himalaya	NATIONAL ACADEMY SCIENCE LETTERS-INDIA												Cuphea hyssopifolia Kunth, a tropical evergreen hardy shrub, was studied in foot hills of Shivalik range of Himalaya. This study revealed that a total of 30 insect species belonging to orders Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera visited this plant, with Simpson's diversity index (SDI) of 0.94. The Shannon-Wiener index (H') was 1.25 (morning), 1.28 (afternoon) and 1.31 (evening) showing upmost diversity with high abundance of pollinators for foraging on this plant whole day and also visitor species were evenly distributed. Peak foraging activity of visitors was found during afternoon (12.00-1.00 pm) with Apis mellifera, A. cerana and A. florea bees more interactive species. The weather parameters had a low and non-significant impact on insect visitation. This plant produces both pollen and nectar with profuse flowering to attract and sustain foraging activity. Thus, this plant can be recommended for conserving and augmenting the insect pollinators for enhancing pollination support in farming landscapes.																			0250-541X	2250-1754				2023 APR	2023	46	2					137	142		10.1007/s40009-023-01217-y	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40009-023-01217-y		JAN 2023											WOS:000922537000001
J	Attrill, MJ; Stafford, R; Rowden, AA				Attrill, MJ; Stafford, R; Rowden, AA			Latitudinal diversity patterns in estuarine tidal flats: indications of a global cline	ECOGRAPHY												Latitudinal diversity gradients are a general feature of the terrestrial realm. Fewer studies have addressed marine habitats and those concerning soft sediments: have not reported such consistent trends. This study investigates global patterns of macroinvertebrate alpha -diversity in estuarine tidal flats. A literature search was as conducted to collect data on species diversity as well as various physical, chemical and biological factors that may prove useful in investigating the cause of trends. Regression analysis revealed a significant association between latitude and diversity expressed as Simpson's index of concentration (r(2) = 0.44), the index being lower (i.e. diversity higher) at low latitudes. There was no significant association between diversity and either available estuary area or annual rainfall. A significant, although weak. relationship between diversity and mean annual temperature was apparent (r(2) = 0.23). together with an increase in species to family ratio in the hottest areas. This could suggest greater evolutionary speed in thr tropics (due to temperature increasing mutation rates and generation times) and may provide an explanation for the trend. However, a greater amount of variation is explained by latitude alone and it is suggested that a primary cause of the latitudinal dine in estuarine diversity may be the greater effective evolutionary time available fur communities in the tropics, temperate estuaries bring regularly disturbed by glaciation during the last 1.8 million years.

J	Végh, L; Tsuyuzaki, S				Vegh, Lea; Tsuyuzaki, Shiro			Remote sensing of forest diversities: the effect of image resolution and spectral plot extent	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING												Detecting field diversities via remote sensing is becoming important to monitor vegetation dynamics at large scale. The characteristics of the remotely sensed image, depending on the study organism and habitat, affect the efficiency of measuring alpha-and beta-diversities. Therefore, we examined the impact of image resolutions and spectral plot extents on the accuracy of estimating forest alpha-diversities and compositional variances on the active volcano Mount Usu, northern Japan. Low- (3.2 m) and high-resolution (0.8 m) IKONOS multispectral images were used to create spectral indicators from pixels covering the field plots (narrow extent) and from pixels including neighbouring area (wide extent). Six forest diversity indices were obtained for canopy and for canopy-herb layer (total diversity): species richness (S), Shannon (H'), evenness (J'), Gini-Simpson (D), and true diversity of order 1 (N (1) = expH') and order 2 (N (2) = 1/D). Changes in species composition were assessed by dissimilarity matrices. The spectral diversity indicators were calculated from the combination of image resolutions and spectral plot extents, and then compared with field diversities. The low-resolution-narrow extent based spectral indicators showed the highest correlations with canopy and total diversities. The best spectral indicators were derived from the scores of the first axis of principal component analysis and from the near infrared band, reaching high correlations with both canopy and total field diversity indices. Of the six field diversities, J' showed the highest correlations with single spectral indicators, and N (1, 2) showed the highest correlations with pairs of spectral indicators. The correlations between spectral and field dissimilarities were lower than the correlations between alpha-diversities and spectral indicators, and were unaffected by the resolution and extent. In conclusion, the best spectral indicators were obtained from the low-resolution-narrow extent combination, and the indicators estimated canopy and total field diversity indices of temperate forests equally.

J	Norris, KC				Norris, Kimberly C.			Quantifying change through time in spider assemblages: sampling methods, indices and sources of error	JOURNAL OF INSECT CONSERVATION												Using a sample dataset from six sites in the Southern Appalachian mountains in the United States, I evaluate the usefulness of diversity indices and similarity/difference indices for monitoring the changes in spider (Order Araneae) assemblages through time. The Shannon index, Brillouin index, Simpson's index and Margalef's index were correlated with each other and were able to detect successional changes in two old clear-cuts as well as disturbance to a Beech gap forest possibly due to Beech Bark Disease. Turnover, Bray-Curtis similarity, and Morisita-Horn similarity also detected successional differences between the forest types and indicated the short-term and long-term changes in a mature forest stand. Seasonal changes (early to late summer) in spider communities were consistently higher than yearly changes. I identify and discuss the implications of various sources of error that will adversely affect the accuracy and efficiency of a monitoring protocol: sensitivity of indices to sample size, sampler bias, inclusion of juveniles, taxonomic uncertainty and stochastic sampling effects. Although gross trends are still apparent in the sample data regardless of these errors, more subtle changes may be obscured. It is these subtle trends which may be more useful to managers attempting to identify disturbance before irreversible damage occurs.																			1366-638X	1572-9753				DEC	1999	3	4					309	325		10.1023/A:1009600813111	http://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1009600813111													WOS:000208368900008

The study focused on the respondent's socioeconomic status, feedstock production potential, and mapped the relevant actors along the supply chain. Structured questionnaires were administered to 117 respondents chosen through random and purposeful sampling. The descriptive statistics, linear regression models, feedstock potential model, and Simpson's diversity index were used to analyze the data. The findings showed average ages of 54.4 and 48.4 for farmers and processors respectively, with above 40% literacy. Seventy-six percent of the plantations' land belongs to the respondents with corresponding average yields of 9.5 tons/yr and 1082.5 logs for latex and parawood as the main products. Farmers and processors had a mean annual para rubber income of USD 6341.35 and 2.55 million USD, respectively. The analysis revealed a significant relationship between plantation size and feedstock supply; the theoretical feedstock potential is 831,630.91 tons and is highly diverse (Simpson's diversity index of 0.75), indicative of high potential for sustainable production and consumption. The study highlights that low latex prices alone cannot account for the decline in rubber feedstock yield, due to the high cost of new land, the inability of farmers to expand plantations, and four interlinked feedstock supply lines existing in the study area.

After confirming the identity of Alder trees (Alnus subcordata L., Betulaceae) at the edge of forest roads, the cross section geometry was classified into without earth works and with earth works. Road clearing limits were divided into less than 10 metres and 10-15 metres. The understory density and canopy cover underneath Alder stands were measured in 20 micro plots. The diversity of woody and herbaceous plant species was calculated by the Simpson index. The results indicated that the canopy cover at the edge of cross sections without earth works was greater than that of sections with earth works at a probability level of 5%. In both classes, the percentage of Rubus hyrcanus L. canopy cover on filled slopes was more than that on cut slopes, whereas the percentage of canopy cover of this species and of bare soil was similar, as well as the biodiversity indices for both sides of cross sections without earth works.

This research aimed to investigate the diversity and community structure of arthropods in the rice ecosystem. It was conducted in Lembah Seulawah, Aceh Besar Regency, Indonesia from February to August 2016. Sweep net was used to collect insects on four rice plots at 35, 45 and 55 days after transplanting (DAT) as vegetative, transition and generative stages respectively. The result showed that the twenty-five morpho-species found at vegetative stage was the highest among the three stages. They were categorized as phytophagous insects, spiders, predatory insects, parasitoid, and neutral insects. Each arthropod's category the highest among the three stages was in the higher abundance at vegetative stage, except for phytophagous arthropod. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H') was significantly higher at vegetative stage than those at remaining stages, while Simpson Dominance (C) and Species Evenness (E) indices were not significantly different among the three observed stages.

MLVA, phage typing, and PFGE methods were applied on 34 diverse Salmonella Enteritidis isolates from human and non-human sources. MLVA detected allelic variations that helped to classify the S. Enteritidis isolates into more evenly distributed subtypes than other methods. MLVA-based S. Enteritidis clonal groups were largely associated with sources of the isolates. Nei's diversity indices for polymorphism ranged from 0.25 to 0.70 for seven VNTR loci markers. Based on Simpson's and Shannon's diversity indices, MLVA had a higher discriminatory power than pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), phage typing, or multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Therefore, MLVA may be used along with PFGE to enhance the effectiveness of the molecular epidemiologic investigation of S. Enteritidis infections.																			0378-1097					OCT	2007	275	1					16	23		10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00875.x	http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1574-6968.2007.00875.x								17692097					WOS:000249428700003

In addition, we evaluated the relationships of these ecological attributes with variations in the hydrologic regime, considering the possible effects of natural (climatic events) and artificial (discharge control by dams) disturbances. Annual variations in hydrometric attributes were calculated using PULSO software and daily water level data. We applied analysis of covariance to determine the relationships between ecological and hydrometric attributes, the latter summarized in axes of a principal component analysis. Lower values of the fish assemblage attributes (diversity and abundance) were registered in the Parand River. Species richness, total CPUE and CPUE of long-distance migratory species were positively related to the duration of the floods and the connectivity of the area. Variations in the annual hydrological cycle and their effects on fish assemblage appear to be affected by extreme natural (ENSO) and artificial (discharge control by dams) events.

Weed seed-bank responses to long-term fertilization in a rice-wheat rotation system	PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT												We studied the heterogeneity of soil weed seed-bank in a rice-wheat rotation system after long-term application of different organic or non-organic fertilizers, and the effects of major nutrients on the characteristics of the weed seed-bank. The soil was sampled in the Taihu area after a 31-year long-term fertilization experiment. Weed seeds were identified and counted in the surface soil of 12 differentially treated areas using microscopic examination, and analyzed by the Simpson, Shannon, Margalef, and Pielou indexes. The long-term application of organic fertilizers could significantly reduce the density of soil weed seed-bank; non-organic fertilizers and a combination of non-organic and organic fertilizers had a significant influence on the number of species and diversity of weeds. The application of organic fertilizers improved the Simpson, Shannon and Pielou indexes of soil weed seed-bank community and stabilized the community structure. In terms of the soil nutrient system itself, the soil organic materials and total nitrogen content are the main environmental factors affecting the distribution of soil weed seed-bank.

J	Fontana, S; Sattler, T; Bontadina, F; Moretti, M				Fontana, Simone; Sattler, Thomas; Bontadina, Fabio; Moretti, Marco			How to manage the urban green to improve bird diversity and community structure	LANDSCAPE AND URBAN PLANNING												Urbanization is a fundamental environmental change, today happening at accelerated speed worldwide. Despite the strong and permanent human impact, urban biodiversity has generally proved to be surprisingly high. Quantitative information on the effect of management actions on biodiversity is often lacking but is an indispensable basis for decisions by urban planners and managers. We therefore quantified key urban variables to predict changes in avian biodiversity when their urban habitat is modified. We analysed species richness, diversity (Simpson index) and community composition of 63 bird species with reference to major urban environmental gradients at 96 sampling points in three Swiss cities. Best explanatory models were selected from candidate models following information theory, and their respective predictions were averaged based on AlCc-weights. Bird species richness and diversity are negatively affected by increasing fractions of sealed area or buildings, while increasing vegetation structures, in particular trees, show positive effects. Our models predict an increase from 13 species in the absence of trees to 20 species with 46% tree cover (+54%). Coniferous trees help to maximize bird species richness, with the models predicting an increase from 14 species at sites with only deciduous woody plants to 20 species (+43%) at places with equal representation of coniferous and deciduous plants. While the analysis of the Simpson index did not show any influence of the coniferous and broadleaf woody plants mixture, partial redundancy analysis revealed such an influence on bird community composition. highlighting the importance to consider several measures when analyzing biodiversity.

The methods based on macrophytes are generally recruited to present trustworthy assessments of ecological status for surface water bodies. The chief goal of the present investigation was to improve robust machine learning models (MLMs) to establish relationships among macrophyte indices and the simultaneous effects of water quality parameters (WQPs) and hydromorphological factors. In the present research, the dataset included monthly WQPs, which have been accumulated from 200 sample points located in the bottomland of studied rivers, placed in Poland. This research utilized three ecological indices, namely the macrophyte index for rivers (MIR), the macrophyte biological index for rivers (IBMR), and river macrophyte nutrient index (RMNI) whereas species richness (N) and Simpson index (D) were considered as diversity indices. 12 WQPs and two hydromorphological indices have been considered as input variables for the MLMs namely gene-expression programming (GEP), evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR), multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS), and model tree (MT). In terms of the best performance of MLMs' results, RMNI predictions were obtained by EPR (correlation coefficient [R] = 0.6061 and root mean square error [RMSE] = 0.5355) whereas MIR, IBMR, species richness, and Simpson index were predicted by MARS (R = 0.4333 and RMSE = 11.5046), EPR (R = 0.6020 and RMSE = 1.6923), GEP (R = 0.6089 and RMSE = 7.7229), and MARS (R = 0.5066 and RMSE = 0.2217), respectively. The great impact of these indexes was evaluated by the statistical parameters. This study showed that the biological assessment of rivers through macrophyte indexes not only helps to broaden knowledge related to the ecological status of the river but also aids in managing natural and anthropogenic activities' impacts on the water body.																			1436-3240	1436-3259				2023 OCT 29	2023										10.1007/s00477-023-02593-z	http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00477-023-02593-z		OCT 2023											WOS:001089147100001

In this forested site, Compartment 22, Compartment 26, Compartment 31, and Compartment 32 were considered for the. The vegetation inventory was conducted from October 2019 to February 2021. A total of 24 quadrats 31.62 m 31.62m (0.1ha size) were randomly established cover entire forest area and tree species density, frequency and diversity were enumerated. We identified a total 1861 individual tree based on dbh > 10 cm counting which belongs to 49 species and 24 family. The Fabaceae family had the most occurring species (7 species), followed by Anacardiaceae (4 species) and Rubiaceae (4 species). The number of tree species encountered vary from 107 to 158 populations, stem density from 340 to 1240 stem ha(1), and basal area from 0.0017m(2) to 19.91m(2) in the study. The diversity index of Shannon-Wiener, Margalef, and Simpson index were 3.892, 6.45, and 0.886 respectively. Tree species belonging to Dipterocarpus had the greatest Importance Value Index (61.93), followed by Phyllanthaceae (36.21) and Lamiaceae (36.20). The plant population in this forest growing in their natural setting found to be highly diverse and stable based on patterns in diversity indexes. The study sites were found densely vegetated with high level of species community structure, however intensive level of cattle ranching and human pressure for NTPF collections exposed some of the valuable species to poor abundance and degrading populations.

J	Walter, J; Suchácková Bartonová, A; Faltynek Fric, Z				Walter, Jan; Suchackova Bartonova, Alena; Faltynek Fric, Zdenek			The impact of a forest fire event on moth assemblages in Western Bohemia, Czech Republic	POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY												Fire has major impact on species diversity in natural ecosystems around the world. The consequences of fires for invertebrates can be immediate, and recovery of species assemblages may be a long-term process. We recorded moth communities from May to November 2019 in a pine forest in Western Bohemia, Czech Republic, where a local fire occurred in April of that year. We used UV light traps at one burned site and two neighboring unburned sites with a similar character as the burned site before the fire event. We analyzed moth assemblages using several species diversity indices - index of dominance, Shannon-Wiener index and Shannon- Wiener evenness, Simpson index, and Chao1 non-parametric estimation. We detected 67 species at the burned site, and 97 and 106 at the unburned sites. The three most frequently trapped species at all sites were Macaria liturata, Buphalus piniaria and Thera obeliscata, representing common forest geometrid moths. We observed a decline in species number and abundance at the burned site compared to the unburned sites, probably due to the direct mortality of larvae. On the contrary, the burned site was more diverse according to the diversity indices. The fire disrupted the original character of the coniferous forest, which was proved by a decline of species feeding on conifers and Vaccinium spp. The burned site attracted species associated with dry habitats such as Eublemma purpurina, Charissa obscurata and Scopula rubiginata. Even though wildfires are viewed negatively in general, they might temporarily enhance diversity in a homogeneous landscape.

We comparatively studied two forests, Larix principis-rupprechtii forest (LF) and mixed Larix principis-rupprechtii and Betula platyphylla forest (MF), which hold 30 years of stand age and are the representative forests in the mountainous area of northwestern Hebei, China. The field experiments were conducted from May to November 2020, with soil fauna and litter samples taken every one and a half months. A total of 540 soil samples (replicated samples, 3) were collected in each forest and the soil faunas were extracted from the samples by Tullgren methods in laboratory. Litter samples were incubated separately in the sampled forests using litterbags with two mesh sizes (0.01 and 4 mm) to observe the decomposition rate. In total, 2958 (inds.) soil faunas belonging to 4 phyla, 11 classes, and 20 orders, were found, with Acarina (1079/2958; 36.48%) and Collembola (1080/2958; 36.51%) being the dominant groups. The total abundance of soil fauna in the MF (1581 inds.) was higher than that in the LF (1377 inds.), and the significantly more abundant predatory functional group in the MF (p < 0.05) may indicate a more complex soil fauna food web structure. Comparatively, the higher Shannon-Wiener index (1.42-1.74) and Pielou evenness index (0.58-0.71) and the lower Simpson dominance index (0.22-0.32) in the MF suggested that the MF promoted the soil fauna diversity. The cumulative litter decomposition rate of litterbags with 4 mm aperture in the MF (54.52% in 300 days) was higher than that in the LF (32.81% in 300 days). Moreover, the litter decomposition rate was positively correlated with the total abundance and the number of groups, and was negatively with the Simpson dominance index, implying that the soil fauna activity effectively improved litter decomposition in the MF. Via the comparison, we found that the mixture of plant species in the forest can modulate the soil fauna diversity and accelerate the litter decomposition. The results in this study may provide an interesting reference for forest restoration and sustainable management.

However, urbanization has largely destroyed the original native ecosystems and has caused a homogenization where frequently native species are replaced by non-native species. When attempting to understand the role of trees in urban settings, it is important to generate science-based data on the spatial distribution of trees, their species composition and tree species diversity as a function of the degree of urbanization. Such information may specifically inform the planning of effective long-term management of trees across urban and rural gradients. A total of 23 of 1 ha each were surveyed along a Northern research transect laid out along the urban-rural gradient of the metropolitan area of Bengaluru, India. Plots were randomly selected from the stratum "settlement areas", where WorldView-3 imagery supported both stratification and plot selection. The plots were fully mapped for trees, where a total of eleven variables had been observed for each tree. In addition, the basal area and wood volume was calculated to understand the biomass potential of the trees in the plots. The diversity indices such as the Shannon index, Simpson index, Pielou's evenness and Margalef's richness were considered for comparing the species diversity, composition and distribution along the gradient of Bengaluru. A total of 1128 individuals of 93 tree species were recorded. Among 92 species identified along the northern gradient, 53 are exotic, and 39 are native species. The Shannon-Wiener index varied from 1.33 to 2.72; Simpson's index varied from 0.65 to 0.90; Pielou's index varied from 0.66 to 0.90, and Margalef's index ranged from 1.41 to 5.20 along the gradient. The basal area increased from 96.39 m(2) to 102.76 m(2) from 2017 to 2019 along the transect, with a net gain of 6.37 m(2). Similarly, the wood volume increased from 1819.57 m(3) to 1926.23 m(3) with a net gain of 106.66 m(3). The present study reports on tree distribution, species composition and tree species diversity along a gradient from the city center to the rural surroundings of northern parts of Bengaluru city. The information generated may support the city planners/administrators by providing a holistic understanding of the species composition and abundance for a further selection of adaptive species and appropriate tree and vegetation management practices to conserve the existing green spaces and contribute towards sustainable urban planning. The sample plots laid out may also serve as permanent observation plots for monitoring the dynamics of tree cover in the city.

Can people change the ecological rules that appear general across space?	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY												AimProjections of human impact on the environment and biodiversity patterns are crucial if we are to prevent their destruction. Such projections usually involve the assumption that the same human activities always affect biodiversity in the same way, either in geographically distant areas within the same time-scale or in the same areas in different periods. In this paper, plant and snail fossils from central Europe that cover the last 12,000 years provide evidence against this assumption. LocationCentral Europe. MethodsWe examined fossil data on central European plants and snails and extracted time-series of (1) local species richness (alpha diversity) at a scale of approximately 300mx300m and decays of (2) the Jaccard index and (3) Simpson's beta with increasing distance (up to approximately 400 km) through time. ResultsWe show that two vital biodiversity patterns follow neither oxygen-isotope nor borehole temperature proxies, but instead vary between archaeologically known periods, with the most noticeable and irreversible breaks (1) when arable agriculture was introduced into central Europe, (2) when the Roman Empire collapsed, and (3) during the event known as the 12th-century colonization in central Europe. The patterns computed from data across time sometimes contradicted the patterns computed across space. Main conclusionsWe therefore infer that people can, and sometimes have, contributed to temporal changes in ecological rules that are seemingly general across space. Our findings indicate that the changes in ecological rules are so substantial that efforts to project future biodiversity based on space-for-time substitution might fail, unless we gain knowledge about how these general rules are altered.

Data on diet of 12 randomly chosen families were collected in monthly samples of meals over a period of one year. Simpson indices were calculated for animal foods (as a measure of niche breadth) and for fish catches. We found that, in some months, the animal foods in the diets of families conform to predictions from the ecological theory of niche. Market prices of fish and of animal food also have influence on the niche of families. Some families with high income tend to have a narrow niche, concentrate on appreciated food and consume relatively more calories. Food diversity on Buzios is somewhat higher than in other human communities, probably due to the unpredictable environment found in maritime fishing communities.

A total of 386 samples (vegetables, soil, water, and fertilizer with manure) were examined. The identification of bacterial isolates was performed using PCR and characterized using ERIC-PCR and BOX-PCR. The discriminating power of the typing method was analyzed using Simpson's Index of Diversity. Thirty-four (n=34) Listeria isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility test using the disc-diffusion technique. The PCR analysis revealed that Listeria spp. were present in 7.51% (29/386) of all the samples (vegetable, soil, fertilizer, and water). None of the samples examined were positive for the presence of L. monocytogenes. Percentages of 100% (15/15) and 73.30% (11/15) of the listeria spp. isolated from vegetables, fertilizer, and soil from organic farm B had indistinguishable DNA fingerprints by using ERIC-PCR and BOX-PCR, respectively. Listeria spp. isolated from 86 samples of vegetable, fertilizer, and environment of organic farm A and conventional farm C had distinct DNA fingerprints. Simpson's Index of Diversity, D, of ERIC-PCR and BOX-PCR is 0.604 and 0.888, respectively. Antibiotic susceptibility test revealed that most of the Listeria spp. in this study were found to be resistant to ampicillin, rifampin, penicillin G, tetracycline, clindamycin, cephalothin, and ceftriaxone. The isolates had MAR index ranging between 0.31 and 0.85. In conclusion, hygienic measures at farm level are crucial to the reduction of Listeria transmission along the food chain.

Apart from pollinators they play a major key role in food chain, being prey for birds, reptiles, spiders and predatory insects. It is one of the most important assemblages of insects that act as biodiversity indicators as well as nature's gardeners. The objective of the present survey is focussed on the assessment of the diversity and abundance of butterfly conservation priorities in the study area. A total of 33 species of butterflies under 5 families and 26 genera were recorded during from December 2017 to February 2017 in the Kalimahal College campus, Sembarnarkoil, Tharangambadi Taluk. Nymphalidae was recorded as the most dominant family in terms of number of species (13) and number of genera (9), followed by Pieridae 8 species (6 genera), Lycaenidae 6 species (5 genera), Hesperiidae 3 species (3 genera), and Papilionidae 3 species (2 genera). Species richness (25), Simpson diversity index (0.7206) and Shannon 'H' index (1.783) were high in the month of December 2017. Simultaneously the Dominance index (0.6634) and Species Evenness (0.2871) were high in the month of February 2018. The outcomes of the present study highlight the importance of institutional campuses as a preferred habitat for butterflies. If the landscaping and maintenance of gardens are cautiously planned, the diversity of butterflies may increase in college campus providing a rich ground for butterfly conservation as well as for research.

A total of 48 plots were established along the slope, ranging from 1,400 to 3,000m asl. The investigated vegetation communities covered all community types along the altitude gradient. Using TWINSPAN classification, GAM model diversity index fitting and comprehensive DCCA sorting analysis, the results showed that: (1) Plant genera and species were relatively diverse. Rosaceae, Cruciferae, Leguminosae, Compositae, Poaceae and Labiatae were relatively abundant, seed propagation was dominant. (2) Four vegetation vertical bands were classified from high to low elevation as sub-alpine meadow, coniferous forest, mountain steppe and desert steppe, respectively. (3) Total species richness, Simpson index, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou evenness index exhibited multiple peaks with the increase in elevation gradient, although only the last Pielou evenness index peak was very obvious. (4) The specific species diversity index pattern observed along the northern slope of the Usun Mountains was likely related to climate and soil nutrient status, and was specific for the Tianshan Mountains. (5) Under complex mountainous terrain, the differences in biotope conditions were very significant. The combination of elevation, slope, soil moisture, available phosphorus, available potassium and pH influenced and controlled the formation of community distribution patterns on the northern slope. This study revealed vegetation distribution patterns and their relationship with the environment on the northern slope of the Usun Mountains and provided important information for biodiversity conservation and the development.
