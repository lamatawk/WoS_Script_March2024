The current study was designed to investigate the distribution pattern, community structure, phytosociological attributes, associated flora and conservation of Taxus wallichiana in the temperate forests of the state of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Pakistan. Objectives included the creation of GIS-based maps for a detailed representation of Taxus wallichiana distribution in AJK and the identification of its highly fragmented and rapidly dwindling habitats for strategic conservation management. Data was meticulously gathered from 51 temperate forest sites across 6 districts in AJK using quadrate-based systematic sampling. Site selection was based on thorough preliminary surveys of Yew populations in the region. Yew populations at the sampled sites exhibited an average stem density of 371 trees/ha with average basal area cover of 132.12 cm. The species showed extremely low regeneration of 3.35/ha. Floristic inventory revealed a total of 154 plant species belonging to 113 Genera and 50 families as associated flora in the Taxus wallichiana populations. The average values of Simpson's diversity index were recorded as 0.97, Shannon's Diversity as 3.71, Menhinick's species richness as 1.21, Pielou's species evenness as 2.13 whereas community maturity index was 54.26%. Analysis of Life form and Leaf size classes showed that herbaceous Hemicryptophytic microphyllous taxa dominated the local flora. GIS analysis revealed North Facing slopes with moderate degree of steepness and having concave curvature in the moist temperate forest zone as the main habitat of the Taxus wallichiana. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) showed that the species was distributed in an altitudinal range of 1900-2800 m. Significant levels of deforestation recorded as 3.18 Yew stumps/ha synchronized with over grazing and erosion in the study area posing serious threat to the Taxus populations which can lead to local extinction of this species. Through GIS analysis, we precisely mapped both robust and imperiled Taxus populations in AJK, offering vital insights for the conservation management of this species. Cluster Analysis and Pearson's correlation revealed significant associations among the investigated variables and sampling sites. We urgently recommend immediate conservation measures to safeguard the imperiled Yew populations in the AJK region.

Rubber tree powdery mildew, caused by Erysiphe quercicola, is a serious threat to rubber plantations worldwide, especially in subtropical environments including all rubber tree-growing regions in China. However, the population structure of the pathogen is uncertain. In this study, 16 polymorphic microsatellite markers were used to genotype powdery mildew samples from the main rubber tree-growing regions including Yunnan (YN), Hainan (HN), western Guangdong (WG), and eastern Guangdong (EG). YN had higher genotypic diversity (Simpson's indices), genotypic evenness, Nei's gene diversity, allelic richness, and private allelic richness than the other regions. Cluster analysis, discriminant analysis of principal components, pairwise divergence, and shared multilocus genotype analyses all showed that YN differed significantly from the other regions. The genetic differentiation was small among the other three regions (HN, WG, and EG). Analysis of molecular variance indicated that the variability among regions accounted for 22.37% of the total variability. Genetic differentiation was significantly positively correlated (R-xy = 0.772, P = 0.001) with geographic distance. Linkage equilibrium analysis suggested possible occurrence of sexual recombination although asexual reproduction predominates in E. quercicola. The results suggested that although significant genetic differentiation of E. quercicola occurred between YN and the other regions, pathogen populations from the other three regions lacked genetic differentiation.

Information on fish assemblages and diversity in the Western Indian Ocean region is limited complicating management of the fisheries. In this study, we determined longline catch rates, species diversity indices, species richness, and species evenness for fish assemblages of Kenya's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) through experimental surveys conducted using a commercial Fishing Vessel (FV) between April and October 2020. A total of 110 sets were conducted where 4217 specimens of 50 species and 23 families were caught. The catches were mainly composed of Xiphias gladius (70.2%), Prionace glauca (7.8%), and Thunnus obesus (4.4%). About 15.0% of the catches were discarded of which 11.3% comprised of fish no commercial value. High levels of endangered, threatened and protected species forming 5.5% of the catches were observed. Catch rates were high for the dominant species in the three zones and differed significantly between months. Species abundance, richness, Shannon-Weiner diversity, and Simpson's diversity indices were highest at the nearshore zone and during August. However, the diversity indices were not statistically different both for the zones and months. The nearshore zone exhibited higher species assemblages and greater species richness compared to other zones. This suggests the importance of prioritizing conservation efforts in the nearshore zone, as it serves as a critical habitat for diverse fish populations. Implementing protective measures can help preserve the biodiversity and sustainability of fish assemblages in the nearshore zone.

J	Belete, Mulugeta Dadi								Ecohydrological nature-based solution for climate resilience and biodiversity enhancement in water-limited ecosystem: Perspectives and proof of concepts								ECOHYDROLOGY & HYDROBIOLOGY				23	4			507	517		10.1016/j.ecohyd.2023.08.011			OCT 2023	2023	Following the declaration of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, nature-based solutions (NbS) are at the forefront of the sustainability discourse. However, this solution needs operational clarity to avoid the commonly mentioned vagueness of the concept. This paper highlighted application of the ecohydrological principles to guide the conception, planning, designing, implementation, and monitoring of nature-based solutions. The paper proposed an ecohydrological nature-based solution that is emanated from the natural sequence of self-regulating patch-interpatch at the hillslope scale to restore highly degraded hillslope in Lake Hawassa sub-basin of Ethiopian Rift Valley Basin. The active restoration site is found to have a landscape organization index value of 0.94 (= 94% of the gradsect is consisting of resources conserving patches) as compared to 0.16 at the passive site. In terms of landscape functionality, the active site showed significant stability (p(x 0.01), infiltration (p(x 0.001), and nutrient cycling (p(x 0.005). It also exhibited significant improvement in soil moisture (p(x 0.001). Ecologically, the active site is found to be more diverse (richness index 18 (active) vs. 8 (passive); heterogeneous (Shannon diversity index = 1.22 (active) vs. 0.44 (passive)); well distributed (Simpson's index= 0.62 (active) vs. 0.28 (passive)); less dominance of few species (Evenness index (0.99 (passive) vs. 0.96 (active)). Limitation of this study is linked with the short span of the restoration period which tends to be not adequate to observe the full 'dual' regulation between hydrology and biota. For this, the research can be considered as a prerequisite towards full restoration of the landscape.(c) 2023 European Regional Centre for Ecohydrology of the Polish Academy of Sciences.

J	Mellisse, Beyene Teklu; Tolera, Motuma; Derese, Ararsa								Traditional homegardens change to perennial monocropping of khat (Catha edulis) reduced woody species and enset conservation and climate change mitigation potentials of the Wondo Genet landscape of southern Ethiopia								HELIYON				10	1					e23631	10.1016/j.heliyon.2023.e23631			JAN 15 2024	2024	Smallholder farmers in the Wondo Genet were forced to switch from long-standing, diverse traditional home gardens to monoculture khat production due to increasing population pressureinduced farmland constraints. The composition of woody species and the biomass carbon stock are thought to drop as homegardens transition from polyculture to monoculture; however there is little quantitative evidence to support this claim. This study was started to assess the effects on woody species, enset, and biomass carbon of converting traditional homegardens to a fast spreading perennial monocropping of khat (Catha edulis Forskal). In 10 m x 10 m (100m2) plots from 43 farms with neighboring land use patterns for each homegarden and khat, woody species and enset were inventoried, the total number of tree, shrub, and enset species counted, as well as the height and diameter of each species measured. To determine the biomass carbon stock of each land use type, both general and species-specific allometric equations are used. Simpson's diversity index, Shannon-Wiener, and Shannon equitability were used to evaluate the diversity of enset and woody species. There were 27 different types of woody species identified, with trees making up 67 % of the total and shrubs accounting for 33 %. Shannon, Simpson, and the richness of woody species all decreased by 46 %, 51 %, and 38 %, respectively, in comparison to residential gardens. For homegardens and khat, respectively, the mean Evenness values were 0.876 and 0.539. In homegardens, Coffea arabica was the most valuable woody species, followed by Cordia africana Lam, Persea americana, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, and Grevillea Robusta. In contrast, Catha edulis was the most valuable woody species in the Khat land use type, followed by Coffea arabica, Croton macrostachyus Del, and Cordia africana. In comparison to homegardens, the aboveground, below-ground, and total biomass carbon reported in khat land use types were reduced by 18 %, 63 %, and 42 %, respectively. Grevillea and Eucalyptus species made up 51 % of the total biomass carbon stock in the homegardens, which suggests that khat and quickly expanding fast-growing plants have displaced native woody species.Understanding the long-term effects of agro-biodiversity loss requires greater research on the implications of the decline in woody species diversity and biomass carbon stock on soil fertility and sustainable farming. This is due to the numerous functions that woody species and enset play.

The impacts of thermocline stratification intensity on biodiversity-ecosystem relationships were assessed using phytoplankton and zooplankton indicators from four stages of stratification in Lake Qiandaohu. There were significant differences in biomass, species diversity, and resource use efficiency (RUEpp = phytoplankton biomass/total phosphorus) for phytoplankton between continuous stratification and mixing periods, but only in FDis and RaoQ diversity indices for zooplankton. Phytoplankton species diversity and RUE were higher in the formative and stable periods, while zooplankton species diversity and zooplankton biomass/phytoplankton biomass (RUEzp) were lower. When combining the data from the four periods, a negative linear pattern was found between phytoplankton Simpson's, functional dispersion (FDis), and Rao's Quadratic (RaoQ) diversity indices, and thermocline depth (TD). Only zooplankton FDis and RaoQ diversity indices were significantly positively related to TD. Phytoplankton RUE was significantly negatively related only to its Pielou's evenness (J) diversity, while zooplankton RUE was significantly negatively related to its J, FDis, and RaoQ diversity indices.

J	Dong, Hangna; Chen, Yu; Huang, Xiancheng								A new framework for analysis of the spatial patterns of 15-minute neighbourhood green space to enhance carbon sequestration performance: A case study in Nanjing, China								ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				156						111196	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111196			DEC 1 2023	2023	As the most fundamental unit of urban development, the performance of green space carbon sequestration in neighborhoods is, therefore, a crucial factor in the pursuit of carbon neutrality. Consequently, studying the performance of carbon sequestration from the spatial structure of green spaces in conjunction with the recreational features of the neighborhood is urgent and necessary. Herein, for the first time, we combined four types of indicators, namely carbon sequestration, green space spatial structure, natural environment, and human activities, using three types of 15-minute neighborhoods in the Nanjing metropolitan area as an example. As observed, the area indicator percentage of landscape (PLAND) contributed directly to the carbon sequestration of green areas and also influenced the carbon sequestration by affecting the average normalized vegetation index (NDVI) level; the shape indicator Simpson's evenness index (SIEI) not only helped to reduce the average temperature in the neighborhood but also improved the average NDVI level, both of which can contribute to carbon sequestration; the aggregation indicators aggregation index (AI) had no direct effect on the carbon sequestration performance but contributed to it by lowering the temperature. Thus, the current study revealed the mechanism by which the spatial characteristics of residential green spaces influenced carbon sequestration and proposed a new direction for future sustainable urban development.

J	Tang, Zhonglin; Wang, Yuting; Fu, Min; Xue, Jingyue								The role of land use landscape patterns in the carbon emission reduction: Empirical evidence from China								ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				156						111176	10.1016/j.ecolind.2023.111176			DEC 1 2023	2023	The regulation of land use landscape patterns to achieve carbon reduction in pursuit of carbon neutrality has not received sufficient attention. Existing studies have largely focused on specific land use types, such as urban built-up areas. As a result, such studies lack comprehensive regional research, hindering the formulation of integrated carbon reduction policies and sustainable land use planning. Taking the Yangtze River Economic Belt as the study object, this study constructs a quantitative analysis framework that conducts regional land use carbon emission evaluation, landscape pattern analysis, dynamic correlation examination, and measures their respective mechanisms. The results indicate that cropland in the Yangtze River Economic Belt has progressively decreased over the last 20 years (-3.32 %), whilst wetland areas have experienced slow growth (1.81 %) and built-up land has expanded significantly (90.14 %) over the same period. Except for the Interspersion and juxtaposition index (IJI) and Modified Simpson's evenness index (MEISI), other indices exhibit a decreasing trend with distinct temporal characteristics. By designing and deploying an annual panel regression model, this study quantifies the impact of land use and landscape pattern changes on carbon emissions from a regional perspective. The results reveal that lower levels of landscape heterogeneity and fragmentation and a lower concentration of urban built-up land are conducive to carbon reduction; contrastingly, a decrease in landscape complexity and connectivity increases carbon emissions. Finally, recommendations are put forward regarding land use landscape patterns under the framework of carbon neutrality.

J	Demie, Gadisa; Negash, Mesele; Asrat, Zerihun; Bohdan, Lojka								Perennial plant species composition and diversity in relation to socioecological variables and agroforestry practices in central Ethiopia								AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS				98	2			461	476		10.1007/s10457-023-00924-1			FEB 2024	2024	Tropical deforestation and forest degradation have resulted in substantial losses of goods and services and a decline in the quality of life. Agroforestry is a viable land-use option to counteract such declines in ecosystem services, including biodiversity and supporting local livelihoods. However, it is unclear how socioecological factors mediate these roles, which hinders the implementation of initiatives to conserve biodiversity. This study aimed to investigate perennial plant species composition and diversity in relation to socioecological variables and agroforestry practices in central Ethiopia. The vegetation data were collected from 243 sample farms that belonged to 81 randomly chosen households from nine kebeles. Across all practices, 92 plant species from 75 genera and 46 families were identified. Of these, 77% were native plant species, and the remaining were exotic ones. Margalef species richness and the Shannon diversity index were both significantly higher (p < 0.05) in homegardens and middle elevations. Furthermore, species richness and the Shannon diversity index were positively and significantly related to slope, farm size, farm age, and wealth status. Parklands, lowland altitude, and younger farms had the highest Simpson's evenness, whereas wealth status, farm size, and slope had no significant association with Simpson's evenness. Overall, this study showed that agroforestry serves as a refuge for native species and helps reverse species loss in natural forests. However, native species are gradually being replaced with exotic species, compromising the integrity of agricultural landscapes. Our study also emphasizes the urgent need to consider socioecological factors when examining biodiversity and planning agricultural landscape management strategies.

Grazing pressure is an important anthropogenic driver, but stochastic environmental events such as rainfall variability and prolonged drought can have profound effects on arid vegetation. We investigated the effect of a prolonged drought and initial high grazing pressure on range condition, perennial vegetation cover, life form cover, vegetation composition and vegetation diversity at five monitoring sites in a conservation area in arid Succulent Karoo vegetation. The response of the rocky mountainous vegetation to drought and grazing differed notably from the response of the sandy plains vegetation. Range condition and perennial vegetation cover reduced drastically in all habitats, although the extent of deterioration was less in the mountainous habitats. Annual vegetation cover was associated with inter-annual rainfall variability. Species richness decreased at three of five sites, whereas species evenness increased at three of five sites. Shannon-Wiener index of diversity and Simpson's diversity index trends were inconsistent. Vegetation composition changed directionally from a quasi-stable state in all five monitoring sites as the drought persisted. The extent of the change was less in mountainous habitats indicating potentially higher resilience than in plains habitats, though grazing pressure was lower in the mountains than on the plains over the study period. The existence of quasi-stable states, together with the observed directional changes in vegetation composition in response to both drought and grazing, indicated that both equilibrium and non-equilibrium vegetation dynamics apply.

This study investigated its effects on the multifaceted ecosystem services, including serving as a source of drinking and irrigation water and aquatic health through assessing fish diversity and characteristics. Analyses of 189 water samples from 21 sites revealed spatiotemporal variations in major ions contributing to lake water salinity. The study assessed water suitability for drinking and agriculture using the water quality index (WQI), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), magnesium hazard (MH), sodium percent (Na%), and Kelly's ratio (KR). The WQI, ranging from 141 to 408, indicated that the lake water was unfit for drinking. In some seasons, such as the pre-monsoon period, the lake water was deemed unsuitable for irrigation due to high SAR values (18 +/- 4 g/L, average +/- standard deviation), consistently rising MH values exceeding 66 in all seasons and elevated sodium percentages surpassing 66% in both the pre-monsoon and monsoon seasons. The KR remained acceptable (averaging 0.8 to 2.5) in all seasons. Fish health in highly saline conditions was assessed using data from interviews, focus group discussions, and fish sampling (1684 fish from 10 sites). Results depicted that high salt contamination severely impacted fish length and weight. The study found low richness (Simpson's biodiversity: 0.697 and Shannon Weaver: 1.51) and evenness (Pielou's index: 0.48) among the fish populations. Since 1998, Manchar Lake has seen a decline in fish varieties from 32 to 23, with changes in fish species' feeding habits. To improve lake water quality, the study recommends diverting saline water to the sea before and after the monsoon season while utilizing freshwater from alternative sources to fill any water deficit.

Despite Thane creek being a popular spot for urban birdwatchers, limited knowledge exists about this creek beyond bird species richness and particularly the charismatic flamingoes. The entire creek was divided into four localities based on the vegetation characteristic variables and 12 observation points (three under each locality). Field surveys were conducted in January and February 2018, a period when the inward migration and return migration of birds take place. We identified 125 bird species belonging to 90 genera, 47 families, and 18 orders. The most species-rich locality was Bhandup pumping station with 106 species (84.8%), while the Thane creek flamingo sanctuary was the most species abundant, with 899 individuals (33.32%). Koper khairane locality had the lowest diversity, with 75 species (60%) and 338 individuals (12.52%). Bhandup pumping station had the highest Shannon's index (4.42), while the flamingo sanctuary had the lowest values of Shannon's index (3.88), Simpson's index (0.962), and evenness index (0.86). Non-parametric multidimensional scaling revealed significant differences in bird species abundance among observation points (stress = 0.1048). Pearson's correlation test revealed significant correlation between shrub density with bird species richness (r(2) = 5.962, P < 0.05). Total abundance-based multiple site dissimilarity (beta(bc)) was 0.6174, with the balanced variation component (beta(bc.bal) = 0.4586) being higher than the abundance gradient component (beta(bc.gra) = 0.1588). This suggests that beta(bc.bal) primarily influences the bird community structure found here. The results of this study will help in understanding the avifaunal diversity found inside Thane creek of India and the conservation perspectives of creek avifauna.

Accordingly, in this study, the diversity of zooplankton in rice fields in Suphan Buri Province, a large area of rice plantations in the central region of Thailand, was examined. A total of 100 species, including 52 rotifers, 18 cladocerans, and 30 copepods, were recorded, including Mesocyclops kayi, which was a new record in Thailand. A high Simpson's diversity index (0.63) and a low Pielou's species evenness index (0.02) confirmed various potential niches for zooplankton in this ecosystem, leading to a low Jaccard similarity index both among the current rice fields and those in other regions. Moreover, the species richness estimators suggested that more species are expected to be discovered in the rice fields. Rotifer and copepod communities are influenced by local environmental variables, including dissolved oxygen, salinity, conductivity, and chlorophyll a. The results of this study fill a gap in the knowledge regarding the diversity and ecology of zooplankton in rice fields. However, further research is needed to fully comprehend the function of this ecosystem and the actual diversity in Thailand.

J	She, Yandi; Li, Xilai; Li, Chengyi; Yang, Pengnian; Song, Zihan; Zhang, Jing								Relationship between Species Diversity and Community Stability in Degraded Alpine Meadows during Bare Patch Succession								PLANTS-BASEL				12	20					3582	10.3390/plants12203582			OCT 2023	2023	Plant diversity plays an important role in maintaining the stability of ecosystem functioning. Based on field surveys and indoor analyses, this study investigated the relationship between species diversity and community stability at different stages of bare patch succession in degraded alpine meadow ecosystems. Results show that: (1) Using the ICV (the Inverse of the Coefficient of Variation) method to analyze changes in plant community stability, community stability was generally ranked as follows: Long-term recovered patches > Healthy alpine meadow > Degraded alpine meadow > Short-term recovered patch > Bare Patches. (2) Using factor analysis to construct an evaluation system, the stability ranking based on species diversity was as follows: Healthy alpine meadow > Long-term recovered patches > Degraded alpine meadow > Short-term recovered patches > Bare Patches. (3) The community stability index was significantly positively correlated with vegetation coverage, height, biomass, species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity index, species evenness, and Simpson's diversity index (p < 0.05). Therefore, a positive correlation exists between plant diversity and community stability, such that plant communities with a higher species diversity tend to be more stable. To maintain the plant diversity and community stability of alpine meadow ecosystems, it is necessary to consider the characteristics of grassland plant composition and community structure, as well as their influencing factors, and promote the positive succession process of grasslands.

The present study aimed to assess the chemodiversity and bioactivity of Juniperus formosana, Juniperus przewalskii, Juniperus convallium, Juniperus tibetica, Juniperus komarovii, and Juniperus sabina essential oils from the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The results revealed 92 components in six essential oils: alpha-pinene (2.71-17.31%), sabinene (4.91-19.83%), and sylvestrene (1.84-8.58%) were the main components. Twelve components were firstly reported in Juniperus oils, indicating that the geographical location and climatic conditions of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau produced the unique characteristics of Juniperus essential oils. The chemodiversity of Juniperus essential oils varied greatly, with J. sabina having the most recognized components (64) and the highest chemodiversity (Shannon-Wiener index of 3.07, Simpson's diversity index of 0.91, and Pielou evenness of 0.74). According to the chemodiversity of essential oils, the six plants were decided into the alpha-pinene chemotype (J. formosana), hedycaryol chemotype (J. przewalskii, J. komarovii, J. convallium, J. tibetica), and sabinene chemotype (J. sabina). PCA, HCA and OPLS-DA showed that J. formosana and J. sabina were distantly related to other plants, which provides a chemical basis for the classification of Juniperus plants. Furthermore, bioactivity tests exhibited certain antioxidant and antibacterial effects in six Juniperus oils. And the bioactivities of J. convallium, J. tibetica, and J. komarovvii were measured for the first time, broadening the range of applications of Juniperus. Correlation analysis of components and bioactivities showed that delta-amorphene, beta-udesmol, alpha-muurolol, and 2-nonanone performed well in the determination of antioxidant activity, and alpha-pinene, camphene, beta-myrcene, as well as (E)-thujone, had strong inhibitory effects on pathogenic bacteria, providing a theoretical basis for further research on these components.

Zooplankton of the marine ecosystem are microscopic myriads of diverse, floating and drifting animal-like organisms found either on or near the surface of water bodies. Zooplankton samples were collected from the surface water and substratum of the ship hull during the study period from June 2015 to May 2016. Population density ranged from 68 000 to 194 000 cells/L was recorded in the water and substratum of the ship hull. Shannon-Wiener's diversity index (H') values ranged from 4.97 to 5.57 (bits/ind) at station I and station II. Simpson's richness ranged from 0.967 and 0.977 at station I and station II. Pielou's evenness index (J') ranged from 0.976 to 0.994 at station I and station II, respectively. In total, 56 and 48 zooplankton species were recorded in water and substratum of the ship hull in the Chinnamuttom harbor water, respectively. Among the recorded zooplankton, calanoid copepod was found to be dominant followed by ciliata, cyclopoida, harpacticoida, polychaeta, amphipoda and barnacle nauplii in water samples, whereas in substratum samples the Harpacticoid copepod was predominant followed by ciliata, cyclopoida, calanoida, polychaeta, amphipoda and barnacle nauplii. Among the estimated zooplankton, the copepods were found to be dominant throughout the year in the selected site and seasons with appreciable numbers.

The gut bacterial communities exhibited significant variation across species, showcasing a diverse range of bacterial phyla, classes, and genera. Each species harbored a unique set of bacteria, yet there was considerable overlap in taxa among species. Species richness was comparable across all species. However, measures that account for both richness and evenness, such as the Shannon diversity index and the inverse Simpson's diversity index, indicated significant differences between species, especially between L. illustris and C. pinguis. The functional profiles of the gut bacterial communities mainly centered on metabolic and environmental information processing functions, with no marked differences between species. While this study had limitations in data collection, it still revealed a significant correlation between the phylogenetic distances of some fly species and the distances of their gut bacterial communities. This supports the hypothesis that the gut microbiota is not random but is influenced by the host's evolutionary history or seasons. We confirmed that an association between phylogeny and gut bacterial community structure, as determined through entanglement analysis, exists. The study focused on only five individuals from the four fly species sampled during spring and summer, which might affect the generalizability of the results. Future research would benefit from replicating this study with a larger sample size across various seasons to ensure the more widespread applicability of the findings.

J	Mudau, Naledzani; Mhangara, Paidamwoyo								Assessment of Spatial Patterns of Backyard Shacks Using Landscape Metrics								DRONES				7	9					561	10.3390/drones7090561			SEP 2023	2023	Urban informality in developing economies like South Africa takes two forms: freestanding shacks are built in informal settlements, and backyard shacks are built in the yard of a formal house. The latter is evident in established townships around South African cities. In contrast to freestanding shacks, the number of backyard shacks has increased significantly in recent years. The study assessed the spatial patterns of backyard shacks in a formal settlement containing low-cost government houses (LCHs) using Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) products and landscape metrics. The backyard shacks were mapped using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA), which uses height information, vegetation index, and radiometric values. We assessed the effectiveness of rule-based and Random Forest (RF) OBIA techniques in detecting formal and informal structures. Informal structures were further classified as backyard shacks using spatial analysis. The spatial patterns of backyard shacks were assessed using eight shapes, aggregation, and landscape metrics. The analysis of the shape metrics shows that the backyard shacks are primarily square, as confirmed by a higher shape index value and a lower fractional dimension index value. The contiguity index of backyard shack patches is 0.6. The values of the shape metrics of backyard shacks were almost the same as those of formal and informal dwelling structures. The values of the assessed aggregation metrics of backyard shacks were more distinct from formal and informal structures compared with the shape metrics. The aggregation metrics show that the backyard shacks are less connected, less dense, and more isolated from each other compared with formal and freestanding shacks. The Shannon's Diversity Index and Simpson's Evenness Index values of informal settlements and formal areas with backyard shacks are almost the same. The results achieved in this study can be used to understand and manage informality in formal settlements.

Tree individual numbers were collected in permanent sample plots which were placed in the intact zone (INT), transitional zones (TRA) and devastated zones (DEV), designed in 2007 to monitor the mangrove succession. Diversity was examined via diversity indices including tree density (D), Shannon -Wiener (H'), Evenness (E) and Simpson's Dominance index (Cd). The species numbers in the INT, TRA and DEV sections were 3, 5 and 10 respectively. The highest tree density of Rhizophora apiculata Blume was acquired in the INT and TRA zone while Avicennia spp. was the dominant species in the DEV zones. The H' and Cd indices revealed a significant difference between the DEV zone and the others in terms of species diversity. Avicennia spp. was widely distributed in the devastated zone. On the other hand, their appearance frequency in the TRA zone was low, but these species were dominant in the DEV zone. After 13 years of self-recovery, the devastated mangrove was turning into a multi-species community while the transitional zone tended to sustain the monoculture structure.

Observer error in grassland vegetation surveys: effects on species diversity metrics and species-abundance relationships								JOURNAL OF PLANT ECOLOGY				16	4					rtad002	10.1093/jpe/rtad002			AUG 1 2023	2023	We investigated the effect of observer error on four commonly used species diversity measures: species richness, Shannon-Weiner diversity, Shannon-Weiner evenness and Simpson's index of diversity. We also evaluated how observer error affects inferences derived from multivariate analyses of species-abundance relationships as determined by non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS) ordination. Grassland vegetation was sampled by three different botanists at two national park units in Missouri and Kansas, USA. The same plots were sampled by two of the botanists, who compiled lists of species composition and estimated foliar cover. Differences in the data records were then compared. Pseudoturnover (i.e. apparent turnover due to observer error) ranged from 17.1% to 22.1%, and differences in cover class estimation ranged from 21.5% to 30.5%. The percentage difference in species diversity measures between pairs of observers depended on how data were summarized, but were always <20%, and often <10%. Based on these results, species diversity metrics are affected to a relatively smaller extent by observer error than turnover indices. Turnover indices, however, contain more information because they track individual species, whereas species are interchangeable in most species diversity indices. Thus, less of the error is identified because of how species diversity indices are calculated. NMS ordinations revealed that while the characterizations of some plots by different observers were similar, differences between observers' records for other plots resulted in greater separation in ordination space. Points representing one observer's records were often shifted in ordination space in the same direction compared with the other observer.

J	He, Shan; Xu, Jijun; Yi, Yujun; Zhang, Enze								Variations in Aquatic Vegetation Diversity Responses to Water Level Sequences during Drought in Lakes under Uncertain Conditions								WATER				15	13					2395	10.3390/w15132395			JUL 2023	2023	Water level variability and temporal change are critical for shaping the structure of aquatic vegetation. Much research has examined the response of aquatic vegetation to hydrological metrics. However, the hydrological sequence is a fundamental driver of aquatic ecosystem structure and function. Given the aleatory uncertainty of future water levels under an unstable climate, how aquatic vegetation responds to changing dynamics in hydrological processes, especially shifting water level sequences, remains insufficiently explored. In this paper, we establish an evaluation framework to study the response of vegetation diversity to variation in water level sequences during a drought event. To do this, the uncertainty and variability of water level processes are both considered. Altering water level processes was achieved using two types of scenarios in order to explore the effects of differing water level sequences (i.e., changing the order of high vs. low water levels) on the probability distribution of four indexes of aquatic plant diversity (e.g., Margalef's, Simpson's, Shannon's, and Pielou's evenness index). Our results show that altering the order of water level state can lead to differences in the diversity of aquatic vegetation, with a pronounced impact on vegetation complexity. This suggests that the specific sequence of water level events is critical for shaping aquatic vegetation structure. In addition, we found that a uniform distribution of water level state is beneficial for enhancing a species' dominance in aquatic vegetation. Our findings provide guidance for improving the future development of freshwater ecosystem protection and lake management.

Investigating domestic gardens landscape plant diversity, implications for valuable plant species conservation								ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY											10.1007/s10668-023-03528-y				2023	Urbanization has resulted in deterioration of natural lands and extinction of indigenous species. Domestic gardens are neglected spots of plants biodiversity. This research aimed to assess domestic garden plants diversity, composition, distribution, and identify the conserved indigenous plant species in a heavily urbanized arid city. Domestic gardens within each district were randomly selected, visited, and surveyed. Cultivated plant species in gardens were identified and counted; their frequencies and abundance levels were calculated. Plant species richness, Shannon, evenness, and Simpson's indices were calculated. More than 12,000 plants belonging to 223 plant species compromising 72 plant families were found. Domestic gardens played a significant role in conserving regionally extinct or endangered native plant species while undesirably sustained exotic and invasive plants. Overall, exotic plants species represented 84% of all identified species. The highest percentage of native plants (29%) was found in Uhod district, while the lowest (11%) was in Jubaiha district. The minimum and maximum proportion of medicinal, poisonous, and fruit bearing plants on a district bases were 9-26%, 9-22%, and 11-43% of domestic garden plants, respectively. The highest species richness (103) was in Zahran, while the lowest (20) was in Al-Madinah district. Shannon diversity index was the highest in Zahran and Sweileh districts. Shannon, evenness, and Simpson diversity indexes revealed Badr Al-Jadidah as the lowest plant diversity district. District history, lots sizes, garden sizes, socioeconomic status, residents' preferences, and housing regulations resulted in variation in plants diversity and species composition. Thus, monitoring species composition in domestic gardens and raising public awareness about plants benefits/risks supports environmental sustainability. Attention should be given to these neglected biodiversity hotspots, especially in arid environments.		[Al-Kofahi, Salman D.

In North Western Himalaya from 2018 to 2020, evaluation of various tillage techniques with and without residue incorporation and weed management techniques on diverse weed flora composition was performed. Fifteen treatment amalgamations of five tillages viz. CT (conventional tillage) in maize-CT in wheat, CT-ZT (ZT, zero tillage), ZT-ZT, ZT-ZTR (ZTR, zero tillage in amalgamation with remainder integration) & ZTR-ZTR and three weed management practices viz. H (suggested herbicide in maize)-H (suggested herbicide in wheat), IWM-IWM (IWM, integrated weed supervision) & HW-HW; (HW, hand weeding) were calculated in strip plot design. Significant differences (p = 0.05) of weed density and total weed count were recorded during summer (maize) and winter (wheat) seasons. Among tillage treatments, lowest weed population and total weed population were recorded in conservation tillage (ZTR-ZTR) in summer and conservative tillage followed by zero tillage in winter season (CT-ZT), respectively. IWM-IWM and H-H had a least weed population and total weed population in summer and winter seasons, respectively. Highest important value index during summer and winter seasons was recorded in Echinochloa colona (55.90%) and Avena ludoviciana (76.99%), respectively. Higher Shannon Wiener index and Evenness were recorded for CT+HW-CT+HW (1.83, 0.91) and ZT +IWM-ZTR+IWM (1.73, 0.86) which indicate higher weed species diversity during summer and winter seasons, respectively. ZTR-ZTR led to less diverse weed diversity compared to intensive conventional tillage (CT-CT) practices. However, higher Simpson's diversity was recorded for CT+HW-CT+HW, i.e. 0.83 and 0.82 for maize and wheat, respectively, compared to the other conventional tillage treatments. This study helps in understanding the crop-weed relation such that the implementation of sound and economic weeds management strategies. Further, long-term experiments are required in order to interpret the complicated relationships of diverse weed species under different tillage and weed management strategies for sustainable and adoptive conservation agriculture production system for North Western Himalayas.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Modelling the ecological impact of invasive weed <i>Verbesina encelioides</i> on vegetation composition across dryland ecosystems of Punjab, northwestern India								ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT				195	6					725	10.1007/s10661-023-11299-2			JUN 2023	2023	Events of climate change have led to increased aridification, which alters local vegetation patterns and results in the invasion of opportunistic species. Though many studies assess the impact of invasive weeds and aridification at the agronomic level, studies investigating changes in local vegetation are severely lacking. We investigated the impact of the invasive plant Verbesina encelioides (Asteraceae) on the local vegetation composition across different dryland ecosystems in Punjab, northwestern India. Based on the aridity index for the period of 1991-2016, three major dryland ecosystems, i.e., arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid, were found in Punjab. The impact of V. encelioides on local biodiversity was measured in terms of species diversity (using Shannon's diversity index, Simpson's dominance index, Hill's evenness index, and Margalef's richness index), species composition (using non-metric multidimensional scaling based on Bray-Curtis's dissimilarity index), and species proportion in the two invasion classes (uninvaded and invaded) and across the three aridity zones (arid, semi-arid, and sub-humid). The vegetation survey depicted the presence of 53 flowering species belonging to 22 families, including 30 exotics and 23 natives. Verbesina encelioides decreased species diversity and proportion, with a more pronounced impact in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. In contrast, species composition varied between uninvaded and invaded classes only in arid ecosystems. Ecological parameters derived from population statistics (number of individuals) were more drastically affected than those from species abundance data. Since the ecological impacts of V. encelioides were manifested with increased aridification, it is a matter of apprehension under the potential climate change scenario.

In all the three plant life forms, Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson's diversity index and Margalef richness index showed higher species diversity and richness in NAF compared to CMAF while Sorenson's index reveals a low species similarity between the sites. Pielou's evenness was higher at NAF and a contiguous pattern was prominently distributed in both the forest. The family Poaceae, Asteraceae and Cyperaceae dominated the CMAF while Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae and Poaceae dominated NAF. The NAF has greater plant density compared to CMAF and the IVI shows the dominant status of native tree Terminalia myriocarpa in the Northeastern tropical forest. Weeds like Ageratum conyzoides, Bidens pilosa and Drymaria cordata were prominently distributed in CMAF while Abarema clypearia, Inula cappa and Strobilanthes coloratus has been obstructed by mining. The result imparted that the plant diversity of Nagaland tropical forests are under threat due to coal mining which has reduced the vegetation diversity and induce the loss of dominant plant species. As such, regulation of mine waste, land reclamation projects, robust forest management and bioremediation can be scientifically integrated to reduce the mining repercussion effects. Moreover, the result emphasizes the need to impart the tribal knowledge of preserving natural forest to the upcoming generations and develop conservation strategies to prevent further degradation or loss of biodiversity in this part of the Indo-Burma hotspot region.

The main point of this article is to show a direct equivalence between a thermodynamic framework and the classical theory of evenness. It illustrates how thermodynamically inspired terms can lead to the measures used to quantify diversity (or lack thereof), balance, evenness, consistency, or concentration. A real-world example based on intersectional inequalities in science is used as an illustration.

Effects of seining effort on estimates of fish diversity in a sand-bed river								ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT				195	5					538	10.1007/s10661-023-11166-0			MAY 2023	2023	Changes in species diversity can be an indicator of ecosystem disturbance, impairment, or recovery. Estimating sampling effort needed to adequately represent stream fish assemblages is necessary for informing conservation actions. Increased sampling intensity can increase species detection, affecting the accuracy and precision of biodiversity indices. Seining is commonly used in fish surveys in sand-bottomed streams of the western USA. Here, we sampled 20, 200-m long stream sites each with 40 consecutive seine hauls to determine how increased within-site effort affected measures of species diversity. An average of 10 seine hauls were required to collect 75% of species present at sites in 40 seine hauls, while 18 seine hauls were required to collect 100% of species observed at a site sampled with 40 hauls. Simpson's diversity index was highly variable when fewer than 7 seine hauls were performed at each site but stabilized when effort was > 15 seine hauls per site. Total dissimilarity and beta-diversity components were variable under low sampling effort and also stabilized when effort reached 15 seine hauls per site. However, sampling with more than 18-20 seine hauls per site yielded few additional species. In shallow, sand-bed streams, we suggest sampling with < 5 seine hauls per 200 m of stream can result in unreliable estimates of alpha-diversity and variation in beta-diversity. Increased effort of 15-20 seine hauls per 200 m of stream captured nearly all species present in 40 hauls per 200 m and stabilized species evenness and beta-diversity indices.		[Archdeacon, Thomas P.

J	Schaeffer, Romane; Pascolutti, Victoria J.; Jackson, Timothy N. W.; Arbuckle, Kevin								Diversity Begets Diversity When Diet Drives Snake Venom Evolution, but Evenness Rather Than Richness Is What Counts								TOXINS				15	4					251	10.3390/toxins15040251			APR 2023	2023	Snake venoms are primarily used to subjugate prey, and consequently, their evolution has been shown to be predominantly driven by diet-related selection pressure. Venoms tend to be more lethal to prey than non-prey species (except in cases of toxin resistance), prey-specific toxins have been identified, and preliminary work has demonstrated an association between the diversity of diet classes and that of toxicological activities of whole venom. However, venoms are complex mixtures of many toxins, and it remains unclear how toxin diversity is driven by diet. Prey-specific toxins do not encompass the molecular diversity of venoms, and whole venom effects could be driven by one, few, or all components, so the link between diet and venom diversity remains minimally understood. Here, we collated a database of venom composition and diet records and used a combination of phylogenetic comparative methods and two quantitative diversity indices to investigate whether and how diet diversity relates to the toxin diversity of snake venoms. We reveal that venom diversity is negatively related to diet diversity using Shannon's index but positively related using Simpson's index. Since Shannon's index predominantly considers the number of prey/toxins, whereas Simpson's index more strongly reflects evenness, we provide insights into how the diet-venom diversity link is driven. Specifically, species with low diet diversity tend to have venoms dominated by a few abundant (possibly specialised) toxin families, whereas species with diverse diets tend to 'hedge their bets' by having venoms with a more even composition of different toxin classes.

Water hyacinth is a typical example of inland species, an invasive aquatic plant that can drastically alter the natural plant community's floral diversity. The present study aims to assess the impact of water hyacinth biomass on the floristic characteristics of aquatic plants in the Merbil wetland of the Brahmaputra floodplain, NE, India. Using a systematic sampling technique, data were collected from the field at regular intervals for one year (2021) to estimate monthly water hyacinth biomass. The total estimate of the wetland's biomass was made using the Kriging interpolation technique. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), Simpson's diversity index (D), dominance and evenness or equitability index (E), density, and frequency were used to estimate the floristic characteristics of aquatic plants in the wetland. The result shows that the highest biomass was recorded in September (408.1 tons/ha), while the lowest was recorded in March (38 tons/ha). The floristic composition of aquatic plants was significantly influenced by water hyacinth biomass. A total of forty-one plant species from 23 different families were found in this tiny freshwater marsh during the floristic survey. Out of the total, 25 species were emergent, 11 were floating leaves, and the remaining five were free-floating habitats. Eichhornia crassipes was the wetland's most dominant plant. A negative correlation was observed between water hyacinth biomass and the Shannon (H) index, Simpson diversity index, and evenness. We observed that water hyacinths had changed the plant community structure of freshwater habitats in the study area. Water hyacinth's rapid expansion blocked out sunlight, reducing the ecosystem's productivity and ultimately leading to species loss. The study will help devise plans for the sustainable management of natural resources and provide helpful guidance for maintaining the short-to the medium-term ecological balance in similar wetlands.

Ensemble Machine Learning for Mapping Tree Species Alpha-Diversity Using Multi-Source Satellite Data in an Ecuadorian Seasonally Dry Forest								REMOTE SENSING				15	3					583	10.3390/rs15030583			FEB 2023	2023	The increased variety of satellite remote sensing platforms creates opportunities for estimating tropical forest diversity needed for environmental decision-making. As little as 10% of the original seasonally dry tropical forest (SDTF) remains for Ecuador, Peru, and Colombia. Remnant forests show high rates of species endemism, but experience degradation from climate change, wood-cutting, and livestock-grazing. Forest census data provide a vital resource for examining remote sensing methods to estimate diversity levels. We used spatially referenced trees >= 5 cm in diameter and simulated 0.10 ha plots measured from a 9 ha SDTF in southwestern Ecuador to compare machine learning (ML) models for six alpha-diversity indices. We developed 1 m tree canopy height and elevation models from stem mapped trees, at a scale conventionally derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR). We then used an ensemble ML approach comparing single-and combined-sensor models from RapidEye, Sentinel-2 and interpolated canopy height and topography surfaces. Validation data showed that combined models often outperformed single-sensor approaches. Combined sensor and model ensembles for tree species richness, Shannon's H, inverse Simpson's, unbiased Simpson's, and Fisher's alpha indices typically showed lower root mean squared error (RMSE) and increased goodness of fit (R-2). Pielou's J, a measure of evenness, was poorly predicted. Mapped tree species richness (R2 = 0.54, F = 27.3, p = < 0.001) and Shannon's H' (R-2 = 0.54, F = 26.9, p = < 0.001) showed the most favorable agreement with field validation observations (n = 25). Small-scale model experiments revealed essential relationships between dry forest tree diversity and data from multiple satellite sensors with repeated global coverage that can help guide larger-scale biodiversity mapping efforts.

This study investigated the genetic diversity of 32 Cyclamen genotypes comprising 16 C. persicum varieties and 16 Cyclamen species using multivariate analysis for 36 morphological traits (19 quantitative and 17 qualitative) and molecular characterization (SRAP and SCoT markers). The color CIELab parameters were collected via PCE-CSM7 that separately measured the leaves dark and silvery patterns and the flower's slip (region of the petal top), eye (the region of the petal base) and sepal. Genetic diversity was also evaluated using Shannon Wiener (H ') and Simpson's (lambda) Indices, and Pilou evenness (J) using the library vegan from R software. According to the principal component analysis, the variables that contributed the most were leaf pattern color, leaf abaxial surface color, pedicel coiling, leaf and stem number. The color indicators of Cyclamen leaves showed decreased L* values in darker colored genotypes, whereas increased a* values were noticed in flower eye and lower in slip. Molecular characterization was based on 26 SRAP and 12 SCoT markers that produced clearly repeatable DNA bands and exhibited significant levels of polymorphism. Based on the morphological traits and molecular markers data, the UPGMA method for hierarchical clustering technique was used to generate the dendrograms, and their entanglement was obtained using the Tanglegram algorithm from the dendextend package with the R software. Entanglement analysis (0.30) between dendrograms obtained from the morphological and genetic analysis using SRAP markers showed a high association. Comparison between color measurements of flowers (entanglement=0.45) and leaves (entanglement=0.47) with SCoT analysis revealed differences at species level, discriminating between similar genotypes. Combined phenotypic and molecular analysis improved the comprehensive estimation of real diversity in the investigated Cyclamen genotypes. The findings of the present study are useful for quantifying diversity and genetic variability in Cyclamen breeding and genetic investigations.

This study analyses data from a 40-year experiment established at two sites in the Czech Republic in 1972. The impact of herbicide strategies on the weed communities was evaluated in multi-crop rotation (MCR) with 50% cereals, and simple crop rotations (SCR) with 75% cereals. The following two herbicide strategies were compared: (1) simple treatment with synthetic auxins only in the simple crop rotation, and (2) targeted herbicide combinations with particular use of sulfonylureas, triazines, ureas and synthetic auxins. Untreated plots were included for reference purposes. Results showed that crop was the major factor determining weed community composition and explained 18% of the total variation in the case of untreated controls. However, herbicide treatment reduced the crop effect to 11%. The highest average increase of Shannon's diversity index was by 25.4% after 44 years at the untreated plots in SCR, and it decreased by 15.1% at the treated plots in MCR. Weed species evenness euro increased at all plots by an average of 23%. Simpson's dominance index decreased at untreated plots in both crop rotations and plots treated with auxins, with the highest 44.8% decrease at the untreated plots in SCR. On the contrary, Simpson's index increased by 33,3% on the treated plots in MCR. Herbicide selection depended on the occurrence and density of target weed species, and led to greater decrease in weed diversity and population densities in the diversified crop rotations.

We evaluated the composition of littoral macrobenthos and how it is affected by the physicochemical conditions of the water in El Pane reservoir (Peru), located at 4,550 m.a.s.l. Samples were taken between November 2017 and October 2018 from three zones in the reservoir: low (downstream), middle and high (upstream); two of these zones with fish farms (low and middle) and one zone without fish farms (high). The following physicochemical parameters of the water were measured: dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and temperature. The macrobenthic community was analysed through diversity indices such as Shannon-Wiener (H'), Simpson's dominance index (D), Pielou's evenness (J'), true diversity (D-1), and richness (S). The influence of the physicochemical variables on the macrobenthos was estimated by canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Dissolved oxygen was found to have lower values (<0.5 mg/l) than specified in the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS). Macroinvertebrate richness for the whole reservoir was 17 families, and the family with highest relative abundance was Chironomidae (42.24% in the low zone, 51% in the middle zone and 40.43% in the high zone). The indices showed greater species richness in the high zone, where there are no fish farms. Dissolved oxygen and conductivity were the main factors determining macrobenthos distribution and composition.

The main objective of this study was to determine the biodiversity of phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psy-chodidae, Phlebotominae) in Khuzestan and Kermanshah Provinces of Iran.Methods: Sampling was conducted in Khuzestan and Kermanshah Provinces using sticky paper traps and CDC light traps. The samples were then stored in 96% alcohol-containing vials, mounted, and identified. Afterward, the alpha di-versity (using Simpson's, Shannon-Weiner's diversity, evenness, Maghalef's, Menhinick's, Hill and indices) and beta diversity indices (using Sorensen's and Jaccard's coefficients) were calculated.Results: A total of 4302 sand flies were caught and identified which comprised mostly of Phlebotomus papatasi, Ph. alexandri and Ph. sergenti. It was found that among the four counties of Ahvaz, Shush, Shushtar and Dezful in Khuzestan Province, Shush had the lowest, and Shushtar, the highest amount of species diversity and evenness. In the four studied counties of Kermanshah Province, species diversity in Kermanshah County had the lowest amount and Sarpol-e-Zahab, the highest. The species richness in Kermanshah County was the lowest, while Qasr-e-Shirin County had the highest amount.Conclusion: An overview of the biodiversity of phlebotomine sand flies in Kermanshah County in Kermanshah Prov-ince, and Shush County in Khuzestan Province, showed less stability in community structure of these vectors, which can be counted as an alarm for emerging dominant vectors among the studied counties and have the potential to increase the prevalence of leishmaniasis.

The study is based on the data of bottom trawl surveys conducted by the Pacific Research Institute of Fisheries and Oceanography (TINRO) in 1977-2010. The inverse Simpson's index (or polydominance index) is selected as a measure of dominance; the Sorensen-Czekanowski similarity index is used for comparative analysis of the dominance structure in ichthyocenes of the regions. The analysis of the importance of species in the ichthyocene species structure is carried out for the top 20 species ranked by biomass. These species constitute a substantial portion of the biomass of all demersal fishes in all the regions: an average of 94.9% for the shelf and 95.8% for the continental slope. A conclusion is made that the ichthyocenes of bottom and near-bottom biotopes (0-2000 m) in Russian waters of the Far Eastern Seas are represented by communities with poor evenness in species abundance and a pronounced dominance of two to four species. The importance of species in the ichthyocene structure is as follows: walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) dominates all the regions; the subdominants are Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii), Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus), Atka mackerel (Pleurogrammus monopterygius), and Okhotsk atka mackerel (P. azonus), depending on the region. The ubiquitous dominance of walleye pollock is broken on the continental slope of the Bering Sea dominated by the giant grenadier (Albatrossia pectoralis); the group of subdominants on the continental slope of all regions is comprised of Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides matsuurae), popeye grenadier (Coryphaenoides cinereus), Pacific herring, Pacific sleeper shark (Somniosus pacificus), scale-eye plaice (Acanthopsetta nadeshnyi), and blackfin founder (Glyptocephalus stelleri). The graphs of similarity between the study regions (Sea of Okhotsk, Bering Sea, Sea of Japan, and Pacific waters off Kamchatka and the Kuril Islands) in species composition and dominant species structure of ichthyocenes are composed separately for the shelf and continental slope using summarized data.

Experimental warming increases fungal alpha diversity in an oligotrophic maritime Antarctic soil								FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY				13						1050372	10.3389/fmicb.2022.1050372			NOV 10 2022	2022	The climate of maritime Antarctica has altered since the 1950s. However, the effects of increased temperature, precipitation and organic carbon and nitrogen availability on the fungal communities inhabiting the barren and oligotrophic fellfield soils that are widespread across the region are poorly understood. Here, we test how warming with open top chambers (OTCs), irrigation and the organic substrates glucose, glycine and tryptone soy broth (TSB) influence a fungal community inhabiting an oligotrophic maritime Antarctic fellfield soil. In contrast with studies in vegetated soils at lower latitudes, OTCs increased fungal community alpha diversity (Simpson's index and evenness) by 102-142% in unamended soil after 5 years. Conversely, OTCs had few effects on diversity in substrate-amended soils, with their only main effects, in glycine-amended soils, being attributable to an abundance of Pseudogymnoascus. The substrates reduced alpha and beta diversity metrics by 18-63%, altered community composition and elevated soil fungal DNA concentrations by 1-2 orders of magnitude after 5 years. In glycine-amended soil, OTCs decreased DNA concentrations by 57% and increased the relative abundance of the yeast Vishniacozyma by 45-fold. The relative abundance of the yeast Gelidatrema declined by 78% in chambered soil and increased by 1.9-fold in irrigated soil. Fungal DNA concentrations were also halved by irrigation in TSB-amended soils. In support of regional- and continental-scale studies across climatic gradients, the observations indicate that soil fungal alpha diversity in maritime Antarctica will increase as the region warms, but suggest that the accumulation of organic carbon and nitrogen compounds in fellfield soils arising from expanding plant populations are likely, in time, to attenuate the positive effects of warming on diversity.

Investigating Unused Tools for the Animal Behavioral Diversity Toolkit								ANIMALS				12	21					2984	10.3390/ani12212984			NOV 2022	2022	Simple Summary Behavioral diversity is sometimes used by animal scientists to better understand and compare how animals behave. The methods used in behavioral diversity research have not been investigated across the entire research sector. This paper aims to identify which methods are being used in behavioral diversity research and find some novel methods from other areas of science that could be used in new research. To investigate the techniques and species investigated in behavioral diversity literature, a literature search was conducted. Two methods: behavioral richness and the Shannon-Wiener index, were the most often used methods, whereas the Behavioral Variability index featured rarely. While a range of species appeared in the behavioral literature, mammals were the most frequently studied animal group, whereas amphibians did not feature in any papers. There are several diversity indices which did not feature in behavioral diversity including Simpson's index, and Chao. These methods could be used to better understand animal behavioral study outputs or be used to estimate the number of 'unobserved' behaviors that an animal may express. Future studies could therefore make use of these unused tools. Behavioral diversity is a commonly used tool used to quantify the richness and evenness of animal behaviors and assess the effect of variables that may impact an animal's quality of life. The indices used in behavioral diversity research, and the study subjects, have not been formally reviewed. This paper aims to identify which indices are being used in behavioral diversity research, and under which scenarios, and uncover novel indices from other disciplines that could be applied to behavioral diversity. To investigate the techniques and species investigated in behavioral diversity literature, a Web of Science literature search was conducted. Two methods: behavioral richness and the Shannon-Wiener index, were the most frequently used indices, whereas the Behavioral Variability index featured rarely. While a range of species appeared in the behavioral literature, mammals were the most frequently studied Class, whereas amphibians did not feature in any papers. There are several diversity indices which did not feature in behavioral diversity including Simpson's index, and Chao. Such indices could be used to better understand animal behavioral study outputs or be used to estimate the number of 'unobserved' behaviors that an animal may express. Future studies could therefore extend beyond the Shannon-Wiener and richness indices.

Before commercialization, it is necessary to assess possible ecological impacts, including impacts on non-target arthropods (NTAs) in the field. In the present study, transgenic Bt maize expressing cry1Ab/2Aj and its corresponding non-transformed near isoline were planted under the same environmental and agricultural conditions, and arthropods in the field were collected during the three main growth stages of maize. In a one year trial, the results showed the composition of NTA communities in the transgenic and control maize fields were similar. There were no significant differences for community-level parameters of species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), evenness index (J) and Simpson's dominant concentration (C) between the two types of maize fields. Likewise, a Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and distance analysis showed that Cry1Ab/2Aj toxin exposure did not increase community dissimilarities between Bt and non-Bt maize plots and that the structure of the NTAs community was similar on the two maize varieties. Furthermore, planting of the transgenic cry1Ab/2Aj maize did not affect the density or composition of non-target decomposers, herbivores, predators, parasitoids and pollinator guilds. In summary, our results showed that planting of Bt maize producing Cry1Ab/Cry2Aj proteins do not adversely affect population dynamics and diversity of NTAs.

J	Portero, Rodrigo; Cueto, Marian; Fernandez-Gomez, Maria J.; Alvarez-Fernandez, Esteban								Surf and turf. Animal resources in the human diet in Cantabrian Spain during the Mesolithic (11.5-7.5 Ky cal. BP)								JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS				45						103635	10.1016/j.jasrep.2022.103635			OCT 2022	2022	The beginning of the Holocene involved a series of climatic and environmental changes that affected the ways of life of the last hunter-gatherers. In the case of the Spanish Cantabrian region, these changes transformed the material culture and the way human groups interacted with the environment and, therefore, the subsistence strategies of the end of the Upper Pleistocene. In terms of the use of faunal resources, this period was charac-terised by an increase in the exploitation of coastal resources, mainly molluscs, but also crustaceans and echi-noderms, which make up the so-called "shell middens", while at the same time the percentage of macromammals was reduced and animals considered to have a "low energy range" were introduced into the diet. In this paper we assess the role played by each of these animal resources in the subsistence of Mesolithic human groups, deter-mining their nutritional contribution and establishing a prey ranking based on the caloric intake of each resource. For this purpose, we collected archaeofaunal data from 14 sites from recent archaeological excavations with levels dated between ca. 11.5 and 7.5 ky cal BP in which the consumption of vertebrates and invertebrates is documented. At each of these sites we analysed diversity, homogeneity and species richness using Simpson's and Shannon's indexes, as well as the effective numbers of species for terrestrial and coastal resources, assessing the relationship between the two. With the palaeoecological and palaeoeconomic data from these archaeological sites (most of them located in caves), we estimate the weight that the different animal resources consumed by the last hunter-gatherer communities of the Cantabrian region had in their diet.

The study goal was to use quantitative ecological approaches to determine the species richness and diversity of wild flora and the ultimate impact of environmental factors on vegetation dynamics. MethodsQuadrats having sizes of 1x1 for herbs, 5x5 for shrubs, and 10x10 m(2) for trees were used. Various phytosociological characteristics were investigated in association with a wide variety of environmental variables. Soil analysis based on texture, moisture, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic matter (OM), available potassium (K), and phosphorus (P) were examined. The existing state of vegetation along the River Chenab was assessed using SWOT analysis and a future conservation strategy was devised. ResultsOne hundred twenty different plant speies were divided into 51 families including 92 dicots, 17 monocots, 6 pteridophytes and 1 bryophyte species. Herbs accounted for 89 followed by shrubs (16 species) and trees (15 species). Correlation analysis revealed a highly positive correlation between relative density and relative frequency (0.956**). Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices elaborated that site 3 and 7 with clay loamy soil had non-significant alpha diversity and varies from site to site. Diversity analysis showed that site 10 was most diverse (22.25) in terms of species richness. The principal coordinate analysis expressed that different environmental variables including OM, soil pH, P, K, and EC affect vegetation significantly, therefore, loamy soil showed presence and dispersal of more vegetation as compared to loam, sandy and sandy loam soils. Further, 170 ppm of available potassium had significant affect on plant diversity and distribution. ConclusionAsteraceae family was found dominant as dicot while poaceae among monocot. Adhatoda vasica was one of the unique species and found in Head Maralla site. For evenness, site 3 had maximum value 0.971. Most of the soil represented loamy soil texture where site 2 and 4 possess high soil moisture content. SWOT analysis revealed strengths as people prefered plants for medicine, food and economic purposes. In weakness, agricultural practices, soil erosion and flooding affected the vegetation. In opportunities, Forest and Irrigation Departments were planting plants for the restoration of ecosystem. Threats include anthropogenic activities overgrazing, urbanization and road infrastructure at Head Maralla, habitat fragmentation at Head Khanki, and extensive fish farming at Head Qadirabad. Future conservation efforts should be concentrated on SWOT analysis outcome in terms of stopping illegal consumption of natural resources, restoration of plant biodiversity through reforestation, designating protected areas and multiplying rare species locally.

This pest is described as invasive, especially in the current climate change dispensation. It is important to investigate the population dynamics of C. partellus for better management practices. We studied the species abundance distribution (SAD) models and some biodiversity indices of three major stem bores, C. partellus, Ostrinia nubilalis and Sesamia nonagrioides as these are the most common and major stem borers of maize in the Mediterranean Region. With the help of light traps, weekly catches of the three major maize stem borers were collected during two maize growing seasons (first cropping and second cropping seasons) in 2018 and 2019. The results showed that C. partellus emerged earlier (April-May) and was very dominant throughout the first cropping season of maize. Ostrinia nubilalis and S. nonagrioides emerged late in June-July, and its population remained low throughout the first cropping season. The population structure of all three stem borers was similar throughout the second cropping season of maize. The relative abundance (RA) of C. partellus was significantly higher than that of O. nubilalis and S. nonagrioides in the first cropping (p <.0001) when compared to the second cropping season (p >.05) for both years. In the first cropping season for both years, no SAD model fitted the observed species distribution, although Fisher's log series was relatively similar. In the second cropping for both years, the geometric series distribution model fitted the observed SAD. The Berger-Parker dominance index was greater for the first cropping season than that of the second, whereas the opposite was true for the Simpson's evenness and evenness of Pielou. High RA of C. partellus and the geometric series distribution observed in the second cropping are indicative of a possible dominant status of the C. partellus in the Mediterranean Region of Turkey. Our findings indicated that seasonality is a fundamental driving factor influencing the distribution of the three major stem borers of maize in the Mediterranean Region. In addition, the long and warmer winters could be the reason for the dominance of C. partellus as indicated by the diversity indices.

Spatial Variation in the Composition and Diversity of Fishes Inhabiting an Artificial Water Supply Lake, Eastern China								FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				10						921082	10.3389/fevo.2022.921082			AUG 4 2022	2022	With the intensification of eutrophication, many artificial water supply lakes that act as a biological filter for water diverted from rivers have been built to alleviate water scarcity in Eastern China. In this study, we selected Lake Yanlong, a representative artificial water supply lake in Yancheng City, as our experimental lake to explore how the community composition of fishes changed among different habitat types and assess potential consequences for effective water treatment. From October 2015 to October 2020, we conducted quarterly surveys of fish communities and environmental factors in the Mangshe River (MR; water for lake) compared to four different water treatment zones of Lake Yanlong (PZ, the pretreatment zone with inlet from the MR; EZ, the emergent macrophyte zone; SZ, the submerged macrophyte zone; DZ, the deep purification zone with outlet to urban waterworks). A total of 16,339 individual fish belonging to 11 families and 49 species were collected. Six of the eight dominant species observed across zones were small-bodied fishes. Despite reduced fish species richness, the relative abundance and biomass of fishes tended to be higher in Lake Yanlong relative to the MR. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou evenness index, Simpson's diversity index all decreased from the MR to the DZ in the following sequence: MR < PZ < EZ < SZ < DZ. Analysis of similarities and similarity percentage analysis confirmed that fish communities differed significantly among zones and Coilia ectenes, Carassius auratus, Pseudobrama simony, Hemiculter leucisculus, and Hemiculter bleekeri were the major differentiating species. Mantel's test and redundancy analysis revealed that water depth, aquatic vegetation coverage, and phytoplankton concentrations were the major factors determining the spatial distribution of fishes when moving from the MR to the DZ of Lake Yanlong. Stocking piscivorous fish can be used as an effective measure to control the abundance of prolific small-bodied fishes in Lake Yanlong. The details backing these findings are important for understanding how the community composition of fishes among habitat types in Lake Yanlong influence water quality, and to develop suitable biomanipulation strategies for the management of fish resources and maintaining proper function of these artificial water supply lakes.

J	Fogarty, Frank A.; Yen, Jian D. L.; Fleishman, Erica; Sollmann, Rahel; Ke, Alison								Multiple-region, N-mixture community model to assess associations of riparian area, fragmentation, and species richness								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				32	8					e2698	10.1002/eap.2698			DEC 2022	2022	The associations of habitat area and fragmentation with species richness long have been major topics within community ecology. Recent discussion has focused on properly assessing fragmentation independent of habitat area (fragmentation per se), and on whether fragmentation has significant negative or positive associations with species richness. We created a novel, multiple-region, N-mixture community model (MNCM) to examine the relations of riparian area and fragmentation with species richness of breeding birds in mountain ranges within the Great Basin, Nevada, USA. Our MNCM accounts for imperfect detection in count data at the survey-point level while allowing comparisons of species richness among regions in which those points are embedded. We used individual canyons within mountain ranges as regions in our model and measured riparian area and the Normalized Landscape Shape Index, a metric of fragmentation that is independent of total riparian area. We found that riparian area, but not its fragmentation, was a primary predictor of canyon-level species richness of both riparian obligates and all species. The relationship between riparian area and riparian obligate species richness was nonlinear: canyons with >= 25 ha woody riparian vegetation had relatively high species richness, whereas species richness was considerably lower in canyons with <25 ha. Our MNCM can be used to calculate other metrics of diversity that require abundance estimates. For example, Simpson's evenness of riparian obligate species had a weak negative association with riparian area and was not associated with fragmentation. Projections of future riparian contraction suggested that decreases in species richness are likely to be greatest in canyons that currently have moderate (similar to 10-25 ha) amounts of riparian vegetation. Our results suggest that if a goal of management is to maximize the species richness of breeding birds in montane riparian areas in the Great Basin, it may be more effective to focus on total habitat area than on fragmentation of patches within canyons, and that canyons with at least moderate amounts of riparian vegetation should be prioritized.

They are the common environmental indicators in agricultural landscape. Therefore, this study took Gongyi City, Henan Province, China, located in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River, as the study area, to explore the impact of multi-scale landscape heterogeneity on soil fauna diversity and the response of soil fauna to it. Our results showed that patch types and degree of fragmentation in the study area increased significantly with the increase of spatial scale. The diversity indices of soil fauna in different habitats showed that the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson's diversity index, Pielou's evenness index, and Margalef richness index were the lowest in farmland habitat. Diversity indices of artificial forests were higher than those of natural forests. Diversity indices of soil fauna under different geomorphic conditions showed that Pielou's evenness index and Margalef richness index had significant differences under different geomorphic conditions (p < 0.05). The effects of multi-scale landscape heterogeneity on soil fauna diversity were different. In the 150 m buffer zone, soil fauna community composition and diversity indices were strongly correlated with patch richness index, patch richness density, and other landscape indices (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the contribution rate of landscape index to soil fauna community composition were 45.05%, 32.5%, and 42% in farmland, plantation, and natural forest, respectively. Therefore, the 150 m buffer zone could be used as the characteristic response scale of soil fauna diversity. The multi-scale interaction of landform, habitat, and landscape also had a significant impact on soil fauna diversity.

There were 81 fish species found, classified into 13 orders, 40 families, and 69 genera. The most dominant order was Perciformes (55.42 %), followed by Clupeiformes (20.44 %), Cypriniformes (8.96 %), Siluriformes (8.13 %), and others (7.05%). To illustrate the species diversity, fish species richness and evenness in sampling areas, indices of fish community viz. Shannon-Wiener's Index (H), Simpson's Dominance Index (D), Simpson's Diversity Index (1-D), Margalef's Index (d) and Gibson's Evenness (euro) were used and 3.29-3.48, 0.05-0.069, 0.93-0.95, 6.88-8.43 and 0.39-0.49 respectively were the overall values of the indices. S1 station is significantly differ in species richness from the rest of the five stations (P < 0.05). The analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) displayed significant (P-value < 0.05) variations in fish community among sta-tions and months. In compliance with similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis, 35.8% similarities were observed among the fish species from different stations, while 59.36% similarities were detected among the fish species from different months. One species is critically endangered (CR), three species are nearly threatened, eight species are endangered (EN), and eight species are vulnerable among the 81 fish species recorded at various sampling locations. The socioeconomic conditions of fishermen were determined on the basis of a personal interview and focus group discussion. Unfair fishing practices as well as environmental instabilities such as reduced water volume, increased sedimentation, water abstraction, and pollution have ravaged fish habitat and diminished fish diversity over time. As a result, fish preservation in the Andharmanik River has become imperative, and an in-tegrated management plan should be designed and executed as soon as possible.

J	Abu Seri, Nurhafizul; Abd Rahman, Azimah								The Compilation Records of Fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) Diversity and Distribution and Display Trees Throughout Malaysia								PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				30	3			1963	1987		10.47836/pjst.30.3.11			JUL 2022	2022	The populations of fireflies (Coleoptera: Lampyridae) are increasingly being threatened, and it is, thus, a significant problem in Southeast Asia, particularly Malaysia. Fireflies and their habitat must immediately be protected before they go extinct. Simpson's Diversity Index used in this paper review to measure the diversity of firefly species across Malaysia. The Simpson's Diversity Index showed that the richness and evenness of firefly species in Malaysia is infinite diversity with D = 0.2255. The authors compiled and reviewed the studies on the firefly species to incorporate available information/data and emphasised their preferred habitat/display trees in response to the issue. Therefore, this paper was also able to track down records of fireflies' species' distribution through the previous studies in eight states in West Malaysia (Peninsula), namely Johor, Kelantan, Kuala Lumpur, Pahang, Perak, Negeri Sembilan, Selangor, and Terengganu, as well as two states in East Malaysia (Borneo), namely Sabah and Sarawak. It indicates that firefly species, especially from the genera Pteroptyx (Pteroptyx tener species), are widely distributed in Peninsular Malaysia and East Malaysia. Based on the records from the study conducted by previous researchers, it was found that the population of fireflies is declining in some areas in Malaysia, and so are their habitats and host/display trees that have suffered the same decline. Perhaps, this paper will help broaden human beings' geographical understanding/knowledge and create awareness which eventually leads to conservation actions of firefly species and their host/display trees.

J	Tefera, Tsegaye; Ejigu, Dessalegn; Tassie, Nega								Avian diversity and bird-aircraft strike problems in Bahir Dar International Airport, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia								BMC ZOOLOGY				7	1					36	10.1186/s40850-022-00135-8			JUN 28 2022	2022	Background Bahir Dar International Airport and its surrounding habitats are known for their rich avifaunal diversity, which results in bird-aircraft collisions as a fundamental problem in the area. A study on bird diversity and bird-aircraft strikes at Bahir Dar International Airport was conducted between February 2020 and August 2020. Based on its vegetation structures, the study area was classified into four habitat types namely; bushland, grassland, wetland, and modified habitats. Transect and point count methods were used to collect data on avian diversity and abundance. Questionnaire surveys, interviews, and document analysis were used to gather information about incidents and protection measures against bird-aircraft strike problems. Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson's similarity index, ANOVA, and chi-square test were used for data analysis. Results A total of 80 avian species belonging to 15 orders and 40 families were identified in the study area. The highest species diversity (H' = 3.59) and species evenness (E = 0.96) were recorded in modified habitats during the wet season. Relative abundance categories of birds in the study area showed that most were uncommon birds. Birds pose severe threats to aircraft in the airport and 92.3% of the respondents replied that most bird-aircraft strikes occurred early in the morning and late in the afternoon when birds remain more active. The majority (88.5%) of questionnaire participants confirmed that bird-aircraft strike incidents frequently occurred during the time of takeoff and landing of the aircraft. It is also known that on average forty bird-aircraft collisions per year happen at the airport. Conclusion Bahir Dar International Airport is rich in its bird diversity that recalls the aviation authority to work in collaboration with different organizations to avoid bird-aircraft strike problems using different control measures without compromising the conservation of birds.

Macrofungal diversity and distribution in Kishtwar High Altitude National Park, Jammu and Kashmir, India								CURRENT SCIENCE				122	12			1415	1425					JUN 25 2022	2022	The present study was conducted at 10 sites in Kishtwar High Altitude National Park (KHANP), Jammu and Kashmir, India, with the objective to analyse the diversity and distribution of macrofungal communities. A total of 40 permanent plots (four plots in each site) were established and macrofungal fruiting bodies were recorded monthly from each plot between July 2015 and October 2017. Diversity indices and canonical correspondence analysis were applied to determine the composition and environmental factors responsible for structuring the macrofungal communities in the study area. In total, 83 wild macrofungal species were identified belonging to 35 genera, 24 families and 9 orders. Humicolous fungi were the most dominant group of macrofungi contributing 71.8% of the total dominance, followed by lignicolous fungi (11.8%). The distribution of fruiting bodies of macrofungal species was mainly in groups, i.e. aggregated pattern (75.9%). The diversity indices varied from 20 to 37 (richness), 2.04 to 3.16 (Menhinick), 4.14 to 7.25 (Margalef), 0.03 to 0.06 (Simpson's dominance), 2.91 to 3.49 (Shannon-Wiener's diversity), 0.86 to 0.95 (evenness), 7.69 to 16.29 (Fisher's alpha) and 0.05 to 0.12 (Berger-Parker diversity). Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that Scleroderma verrucosum, Boletus granulatus and Ramaria formosa were the most important species, and that mean temperature and rainfall were the key environmental factors responsible for the diversity and distribution of macrofungi in the present study.

J	Haley, Ava Louise; Mueller, Rachel Lockridge								Transposable Element Diversity Remains High in Gigantic Genomes								JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION				90	5			332	341		10.1007/s00239-022-10063-3			OCT 2022	2022	Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive sequences of DNA that replicate and proliferate throughout genomes. Taken together, all the TEs in a genome form a diverse community of sequences, which can be studied to draw conclusions about genome evolution. TE diversity can be measured using models for ecological community diversity that consider species richness and evenness. Several models predict TE diversity decreasing as genomes expand because of selection against ectopic recombination and/or competition among TEs to garner host replicative machinery and evade host silencing mechanisms. Salamanders have some of the largest vertebrate genomes and highest TE loads. Salamanders of the genus Plethodon, in particular, have genomes that range in size from 20 to 70 Gb. Here, we use Oxford Nanopore sequencing to generate low-coverage genomic sequences for four species of Plethodon that encompass two independent genome expansion events, one in the eastern clade (Plethodon cinereus, 29.3 Gb vs. Plethodon glutinosus, 38.9 Gb) and one in the western clade (Plethodon vehiculum, 46.4 Gb vs Plethodon idahoensis, 67.0 Gb). We classified the TEs in these genomes and found > 40 TE superfamilies, accounting for 22-27% of the genomes. We calculated Simpson's and Shannon's diversity indices to quantify overall TE diversity. In both pairwise comparisons, the diversity index values for the smaller and larger genome were almost identical. This result indicates that, when genomes reach extremely large sizes, they maintain high levels of TE diversity at the superfamily level, in contrast to predictions made by previous studies on smaller genomes.

The purpose of this study was to describe the different types of fishing gear that are available with their characteristics, fish species assemblage and to assess the fish diversity status through sampling in five sampling stations during the study period. A total of 16 different types of fishing gears were discovered in the study, which were divided into eight major categories. There were 61 fish species found in total under 9 orders, 26 families and 45 genera. Cypriniformes (48.02%) was found to be the most dominant order, followed by Perciformes (17.07%), Siluriformes (15.96%), Synbranchiformes (9.33%), Clupeiformes (6.28%), and others (3.35%). Indices of Population viz. Shannon-Wiener's Index (H), Simpson's Dominance Index (D), Simpson's Diversity Index (1-D), Margalef's Index (d) and Gibson's Evenness (euro) were used to display species diversity, fish species richness and evenness in sampling areas and the overall values of the indices were 3.36-3.64, 0.033-0.048, 0.952-0.966, 4.74-6.02 and 0.64-0.73 respectively. There was a strong negative correlation between Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Dominance diversity index (r =-0.80936) and a moderate negative correlation between Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Evenness diversity index (r =-0.39911). According to Similarity percentage (SIMPER) analysis 67.29% similarity were found among the stations and 64.71% similarity were observed among the months of fish species. Among 61 fish species of different sampling stations found 5 species are critically endangered (CR), 11 species are endangered (EN) and 12 species are vulnerable according to IUCN red list (2015).

J	Souahi, Hana; Gacem, Rania; Chenchouni, Haroun								Variation in Plant Diversity along a Watershed in the Semi-Arid Lands of North Africa								DIVERSITY-BASEL				14	6					450	10.3390/d14060450			JUN 2022	2022	Plants are a vital part of the world's biological diversity and have great economic and cultural importance. Plant biodiversity balances ecosystems, protects watersheds, mitigates erosion, affects climate, and provides shelter for many animal species. This study aimed to determine plant diversity in relation to the soil properties of semi-arid rangelands along a gradient at the watershed scale in the Oued Chabro, Algeria. Plants and soil were sampled at 27 points distributed in three sampling sites (upstream, midstream, and downstream). The floristic data was analyzed using species richness estimators, life forms, spatial occurrence, and multiple factor analysis. Moreover, the effects of soil properties on the taxonomic structure of plant communities in the sampling sites were analyzed using Pearson correlations. The characterized flora included 42 plant species classified into 18 families, and Asteraceae (38.1%), Poaceae (14.3%), Brassicaceae (7.1%), Amaranthaceae (4.8%), and Chenopodiaceae (4.8%) were the most representative in terms of species. The species Atractylis delicatula was dominant (relative abundance = 81.5%). The upstream site was characterized by a high vegetation cover, high species abundances, and richness in plant families and genera. Significant correlations were observed in this area between the number of genera, number of families, number of species, family richness, Pielou evenness index, and Simpson's concentration index. The upstream site was characterized by chamaephytes and phanerophytes; 16 species were exclusively present in this section. Two species were found in the midstream site and one (Scolymus hispanicus) was found in downstream site. The upstream site was positively correlated with plant litter, the midstream with barren soil, and the downstream study area was negatively correlated with coarse-grained materials and vegetation cover. This study demonstrated that differences in life forms, richness, and diversity exist among the three sampling sites due to the soil differences and the positions along the watershed.

A general trend towards an increase in the species diversity from the northern part of Morocco to the area of Mauritania has been revealed (the average values of the Margalef index increase from 4.63 to 7.02). The ichthyoplankton assemblages of the study areas are characterized by a medium and high biotic diversity (Simpson's index 0.22-0.90); different degrees of their monodominance are observed more often (in 25 of the 44 observations, Pielou's evenness index was less than 0.5) than the relatively equal abundance of all species. In the northern part of Morocco, similar trends have been revealed in the dynamics of diversity indices and abundance indices for European pilchard Sardina pilchardus at its early development stages; in the southern part of Morocco and in Mauritania, the trends in the diversity and abundance dynamics are similar in round sardinella Sardinella aurita. In the ichthyoplankton of the study areas, the dominant species is S. pilchardus and subdominant species are S. aurita, European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, and sparids (Sparidae).		[Arkhipov, A.

Although once a common steppe species, marmots are now endangered due to overharvesting, which has led to concerns over the impacts of their loss on other species. The decline of marmots likely affected other species given their importance to the ecosystems they inhabit. To examine the role of marmots on small mammal, we established Sherman traps and drift fence arrays with associated pitfall and funnel traps on active marmot colonies, inactive colonies, and control sites in the forest-steppe and semi-desert zones of Mongolia. Overall, we identified 385 individuals representing 11 species of rodents and 1 species of bat in Ikh Nart and 149 individuals representing 2 species of rodents and 1 species of insectivore from Hustai. We found mixed results between diversity indices and abundance of small mammals on treatment and control sites, complicating the picture. During periods of greater precipitation and resulting higher vegetation cover, species abundance and the Shannon-Wiener, Simpson???s, and evenness indices all changed significantly, suggesting that the effect of marmots on other species varies based on environmental conditions. ?? 2022 National Science Museum of Korea (NSMK) and Korea National Arboretum (KNA), Publishing Services by Elsevier.

To understand single and combined effects of norfloxacin (0-20 mu g g-1) and copper (40 mu g g-1) on microbial ecology in estuaries, we evaluated changes in bacteria population, inhibition rates, and microbial composition in estuarine sediments over a 28-day period. Bacteria population significantly decreased following single and combined exposure to norfloxacin and copper throughout the incubation period, except on Day 28 in treatments exposed to copper, 20 mu g g-1 norfloxacin, or both. These three treatment groups had lower Shannon diversity and Simpson's indices on Day 28 than other treatments and the controls suggesting recovery in bacteria population did not correspond with recovery in richness and evenness. Furthermore, functional predictions revealed that the effect of time and contaminants were significantly different on some microbial community functions on Day 28, especially the combination of Cu and high concentration NFX, including aerobic chemoheterotrophy, methanol oxidation and methylotrophy. Thus, norfloxacin and copper had significant adverse effects on microbial communities in estuarine sediments; however, the combined effects were variable and depended on exposure duration and antibiotic concentration.

Following extensive repeated sampling in three regions of Poland, we found 318 fungal species from different trophic groups. The two forest management strategies showed similar cumulative fungal species richness and values for Shannon, evenness, and Simpson's dominance indices, suggesting that both management strategies did not generate factors stimulating or limiting species richness and biodiversity. In contrast, site as well as forest management strategy affected the composition of all fungal trophic groups, with site being a stronger influencing factor. Different fungal ecological groups responded differently to environmental drivers, with ectomycorrhizal symbionts and parasites being more tightly linked to tree traits than saprotrophs, which were affected mostly by climate and substrate. Indicator species associated mainly with managed forests comprised predominantly wood-inhabiting fungi. Conservation-relevant species (red-listed in Poland) were noted in both forest reserves and managed forests; however, they predominated in the former. The results indicated a rather slow process of transformation of fungal communities in forest reserves originating from previously managed forests. The major conclusion of this study is that managed forests complement forest reserves in fungal diversity conservation.

The present study makes an attempt to identify the concentration of species among tree diversity in Mahavir Swami Wildlife Sanctuary, Bundelkhand, India. Four important ecological indicator indices namely Shannon-Weiner index (H'), Simpson's diversity (D), Margalef index (SR) and Pielou's (J) indices were make the most for species diversity measurement. The research outcomes revealed that Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H/) was found to be the best index for assessing species richness while Simpson's diversity (D) index was more suited for determining species diversity. The Shannon-Weiner index value calculated for different transects not only represent the species richness but also the species evenness in each transect. The potential application of forest diversity can be used a mechanism for forest management. The methodology will retrofit better policy implementation for maintaining the health of forest species in Mahavir Swami Wildlife Sanctuary and can be applied on other reserve forest of socio-ecological significance.

A better understanding of P. palmivora population genetics is needed to aid the development of relevant disease management strategies. This study is the first population genetic study of P. palmivora in Indonesia using microsatellite markers based on the alleles genotyping method. The microsatellite markers were used to determine the genotype of 44 P. palmivora isolates from Sulawesi (24) and Java (20) islands. The total number of observed multilocus genotypes (MLG) from both populations was 34. The genotypic diversity of P. palmivora from Sulawesi (2.90; 16.0; 0.938) and Java (2.76; 14.3; 0.930) islands was high as seen from Shannon's diversity index (H), Stoddart and Taylor's Index (G), and Simpson's Index (l) respectively. Evenness and Nei's unbiased gene diversity exhibited similarly high levels from both populations. The linkage disequilibrium test indicated that sexual recombination occurred in the Java population (P = 0.312). Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) and Bayesian clustering revealed five genetic clusters, and isolates from both islands were evenly distributed across the five gene clusters. All genetic diversity was from within individuals. P. palmivora from Sulawesi and Java showed a high genotypic diversity but a lack of genetic differentiation among populations (Fst = 0.006). Both populations formed one highly diverse group. Minimum spanning network analysis showed no particular grouping of MLGs, and shared MLGs from both populations indicated long-distance migration of P. palmivora facilitated by human activities.(c) 2022 British Mycological Society.

Typology of Pure Deodar Forests Driven by Vegetation-Environment Relations in Manoor Valley, Northwestern Himalaya								APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL				12	5					2753	10.3390/app12052753			MAR 2022	2022	The current research was carried out to characterize the phytosociology of the forests of one of Pakistan's most valuable tree species (Deodar) across its native range. In this context, our main hypothesis was that, along the altitudinal gradient, we would find different plant communities that would be driven by different environmental variables (climatic, edaphic, and physiographic). Therefore, to assess the vegetation structure of the pure Deodar forests of the unexplored Manoor Valley (Northwestern Himalaya), Pakistan, frequent field visits were carried out during different seasons of 2015-2018. Ecological methods: Line transects sampling (23 stands) and phytosociological attributes were evaluated in relation to geographical and environmental variables. Various statistical software applications (i.e., PCORD, RStudio 4.0, and R 3.6.1) were used to examine all of the gathered data of plant species and environmental variables. A total of three different plant communities (Cedrus-Isodon-Cynodon, Cedrus-Cynodon-Dryopteris, and Sambucus-Cedrus-Desmodium) were identified by grouping 162 species and 23 stands in pure Deodar forests under the influence of geographic, slope, edaphic, and climatic variables, ranging from 1580.8 to 2373.8 m. The altitude (1936-2373 m), slope angle (25-85 degrees), sandy (29-48%) and loamy soil texture, wind speed (1.45 ms(-1)), and temperature (25.8 degrees C) all had a strong influence on the Sambucus-Cedrus-Desmodium community. In contrast with this, the Cedrus-Cynodon-Dryopteris community showed a positively significant relationship with the northeastern slope, silty (32-58%) and sandy (15.8-55%) loamy soil texture, and barometric pressure (814.3 pa). Nonetheless, the Cedrus-Isodon-Cynodon community revealed a significant positive association with the northeastern to southwestern slope, pH (6.3), wet bulb (19.7), and dew point (17.7). We found significant differences (p < 0.001) among the three communities found in the pure Deodar forests in the four diversity indexes. The Sambucus-Cedrus-Desmodium community has the maximum number of plants (129 species), Shannon's diversity (H' = 3.7), and Simpson's dominance (0.98) values among the recorded communities. The Pielou's evenness index value was led by the Cedrus-Isodon-Cynodon community (0.97). Beta diversity showed a dissimilarity lower than 50% among the three communities. Simple term effects in the canonical correspondence analysis model revealed significant (p < 0.05) differences in altitude, slope angle, slope (southeastern), and wind speed variables. The present investigation sheds light on vegetation pattern and species contribution as a function of environmental gradients and provides a baseline for future studies.

Most studies have emphasized on the bacterial microbiome of plants, yet mycobiome is new in this area. The aim of this work is to perform metagenomic analysis of mycobiota associated with hypocotyls of Capsicum sp. infected by Phytophthora capsici to provide better insights in understanding the pathogenicity and disease control in Capsicum sp.-P. capsici system. Internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region was used for the identification of fungi species in the metagenomic study. Monozoosporic strains of P. capsici was used to infect different Capsicum spp. (Marcato, ECU-9129, Nathalie and ECU-12831 genotypes) that were available locally in Ecuador. According to the symptoms and the hypocotyls' colonization by P. capsici in Capsicum genotypes, these were classified among resistant (ECU-9129, ECU-12831 and Nathalie) and susceptible (Marcato). Regarding the analysis, values of Shannon's diversity index, Simpson's Dominance index, and evenness were found to be 1.82-1.92, 0.75-0.77, and 0.36-0.38, respectively. Families Didymellaceae, Fomitopsidaceae, and Trichocomaceae were more abundant in the mycobiota of hypocotyls in Capsicum spp.-P. capsici pathosystem. Principal Coordinate Analysis revealed that the two principal components account for 44%, 54.1% and 37.2% of the variation for the Families, Genus and Species, respectively. This analysis suggested that the mycobiome is unaffected by P. capsici, this being exclusive to the Capsicum genotype. These findings could be important in understanding the role of the microbiome in resistant plants to oomycetes.

However, urbanization has largely destroyed the original native ecosystems and has caused a homogenization where frequently native species are replaced by non-native species. When attempting to understand the role of trees in urban settings, it is important to generate science-based data on the spatial distribution of trees, their species composition and tree species diversity as a function of the degree of urbanization. Such information may specifically inform the planning of effective long-term management of trees across urban and rural gradients. A total of 23 of 1 ha each were surveyed along a Northern research transect laid out along the urban-rural gradient of the metropolitan area of Bengaluru, India. Plots were randomly selected from the stratum "settlement areas", where WorldView-3 imagery supported both stratification and plot selection. The plots were fully mapped for trees, where a total of eleven variables had been observed for each tree. In addition, the basal area and wood volume was calculated to understand the biomass potential of the trees in the plots. The diversity indices such as the Shannon index, Simpson index, Pielou's evenness and Margalef's richness were considered for comparing the species diversity, composition and distribution along the gradient of Bengaluru. A total of 1128 individuals of 93 tree species were recorded. Among 92 species identified along the northern gradient, 53 are exotic, and 39 are native species. The Shannon-Wiener index varied from 1.33 to 2.72; Simpson's index varied from 0.65 to 0.90; Pielou's index varied from 0.66 to 0.90, and Margalef's index ranged from 1.41 to 5.20 along the gradient. The basal area increased from 96.39 m(2) to 102.76 m(2) from 2017 to 2019 along the transect, with a net gain of 6.37 m(2). Similarly, the wood volume increased from 1819.57 m(3) to 1926.23 m(3) with a net gain of 106.66 m(3). The present study reports on tree distribution, species composition and tree species diversity along a gradient from the city center to the rural surroundings of northern parts of Bengaluru city. The information generated may support the city planners/administrators by providing a holistic understanding of the species composition and abundance for a further selection of adaptive species and appropriate tree and vegetation management practices to conserve the existing green spaces and contribute towards sustainable urban planning. The sample plots laid out may also serve as permanent observation plots for monitoring the dynamics of tree cover in the city.

A field trial was established to test the hypothesis that enhanced crop diversity with the integration of WCC in a conventional maize-soy rotation promotes microbial diversity and the biological sink of H-2 in soil, while reducing N2O emissions to the atmosphere. Vicia villosa (hairy vetch), Avena sativa (oat), and Raphanus sativus (Daikon radish) were cultivated alone or in combinations and flux measurements were performed throughout two subsequent growing seasons. Soil acted as a net sink for H-2 and as a net source for CO2 and N2O. CO2 flux was the most sensitive to WCC whereas a significant spatial variation was observed for H-2 flux with soil uptake rates observed in the most productive area two-fold greater than the baseline level. Sequencing and quantification of taxonomic and functional genes were integrated to explain variation in trace gas fluxes with compositional changes in soil microbial communities. Fungal communities were the most sensitive to WCC, but neither community abundance nor beta diversity were found to be indicative of fluxes. The alpha diversity of taxonomic and functional genes, expressed as the number of effective species, was integrated into composite variables extracted from multivariate analyses. Only the composite variable computed with the inverse Simpson's index displayed a reproducible pattern throughout both growing seasons, with functional genes and bacterial 16S rRNA gene defining the two most contrasting gradients. The composite variable was decoupled from WCC treatment and explained 19-20% spatial variation of H-2 fluxes. The coupling of composite alpha diversity metrics derived from multiple genes with soil processes warrants further investigations to implement novel indicators of soil health in response to changing management practices at the local scale.

The water parameters were estimated following Trivedy and Goel (Environ Publ 6:10-12, 1986) and APHA (American Public Health Association, Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, Method, 2005), while biodiversity indices were used to calculate the algal diversity, richness, evenness and similarity index. The result revealed that pH and the concentrations of Fe, Ni, Mn, and Zn were found to be significantly elevated as compared to BIS/WHO recommended level for drinking water. A total of 29 algal species belonging to 12 families were enumerated from the 4 seasons. Biodiversity indices such as Margalef richness index, Shannon-Weiner index, and Simpson's diversity presented maximum values in summer while Pielou's evenness did not vary significantly between seasons. Sorenson's index presented the lowest similarity (25%) and highest dissimilarity (75%) between winter and spring. The water quality status revealed that Simsang river water is deteriorated and needs to be pre-treated before utilization. Furthermore, the river condition as observed during the study period felt the necessity to adopt proper management policy and conservation efforts by the local inhabitants to protect the Simsang river.

J	Wang, Mengyu; Lu, Nan; An, Nannan; Fu, Bojie								Plant Functional and Phylogenetic Diversity Regulate Ecosystem Multifunctionality in Semi-Arid Grassland During Succession								FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE				9						791801	10.3389/fenvs.2021.791801			JAN 5 2022	2022	The relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF) is crucial for understanding the processes of ecological restoration in semi-arid regions. However, partitioning the relative influence of various biodiversity attributes, namely taxonomic, functional, and phylogenetic diversity, on EMF during secondary succession is still unclear. This study aimed to bridge the gap by employing field measurements and the chronosequence approach at 21 plots with different stand ages and precipitation conditions on the Loess Plateau of China. For diversity indices, we calculated the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson's dominance index, Pielou evenness index, community weighted mean (CWM), functional variance (FDvar), and Faith's phylogenetic diversity (PD) based on the empirically measured composition and traits of plant species. The EMF was expressed as the averaged value of eight function variables (including aboveground biomass, root biomass, soil total carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus content, soil organic carbon, available nitrogen and available phosphorus content). The results showed that species evenness and CWM of leaf dry matter content (LDMC) significantly increased yet the CWM of specific leaf area (SLA) decreased with stand age, indicating the resource-use strategy of the plants became more conservative through succession into its later stages. The EMF increased with both stand age and mean annual precipitation. The structural equation model revealed that stand age, soil water content (SWC), and the multiple diversity indices altogether accounted for 56.0% of the variation in the EMF. PD and the CWMs of plant height and LDMC had positive effects on the EMF, and the FDvar of leaf nitrogen had negative effects on EMF. However, the Shannon Wiener diversity had no significant effect on the EMF. Our results suggest that functional and phylogenetic diversity are more important than taxonomic diversity in predicting EMF, and that multidimensional biodiversity indices should be jointly considered to better predict EMF during the succession of semiarid grasslands.

Weed Communities of Field Crops in the Newly Reclaimed Lands of Suez Canal Region, Egypt								CATRINA-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES				26	1			33	55					2022	2022	One significant biotic barrier to crop production is weeds. The present study aims to analyze the weed vegetation associated with cultivated crops in the newly reclaimed lands in the three Suez Canal governorates (Ismailia, Suez and Port-Said). A total of 148 weed species (96 annuals and 52 perennials) belonging to 110 genera and 26 families were recorded. The most species-rich families were Poaceae, Asteraceae, Amaranthaceae and Fabaceae. Therophytes and Chamaephytes were the most prevailing life-forms. The chorological analysis of the vegetation revealed that Cosmopolitan, Saharo-Sindian and Mediterranean chorotypes either pure or extended into other regions form the major component of the floristic structure. The application of TWINSPAN classification technique yielded four vegetation groups. These groups were dominated by Schismus barbatus, Senecio glaucus, Cynodon dactylon and Melilotus indicus. Biodiversity indices (species richness, Shannon's index, Simpson's index and Evenness index) indicated that vegetation group B was the most diversified among other groups. The ordination of stands in the study area by using DECORANA program showed that the vegetation groups obtained by TWINSAPAN are distinguishable and have a clear-cut pattern of segregation on the ordination diagrams. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) indicated that soil texture, total nitrogen, calcium, magnesium, potassium, sulphates, electrical conductivity and organic matter were the main soil parameters which determined the distribution of weed vegetation in the study area.

Although examinations of diversity patterns at various spatial scales are frequently conducted, life stages are rarely accounted for. Pine-oak mixedwood forest is widely distributed around the world and constitutes main forest type in the Nanpan River Basin in southwest China. We established a fixed plot with an area of 100 m x 100 m in an undisturbed forest stand and classified trees according to five life stages based on their diameter at breast height (DBH) and height. Then, we calculated eight traditional diversity indices for each life stage. We found that species richness (R), abundance (N), and three diversity indices first increased and then decreased with increasing life stage. As sampling area increased, R, the Shannon-Wiener index (H') and Simpson's diversity index (D) first increased quickly, followed by a reduced rate of increase, whereas N showed a linear increase and three evenness indices showed gradual decreases. Global Moran's I values for each diversity index were small, indicating weak spatial autocorrelation. Both R and N of shrubs and saplings decreased sharply with life stage, with only large trees comprising the later life stages. Our results indicate that species diversity patterns in pine-oak forests, particularly in early successional stages, differ among life stages. The changes contribute to the understanding and conservation of forest biodiversity.

It is the intentional involvement of plant commu-nities and insectary plants in managed landscapes influencing natural ene-mies survival. These natural enemies lead to reduction in pest population in environmentally acceptable production practices. Field experiments were conducted during 2019 and 2020 to evaluate impact of ecological engineer-ing on the flea beetles, Phyllotreta striolata and Altica himensis and their natural enemies on brinjal crop. Three treatments with different plant spe-cies were worked out for pest management study. Results showed that Treatment I caused maximum increase in mean number of natural enemies (1.11/ 10 plants) which in turn brought maximum mean pest reduction. Treatment II caused second maximum increase in mean number of natural enemies (0.92/ 10 plants). Treatment III caused minimum increase in mean number of natural enemies (0.68/ 10 plants). The diversity of predators was documented in different treatments. Simpson's diversity index, Shannon -Weiner index and Evenness index were found higher in Treatment I followed by Treatment II and Treatment III. The maximum mean percent increase of natural enemies in main crop over control (250.52 %) with maximum mean % reduction of target pest (63.46 %) was observed in Treatment I. The mean percent increase of natural enemies in main crop over control (167.44 %) with mean % reduction of target pest (54.41 %) was observed in Treatment II.

Assessing the diversity and evenness of ecosystem services as perceived by residents using participatory mapping								APPLIED GEOGRAPHY				138						102624	10.1016/j.apgeog.2021.102624			JAN 2022	2022	While the benefits of multifunctional landscapes has been underlined by previous studies, assessing human perceptions of these benefits can be enhanced by applying methodological approaches that examine the perceived distributions and interactions among ecosystem services. This study applied Shannon's diversity and Simpson's evenness metrics from landscape ecology to advance an approach for assessing general and place-specific patterns of perceived ecosystem services and the existence of ecosystem service bundles in North Khorasan, Iran. A typology of 12 different ecosystem services, within three categories of provisioning, cultural ecosystem services, and biodiversity was established. A total of 158 individuals from the study area mapped these services individually on a hard copy through interviews and filled a semi-structured questionnaire regarding their socio-economic characteristics. In addition to showing areas of value abundance and diversity, we showed areas where specific ecosystem services were evenly or unevenly distributed across the landscape. Grazing ecosystem service showed to have the most even distribution in the study area, followed by cultivation and aesthetics as next services with more spread-out areal distributions. We found strong correlations between different types of cultural ecosystem services including tourism, social and spiritual services, which formed bundles on the landscape. The results also revealed partial bundling of clean water service with cultural ecosystem services and other provisioning services such as grazing. We conclude that these perceptions can complement the information necessary to develop sustainable planning and management strategies in order to promote landscape multi-functionality.

Amsterdam Mucociliary Clearance Di						Comparison of microbial composition of cough swabs and sputum for pathogen detection in patients with cystic fibrosis								JOURNAL OF CYSTIC FIBROSIS				21	1			52	60		10.1016/j.jcf.2021.08.031			JAN 2022	2022	Background: With the continued advancement of CFTR modulator therapies there is likely to be a burgeoning population of adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients unable to expectorate sputum. Consequently, the detection and surveillance of pulmonary colonisation, previously reliant on sputum culture, needs reexamining. We hypothesised that cough swabs analysed with culture-independent analysis of the 16S gene could serve as a surrogate for colonisation of the lower airways. Methods: Cough swabs and sputum samples were prospectively collected from consecutive adults and children with CF across two sites at regular outpatient appointments. Conventional culture analysis and next generation sequencing were used to compare paired same day samples. Results: Twenty-two adults and 8 paediatric patients provided 75 paired cough swabs and sputum samples. Alpha diversity measures showed increased bacterial richness in sputum, while evenness and Simpson's diveristy index were higher in cough swabs. Within each sampling technique, microbial composition showed greater similarity when considering intra-patient variation. Poor concordance was observed between culture independent cough swabs and culture dependent/independent sputum analysis for specific pathogens, with cough swabs unable to accurately identify commonly associated CF pathogens (AUROCC range: 0.51 to 0.64). Conclusion: Culture independent analysis of cough swabs provides an inaccurate diagnosis of lower respiratory tract colonisation and should not be used as a diagnostic test in patients with CF.

A total of five orders, 21 families, 45 genera and 121 species of fish were recorded with Perciformes (78.5%) being the most diverse. The highest number (5) of dominant species was found near Chenhang Island while the lowest (2) number was detected at Zhubi Reef. The highest abundance index (7.21) occurred at Zhubi Reef, while the Shannon-Wiener diversity (4.80), Pielou's evenness (0.81), and Simpson's dominance (0.95) indexes were all highest at Qiliangyu Island. Based on cluster analysis and non-metric multi-dimensional scaling (NMDS), fish communities varied more spatially than seasonally. Our results led us to hypothesize that the habitat complexity and level of anthropogenic disturbance were the main factors affecting the composition of reef-dwelling fish on each coral reef. Topography was likely responsible for most variation in the spatial pattern of fish diversity.

J	Tikadar, Kishor Kumar; Kunda, Mrityunjoy; Mazumder, Sabuj Kanti								Diversity of fishery resources and catch efficiency of fishing gears in Gorai River, Bangladesh								HELIYON				7	12					e08478	10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e08478			DEC 2021	2021	Gorai River is one of the important rivers in Bangladesh for rich aquatic biodiversity. The river is originated from the Ganges-Padma River system, a trans-boundary river between India and Bangladesh. Once the river was rich in fish biodiversity, but due to man-made and natural causes the availability of fish reduced drastically. A comprehensive analysis of fish diversity indices, gear efficiency, catch composition and decline causes of fish diversity in Gorai River, Bangladesh was accomplished. The data were collected on monthly basis from January to December 2018 from three major fishing sites of the river. A total of 62 fish and 2 prawn species under 12 orders and 24 families were recorded. Cypriniformes was the leading order consisting 27% of the total catch. The mean values of Shannon-Weaver diversity (H'), Simpson's index (1-D), Margalef's richness (d) and Pielou's evenness (J') indices were recorded as, 1.478 +/- 0.495, 0.57 +/- 0.197, 15.115 +/- 4.435 and 0.481 +/- 0.152, respectively. At the similarity of 58.7%, two groups were attained in the cluster analysis and the Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (nMDS) showed 40% similarity among the three sites in twelve months based on the Bray-Curtis similarity matrix. The highest and lowest CPUE were recorded from seine net (5.2 +/- 1.72 kg gear(-1) haul(-1)) and hook & long lines (0.0135 +/- 0.0015 kg gear(-1) haul(-1)), respectively whereas, highest and lowest gear efficiency were recorded from lift net (0.321 +/- 0.036 kg gear(-1) person(-1 )hour(-1)) and fish trap (0.0005 +/- 0.0002 kg gear(-1 )person(-1) hour(-1)), respectively. Alternatively, the highest fish catch was recorded on April (21228 +/- 464.38 kg) and lowest on August (3855 +/- 138.21 kg). According to the fishermen fish biodiversity of the Gorai River declined day by day due to overexploitation, destructive fishing practice, pollution, construction of obstacles for fish movement, and natural causes like siltation. Proper implementation of fish acts and regulations, use of authorized fishing gear, community-based fisheries management, sanctuary establishment and management, stocking of fish fingerling, and raising public awareness can play a great role in enhancing and conserving fish biodiversity in the Gorai River of Bangladesh.

Chott Sidi Abdel Salam oasis, with an area of approximately 100 ha, was chosen for this study (2018-2019). Aiming to effectively manage and protect the biodiversity of this coastal oasis, the cultivated vegetable, fungal and livestock diversity were investigated using ecological indicators. Our results indicated that the agricultural system in this oasis is traditionally organized into three vegetation layers: palm trees, fruit trees and herbaceous plants. 41 vegetable species, representing 18 families and 32 genera, have been recorded. The highest values of species richness, species diversity, Simpson's concentration of dominance, Simpson's diversity index and equitability of evenness were registered for the lowest layer. Also, 15 fungal families, belonging to 27 genera and 33 species, were recorded in this oasis where the most frequent fungal species were Erysiphe pisi, Leveillula taurica and Sphaerotheca fuliginea. The ongoing results revealed that sheep (35.91%) registered the highest number of livestock, followed by poultry (32.17%). The findings of this study establish basic information on the overall biodiversity status in Chott Sidi Abdel Salam coastal oasis; some recommendations to maintain and conserve this rare agrosystem are also presented in this paper.

A good measure gives precise, reliable, and efficient information about the community structure. This study was conducted to evaluate the statistical properties and test some alpha diversity indices' efficiency through a bootstrap resampling. The available birds' data were being applied in some alpha diversity indices. Moreover, the Shapiro-Wilk test is being used to test the normality of the index. All indices analyzed have p -values higher than the alpha level of significance (alpha=0.05), indicating that the index's bootstrap sampling distribution is normally distributed. Mostly, all indices are consistently efficient at large sample sizes. The Menhinick richness index is more efficient in measuring birds' species richness since it has the smallest means squared error (MSE) values. Among the diversity indices studied in this paper, Simpson's diversity index generated smaller mean squared error (MSE) values; thus, it is a more efficient diversity index in measuring birds' diversity. The Shannon evenness index is more efficient among the five evenness indices in measuring species evenness of birds because it provides the smaller MSE values.

This phenomenon has (direct and indirect) environmental implications, both positive and negative. The present study contributes to clarifying the intrinsic nexus between long-term urban expansion and forest dynamics in a representative Mediterranean city based on diachronic land-use maps. We discuss some counterintuitive results of urbanization as far as forest expansion, wildfire risk, and biodiversity conservation are concerned. Forest dynamics were investigated at two time intervals (1936-1974 and 1974-2018) representing distinctive socioeconomic contexts in the Rome metropolitan area in Central Italy. Additionally, the spatial relationship between forest cover and urban growth was evaluated using settlement density as a target variable. All over the study area, forest cover grew moderately over time (from 18.3% to 19.9% in the total landscape), and decreased along the urban gradient (i.e., with settlement density) more rapidly in 2018 than in 1936. The diversification of forest types (Shannon H index) was higher in areas with medium-density settlements, indicating a tendency towards more heterogeneous and mixed structures in rural and peri-urban woods that undergo rising human pressure. The dominance of a given forest type (Simpson's D index) was higher at high settlement density areas. Evenness (Pielou's J index) was the highest at low settlement density areas. The long-term assessment of land-use dynamics in metropolitan fringes enriched with a spatially explicit analysis of forest types may inform regional planning and environmental conservation, which could delineate appropriate strategies for sustainable land management in Southern European cities.

A Test of Foraging Models Using Dietary Diversity Indices for the Lomako Forest Bonobos								FOLIA PRIMATOLOGICA				92	4			211	226		10.1159/000519722			NOV 2021	2021	Optimal diet and functional response models are used to understand the evolution of primate foraging strategies. The predictions of these models can be tested by examining the geographic and seasonal variation in dietary diversity. Dietary diversity is a useful tool that allows dietary comparisons across differing sampling locations and time periods. Bonobos (Pan paniscus) are considered primarily frugivorous and consume fruits, leaves, insects, vertebrates, terrestrial herbaceous vegetation, and flowers. Frugivores, like bonobos, are valuable for examining dietary diversity and testing foraging models because they eat a variety of species and are subject to seasonal shifts in fruit availability. Frugivorous primate species thus allow for tests of how variation in dietary diversity is correlated with variation in ecological factors. We investigated measures of dietary diversity in bonobos at two research camps across field seasons within the same protected area (N'dele and Iyema) in Lomako Forest, Democratic Republic of the Congo. We compared the results of behavioral observation (1984/1985, 1991, 1995, 2014, and 2017) and fecal washing analysis (2007 and 2009) between seasons and study period using three diversity indices (Shannon's, Simpson's, and SW evenness). The average yearly dietary diversity indices at N'dele were Shannon's HMODIFIER LETTER PRIME = 2.04, Simpson's D = 0.82, and SW evenness = 0.88 while at Iyema, the indices were Shannon's HMODIFIER LETTER PRIME = 2.02, Simpson's D = 0.82, and SW evenness = 0.88. Behavioral observation data sets yielded significantly higher dietary diversity indices than fecal washing data sets. We found that food item (fruit, leaf, and flower) consumption was not associated with seasonal food availability for the 2017 behavioral observation data set. Shannon's index was lower during periods when fewer bonobo dietary items were available to consume and higher when fruit was abundant. Finally, we found that optimal diet models best-explained patterns of seasonal food availability and dietary diversity. Dietary diversity is an essential factor to consider when understanding primate diets and can be a tool in understanding variation in primate diets, particularly among frugivores. Dietary diversity varies across populations of the same species and across time, and it is critical in establishing a complete understanding of how primate diets change over time.

Influence of cage farming and environmental parameters on spatio-temporal variability of fish assemblage structure in a tropical reservoir of Peninsular India								LIMNOLOGICA				91						125925	10.1016/j.limno.2021.125925			NOV 2021	2021	Fish assemblage structure in Palair reservoir, a medium tropical reservoir along the river Paleru, a tributary of river Krishna in Southern India, was studied along the spatial gradient of the impoundment. The abundance and assemblage structure of wild fish aggregated around the fish cage units installed in the reservoir were assessed and compared with other sites. Seasonal sampling was carried out and fish community structure in terms of species composition and abundance, trophic guild, niche, tolerance, resilience and conservation status were analyzed. A total of 38 fish species were recorded wherein the family Cyprinidae dominated in the number of species (15) followed by Cichlidae and Channidae (3 each). Margalef richness index (d), Pielou's evenness index (J'), Simpson's index (1-lambda) and Shannon index (H') revealed significant variation across different zones. Species richness was maximum in the Site1 (d = 4.44-5.12), whereas the abundance of individuals was maximum at Site4 (H' = 2.65-2.86) i.e. near cage in the lacustrine zone. The important species contributing to the dissimilarities among the zones were identified and percentage of their contribution was estimated using SIMPER analysis. Trophic guild of fishes indicated the dominance of omnivorous species followed by carnivores, indicating the heterotrophic phase of the reservoir. The spatial and seasonal variations in the fish assemblage structure were tested applying statistical analyses such as PERMANOVA and nMDS. The results indicated a positive impact of cage farming in supporting the wild fish fauna, influencing the large aggregations of fishes around the cages. The temporal variability in the cage-associated fish assemblage was related to recruitment periods of juveniles (e.g. E. maculates and E. suratensis in summer, and S. seenghala in monsoon seasons). The links between fish assemblages and environmental parameters were explored through DISTILM and the deterministic factors for fish abundance in the reservoir were phosphate, pH, dissolved Oxygen, total hardness and depth. The study also indicated the impacts of cage culture with record of accidental escapes of farmed fish to the reservoir system. The baseline information generated and recommendations formulated in the study are crucial for the conservation of fish diversity, fisheries enhancement and management planning of tropical peninsular reservoirs.

Riparian vegetation structure and seasonality influence functional diversity more than taxonomic diversity of stream fish assemblages in the Colombian Amazon								AQUATIC ECOLOGY				56	1			153	172		10.1007/s10452-021-09904-y			MAR 2022	2022	The Amazon rainforest has experienced rapid land-use changes, including extensive deforestation of riparian areas, putting at risk among the most diverse freshwater fish assemblages on the planet. At nine study reaches distributed among three Colombian blackwater streams, we described and quantified how variability in riparian vegetation structure-during both dry and rainy seasons-influenced the taxonomic and functional diversity of fish assemblages. We observed 117 species across our study reaches, but taxonomic measures such as species richness and evenness were not different among low, intermediate, or high levels of riparian vegetation coverage. Fish assemblage composition was also not different by riparian vegetation, although we observed significant seasonal shifts-only 16% of species were observed in both rainy and dry seasons. Evenness and effective number of species derived from Simpson's Index were 7 and 38% greater in the dry season than in the rainy season, respectively. Diet varied by riparian zone condition: 56% of fish stomach contents were of allochthonous origin in stream reaches with intact vegetation versus 37% in streams with altered riparian vegetation. We also observed that the relative proportion of detritivorous fishes was 13% greater in the rainy season, while the proportion of invertivores was 26% greater in the dry season. Both functional divergence and dispersion-measures of the variability of species' traits-were higher in reaches with more intact vegetation during the rainy season. Our findings highlight the importance of the interaction of riparian vegetation and seasonality, and both longitudinal and lateral hydrological connectivity, for fish functional diversity of Amazonian streams.

The knowledge and understanding of local cultivars' genetic diversity are essential for properly managing genetic resources, conservation, sustainable use and their improvement through breeding. This study aimed to dissect phenotypic and molecular diversity of white yam cultivars from Benin using agro-morphological and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Eighty-eight Beninese white Guinea yam cultivars collected through a countrywide ethnobotanical survey were phenotyped with 53 traits and genotyped with 9725 DArT-SNP. Multivariate analysis using phenotypic traits revealed 30 traits as most discriminative and explained up to 80.78% of cultivars' phenotypic variation. Assessment of diversity indices such as Shannon-Wiener (H'), inverse Shannon (H.B.), Simpson's (lambda) index and Pilou evenness (J) based molecular and phenotypic data depicted a moderate genetic diversity in Beninese white Guinea yam cultivars. Genetic differentiation of cultivars among country production zones was low due to the high exchange of planting materials among farmers of different regions. However, there was high genetic diversity within regions. Hierarchical clusters (HCs) on phenotypic data revealed the presence of two groups while HCs based on the SNP markers and the combined analysis identified three genetic groups. Our result provided valuable insights into the Beninese white Guinea yam diversity for its proper conservation and improvement through breeding.

Legumes, preferred in sustainable cultivation systems, are particularly sensitive to pre-emergence damping-off of seedlings. Seed dressing is therefore a very important element in the cultivation technology. The aim of this study was to compare the impact of biological (Pythium oligandrum) and chemical (carboxin + thiuram) seed dressing on the quantitative and qualitative composition of microorganisms participating in the epidemiology of this disease, under specific hydrothermal conditions and chemical properties of the soil (pH, humus, macro-, and micronutrient). Microorganism identification was done using the MALDI-TOF MS (Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry) technique. Species were assigned to frequency groups, and populations of pathogens, saprophytes, and antagonists were identified. The biodiversity of these communities was expressed with Simpson's Reciprocal, Shannon-Wiener, and Evenness (Shannon) indices. In individual variants of seed pre-treatment, the correlations between individual edaphic factors and the suppression of pre-emergence damping-off, the number of isolates obtained from infected seedlings, and the share of individual trophic groups of fungi were assessed. The main causes of pre-emergence damping-off of broad bean seedlings are Ilyonectria destructans, Globisporangium irregulare, Fusarium equiseti, Rhizoctonia solani, and Fusarium solani. Eliminating seed treatment results in a seedling mortality rate of 33.5-42.5%. The effectiveness of the chemical protection product is 44.2% and 25.9%. Carboxin and thiuram reduce the diversity of microorganisms involved in the pathogenesis of pre-emergence damping-off and limit the presence of antagonistic fungi. Under the influence of P. oligandrum, there was a five-fold increase in the population of antagonists. An increase in humus in the soil reduces the percentage of diseased broad bean seedlings.

The current study will be the first report on species diversity, species composition, abundance, and distributional pattern of moth fauna in Aravalli Hill Range Rajasthan. During the survey period of 2018-2019, 758 specimens of moths were collected pertaining to 34 species, 26 genera belonging to 05 families, and 13 subfamilies from three different sites of Aravalli Hill Range. Based on the number of genera, family Sphingidae was most dominant with 9 genera, and family Crambidae was least dominant with 2 genera. Based on the number of species, the family Sphingidae was the most dominant, representing 13 species, followed by Erebidae representing 11 species, Saturniidae and Noctuidae with 4 species each, the least dominant was Crambidae with 2 species. The diversity indices for moths have been calculated for the first time from the Aravalli Range of Rajasthan.

J	Furnas, Brett J.; Goldstein, Benjamin R.; Figura, Peter J.								Intermediate fire severity diversity promotes richness of forest carnivores in California								DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS				28	3			493	505		10.1111/ddi.13374			MAR 2022	2022	Aim Fire can strongly influence ecosystem function, and human activities are disrupting fire activity at the global scale. Ecological theory and a growing body of literature suggest that a mixed severity fire regime promotes biodiversity in western North America. Some researchers advocate the use of pyrodiversity (i.e. heterogeneity in aspects of the fire regime such as time since fire or severity) as a conservation index to be maximized. Others caution against this approach arguing that the index oversimplifies fire-biodiversity interactions across trophic, spatial and temporal scales. We evaluated the effects of several landscape-scale pyrodiversity indices, and their severity and time-since-fire components, on species richness of forest carnivores. Location Northern California, United States. Methods We gathered data on fire history and mammal occurrence from camera trap surveys at 1,451 sites across Northern California public and private forestlands during 2009-2018. We used these data to model the effects of fire severity diversity, and its components (i.e. low, moderate and high severity wildfires), on carnivore richness at short (10 years) and longer (25 years) timeframes. We repeated the modelling using a measure of time-since-fire diversity and its components (<10 years, 10-20 years, 20-30 years, 30-40 years, 40-100 years). We used Bayesian multispecies occupancy modelling to correct for imperfect measurement of species richness. Results We found that carnivore richness was highest at locations with intermediate fire severity diversity (0.46, 90%CI: 0.40-0.52) calculated using Simpson's Measure of Evenness (range: 0-1) for the 10-year timeframe, and the results were almost identical yet less precise for the longer timeframe. When we separated fire severity diversity into its components, we found that carnivore richness was highest at locations where 17% (90%CI: 4-20) of the landscape had experienced low severity burns over the past decade. In contrast, we found no association between time-since-fire diversity and carnivore richness, however, an intermediate amount of one of the components (e.g., the total amount of fire in the past 10 years) was positively associated with carnivore richness. Our results are consistent with a mixed severity fire regime wherein there is a greater extent of low severity than high severity fire. Main conclusions Overall our results suggest that carnivores would benefit from landscapes managed for greater, but not maximal, fire severity diversity. Our results also suggest that prescribed, low severity burns may provide ecological services to wildlife not otherwise provided by silviculture in a managed forest landscape.

The objectives of this study were to investigate the lytic activity of endolysin LyJH307 against S. bovis and to explore changes in rumen fermentation and microbiota in an in vitro system. Two treatments were used: 1) control, corn grain without LyJH307; and 2) LyJH307, corn grain with LyJH307 (4 U/mL). An in vitro fermentation experiment was performed using mixture of rumen fluid collected from two cannulated Holstein steers (450 +/- 30 kg) and artificial saliva buffer mixed as 1:3 ratio for 12 h incubation time. In vitro dry matter digestibility, pH, volatile fatty acids, and lactate concentration were estimated at 12 h, and the gas production was measured at 6, 9, and 12 h. The rumen bacterial community was analyzed using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Results LyJH307 supplementation at 6 h incubation markedly decreased the absolute abundance of S. bovis (approximately 70% compared to control, P = 0.0289) and increased ruminal pH (P = 0.0335) at the 12 h incubation. The acetate proportion (P = 0.0362) was significantly increased after LyJH307 addition, whereas propionate (P = 0.0379) was decreased. LyJH307 supplementation increased D-lactate (P = 0.0340) without any change in L-lactate concentration (P > 0.10). There were no significant differences in Shannon's index, Simpson's index, Chao1 estimates, and evenness (P > 0.10). Based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity matrices, the LyJH307 affected the overall shift in microbiota (P = 0.097). LyJH307 supplementation induced an increase of 11 genera containing Lachnoclostridium, WCHB1-41, unclassified genus Selenomonadaceae, Paraprevotella, vadinBE97, Ruminococcus gauvreauii group, Lactobacillus, Anaerorhabdus furcosa group, Victivallaceae, Desulfuromonadaceae, and Sediminispirochaeta. The predicted functional features represented by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were changed by LyJH307 toward a decrease of carbohydrate metabolism. Conclusions LyJH307 caused a reduction of S. bovis and an increase of pH with shifts in minor microbiota and its metabolic pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism. This study provides the first insight into the availability of endolysin as a specific modulator for rumen and shows the possibility of endolysin degradation by rumen microbiota.

Given the importance of grasslands, research has been carried out in recent years on the potential to monitor them with novel remote sensing techniques. In this study, the optical diversity (also called spectral diversity) approach was adopted to check the potential of using high-resolution hyperspectral images to estimate alpha-diversity in grassland ecosystems. In 2018 and 2019, grassland species composition was surveyed and canopy hyperspectral data were acquired at two grassland sites: Monte Bondone (IT-MBo; species-rich semi-natural grasslands) and an experimental farm of the University of Padova, Legnaro, Padua, Italy (IT-PD; artificially established grassland plots with a species-poor mixture). The relationship between biodiversity (species richness, Shannon's, species evenness, and Simpson's indices) and optical diversity metrics (coefficient of variation-CV and standard deviation-SD) was not consistent across the investigated grassland plant communities. Species richness could be estimated by optical diversity metrics with an R = 0.87 at the IT-PD species-poor site. In the more complex and species-rich grasslands at IT-MBo, the estimation of biodiversity indices was more difficult and the optical diversity metrics failed to estimate biodiversity as accurately as in IT-PD probably due to the higher number of species and the strong canopy spatial heterogeneity. Therefore, the results of the study confirmed the ability of spectral proxies to detect grassland alpha-diversity in man-made grassland ecosystems but highlighted the limitations of the spectral diversity approach to estimate biodiversity when natural grasslands are observed. Nevertheless, at IT-MBo, the optical diversity metric SD calculated from post-processed hyperspectral images and transformed spectra showed, in the red part of the spectrum, a significant correlation (up to R = 0.56, p = 0.004) with biodiversity indices. Spatial resampling highlighted that for the IT-PD sward the optimal optical pixel size was 1 cm, while for the IT-MBo natural grassland it was 1 mm. The random pixel extraction did not improve the performance of the optical diversity metrics at both study sites. Further research is needed to fully understand the links between alpha-diversity and spectral and biochemical heterogeneity in complex heterogeneous ecosystems, and to assess whether the optical diversity approach can be adopted at the spatial scale to detect beta-diversity. Such insights will provide more robust information on the mechanisms linking grassland diversity and optical heterogeneity.

Kuntze (Brazilian pine)								BRAZILIAN JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY				52	3			1489	1501		10.1007/s42770-021-00531-1			SEP 2021	2021	The biodiversity of filamentous fungi and their ecological relationships in the context of decaying Araucaria angustifolia (an endangered conifer) substrates are still mostly unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the diversity of saprotrophic filamentous fungi, based on morphological identification, associated with A. angustifolia, in addition to assessing possible saprobic/plant affinity relationship, and verifying whether the study areas and substrates affect the composition of the mycobiota. A total of 5000 substrates (decaying needles and twigs) were collected during five expeditions (2014/2015) to two areas: Sao Francisco de Paula National Forest (FLONA-SFP) and Sao Joaquim National Park (PARNA-SJ), Brazil. A total of 135 species distributed among 85 genera, 40 families, nine classes, 24 orders, three subphyla, and two phyla were identified. One new genus and five new species that were previously described, and six rare species and five species with affinity for A. angustifolia were also recorded. The twigs showed a community of fungi with greater richness and dominance. Conversely, the values of abundance, Simpson's diversity index, and evenness were lower than those determined for needles. In terms of the study areas, FLONA-SFP showed higher values of richness, abundance, Simpson's diversity index, and evenness than PARNA-SJ. Principal coordinate analysis and similarity percentage analysis showed the influence of both substrate factors and areas in the composition of the fungal communities. The presence of new, rare, and affinity-related species reinforces the study of fungi in the context of the conservation of this conifer, as these species are threatened by co-extinction.

A total of seventy-five bacterial isolates identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a majority of genus as Bacillus and one Planococcus, which were grouped into eight different species. The Shannon diversity H' (1.56), Simpson's index of diversity (0.93), Magalef' index (2.23), Evenness (0.96), and Species richness (7) indicated the high endophytic bacterial diversity in the V1 variety of the tomato. Bacterial endophytes isolated from both of the varieties were screened for their antifungal activity against five economically critical fungal pathogens (viz., Botrytis cinerea, Rhizoctonia solani, Fusarium solani, Verticillium lateritium, and Alternaria solani) of tomato crop through dual culture assay. The data revealed B. siamensis strain NKIT9 as the most potent antagonist, significantly (p < 0.05) inhibiting the mycelial growth between 75 to 90% against selected fungal pathogens. High bioactivity of lipopeptide extract of strain NKIT9 was recorded against R. solani with minimum IC50 value of 230 mu g/ml. The Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-High Definition Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-HDMS) analysis of this lipopeptide extract revealed the presence of Surfactin and Bacillomycin D. Furthermore, in-vitro results showed that the selected bacterial strain significantly minimized the disease incidence in damping-off assay which makes this strain a promising antifungal bio-control agent. Moreover, in the pot experiment the NKIT9 increased the fruit yield by 59.2% compared with the untreated R. solani infested control.

Dilantha								Validating the Strategic Deployment of Blackleg Resistance Gene Groups in Commercial Canola Fields on the Canadian Prairies								FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE				12						669997	10.3389/fpls.2021.669997			JUN 10 2021	2021	Blackleg, caused by the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans, is a serious threat to canola (Brassica napus L.) production in western Canada. Crop scouting and extended crop rotation, along with the use of effective genetic resistance, have been key management practices available to mitigate the impact of the disease. In recent years, new pathogen races have reduced the effectiveness of some of the resistant cultivars deployed. Strategic deployment and rotation of major resistance (R) genes in cultivars have been used in France and Australia to help increase the longevity of blackleg resistance. Canada also introduced a grouping system in 2017 to identify blackleg R genes in canola cultivars. The main objective of this study was to examine and validate the concept of R gene deployment through monitoring the avirulence (Avr) profile of L. maculans population and disease levels in commercial canola fields within the Canadian prairies. Blackleg disease incidence and severity was collected from 146 cultivars from 53 sites across Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta in 2018 and 2019, and the results varied significantly between gene groups, which is likely influenced by the pathogen population. Isolates collected from spring and fall stubble residues were examined for the presence of Avr alleles AvrLm1, AvrLm2, AvrLm3, AvrLm4, AvrLm5, AvrLm6, AvrLm7, AvrLm9, AvrLm10, AvrLm11, AvrLepR1, AvrLepR2, AvrLep3, and AvrLmS using a set of differential host genotypes carrying known resistance genes or PCR-based markers. The Simpson's evenness index was very low, due to two dominant L. maculans races (AvrLm2-4-5-6-7-10-11 and AvrLm2-5-6-7-10-11) representing 49% of the population, but diversity of the population was high from the 35 L. maculans races isolated in Manitoba. AvrLm6 and AvrLm11 were found in all 254 L. maculans isolates collected in Manitoba. Knowledge of the blackleg disease levels in relation to the R genes deployed, along with the L. maculans Avr profile, helps to measure the effectiveness of genetic resistance.

It is a relatively rare fish species; therefore, published data on the parasite communities of P. charcoti are limited. The present study was performed on the Ukrainian Antarctic Station "Akademik Vernadsky", Argentine Islands, West Antarctica and the purpose was to examine the species diversity of the parasites of P. charcoti and to identify the parameters of helminth infection and helminth component community. Methods Fifteen specimens of P. charcoti were caught at a depth of 10-30 m and examined using standard parasitological techniques. All helminths (6251 specimens) were collected manually, fixed in 70% ethanol and identified based on their morphology. Results All examined specimens of P. charcoti were found to be infected with helminths; each fish harboured 10-20 helminth species (mean 13.2; median 13) and 237-804 helminth specimens (mean 417; median 401). Twenty-seven helminth species were found, including nine species of trematodes, 4 of cestodes, 4 of nematodes and 10 of acanthocephalans. P. charcoti is the definitive host for 11 out of 27 helminth species recorded. In the helminth component community, the diversity indices were 2.03 (Shannon's index) and 0.79 (Simpson's index); Pielou evenness index was 0.61, and Berger-Parker dominance index was 0.38. Conclusions Our results indicate a high species diversity and complex structure of the helminth community in Antarctic dragonfish P. charcoti in the Argentine Islands.

Individual differences in behaviour and gut bacteria are associated in collared peccary (Mammalia, Tayassuidae)								JOURNAL OF APPLIED MICROBIOLOGY				131	6			2748	2762		10.1111/jam.15133			DEC 2021	2021	Aims We tested the hypothesis that the behaviour of an individual is associated with the diversity of its gut bacteria, using the collared peccary (Pecari tajacu) as a model. Methods and Results In all, 24 adult male collared peccaries received either low- (n = 12) or high-fibre diet (n = 12) to induce contrasting gut fermentation profiles. They were submitted to three short-term challenges, allowing us to rate the animals in a coping-style dimension named 'calmness'. At the end of the experimental period, we collected samples of peccaries' forestomach contents to characterize bacterial diversity. We found a significant positive association between individual 'calmness' z-scores and the bacterial evenness index in gut bacteria (and a similar trend with the Simpson's diversity index), suggesting a more homogeneous bacterial community of calmer individuals. We also found a positive association between fibres digestibility and gut bacterial diversity in the peccaries' forestomach, but no effect of the dietary fibre level. Conclusions Gut bacteria evenness increases with 'calmness' z-scores, suggesting a more homogeneous bacterial community of calmer individuals, compared with the more heterogeneous of the most distressed ones. Our results also suggest associations between the digestibility of ADF with the gut bacterial diversity indices and with the relative abundance of the Actinobacteria phylum. Significance and Impact of the Study Our data showed that the hosts' individual behavioural differences are potentially aligned with gut bacterial diversity. The behaviour-microbiota link is correlated with host feed efficiency and, ultimately, may have implications for animal health and welfare of farm animals.		[Cairo, P. L. G.; Nogueira, S. S.

Knowing the condition of the soil food web through the communities that inhabit it is necessary to assess the productivity of the soil. Nematode communities in the soil food web can be used as indicators because of their high abundance, and they inhabit various trophic levels, and participate in several important processes in the soil. The soil food web condition from three locations (Agr1, Agr2, Agr3) through the nematode functional index was evaluated using the maturity index (MI), the maturity index 2-5 (MI-25), the plant-parasitic index (PPI), the channel index (CI), the enrichment index (EI), the structure index (SI), and the basal index (BI). Nematode diversity was evaluated using Simpson's index of diversity, dominance, and evenness. The MI and MI2-5 scores indicated that Agr3 (3.81) had an undisturbed food web, while Agr2 (2.88 and 3.0) and Agr1 (2.5 and 2.51) were in a moderate condition with minor disturbances. Fauna profile analysis using SI and EI shows that Agr3 and Agr1 had an undisturbed soil food web, and Agr2 was in enriched conditions. CI results found that Agr1 and Agr3 had a fungal decomposition pathway while Agr2 had a bacterial decomposition pathway. This research showed that prospect of the nematode community to serve as a collection of biological indicator data in assessing soil or ecosystem health can be considered in further research.

This study assessed the soil microbial diversity, richness, and community structure following 10 years of pasture management (organic or non-organic) of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Soil samples were collected from 0-15 cm in July and August from 2017-2018 and soil nutrient properties (nutrients, carbon, nitrogen, and pH) quantified and correlated with soil microbial diversity. Overall, greater soil bacterial species richness (P <= 0.05) occurred in organic relative to non-organic (conventional) systems. Management affected bacterial species richness (Chao1), with greater richness occurring in organic pasture soils and less richness occurring in non-organic systems (P <= 0.05). Similarly, management affected bacterial evenness (Simpson's index), with a more diverse community occurring in organically managed soils relative to non-organic pastures (P <= 0.05). Linear discriminant analysis effect size analysis showed statistically significant and biologically consistent differences in bacterial taxa in organic compared with non-organic soils. Therefore, there was a shift in bacterial community structure in organic relative to non-organic soils (P <= 0.05). Additionally, soil nutrients (Fe, Mg, Ni, S, Al, K, Cd, and Cu), pH, C, and N were correlated with one or more dominant bacterial phyla (Gemmatimonadetes, Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Acidobacteria). Overall, pasture management affected soil microbial diversity, with greater diversity occurring in organic than non-organic systems, likely owing to applications of organic poultry litter in organic systems compared to non-organic management (use of inorganic-fertilizers and herbicides). Results indicate that when pastures are converted to organic production systems, soil microbial richness and diversity may increase, thereby resulting in enhanced soil microbiome diversity and overall ecosystem services.

Current study was designed to investigate the floristic composition, community structure and distribution pattern of the alpine vegetation communities in the Ratti Gali area. Extensive vegetation sampling was carried out during June-August 2019 by quadrate based systematic sampling covering all the alpine microhabitats. Results revealed a total of 99 plant species recorded from the area belonging 36 families and 77 genera with Compositae as the most dominant family (16 species) followed by Rosaceae and Polygonaceae with 9 and 6 species respectively. Life form analysis revealed Hemicryptophytes as the dominant life form with 47 species (47.4%) followed by Therophytes whereas Leaf Size analysis showed the dominance of Microphylls with 35 species (35.4%) followed by Leptophylls. Bistorta amplexicaule was the most dominant species having an importance value of 29.0 followed by Geranium pratense and Sibbaldia cunneata. Study sites showed an average species count of 24.7; average value of Simpson?s diversity as 0.91; Shannon?s diversity as 2.88; species richness as 1.41; Evenness as 0.77 whereas average maturity index value as 33.07. Our findings revealed that the alpine vegetation of the area is seriously threatened due to immense anthropogenic pressure attributed to huge tourist influx, heavy over grazing, medicinal plant exploitation and soil erosion. We recommend immediate implementation of conservation measures in this fragile alpine habitat to protect the precious alpine floral wealth of the region.

Bacterial community analysis of purulent material from liver abscesses of crossbred cattle and Holstein steers fed finishing diets with or without tylosin								JOURNAL OF ANIMAL SCIENCE				99	4					skab076	10.1093/jas/skab076			APR 2021	2021	Liver abscesses in feedlot cattle are polymicrobial infections. Culture-based studies have identified Fusobacterium necrophorum as the primary causative agent, but a number of other bacterial species are frequently isolated. The incidence of liver abscesses is highly variable and is affected by a number of factors, including cattle type. Holstein steers raised for beef production have a higher incidence than crossbred feedlot cattle. lylosin is the commonly used antimicrobial feed additive to reduce the incidence of liver abscesses. The objective of this study was to utilize 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequence analyses to analyze the bacterial community composition of purulent material of liver abscesses of crossbred cattle (n = 24) and Holstein steers (n = 24), each fed finishing diet with or without tylosin. DNA was extracted and the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed. The minimum, mean, and maximum sequence reads per sample were 996, 177,070, and 877,770, respectively, across all the liver abscess samples. Sequence analyses identified 5 phyla, 14 families, 98 genera, and 102 amplicon sequence variants (ASV) in the 4 treatment groups. The dominant phyla identified were Fusobacteria (52% of total reads) and Proteobacteria (33%). Of the top 25 genera identified, 17 genera were Gram negative and 8 were Gram positive. The top 3 genera, which accounted for 75% of the total reads, in the order of abundance, were Fusobacterium, Pseudomonas, and Bacteroides. The relative abundance, expressed as percent of total reads, of phyla, family, and genera did not differ (P > 0.05) between the 4 treatment groups. Generic richness and evenness, determined by Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's diversity indices, respectively, did not differ between the groups. The UniFrac distance matrices data revealed no clustering of the ASV indicating variance between the samples within each treatment group. Co-occurrence network analysis at the genus level indicated a strong association of Fusobacterium with 15 other genera, and not all of them have been previously isolated from liver abscesses. In conclusion, the culture-independent method identified the bacterial composition of liver abscesses as predominantly Gram negative and Fusobacterium as the dominant genus, followed by Pseudomonas. The bacterial community composition did not differ between crossbred and Holstein steers fed finishing diets with or without tylosin.

In this context, techniques of spectral mixture analysis may have an advantage over traditional methods of land cover classification because they allow to decompose the spectral signature of a mixed pixel into several endmembers and their respective abundances. In this work, we present the application of Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to quantify habitat diversity and assess the compositional turnover at different spatial scales in the fine-grained landscapes of the Cantabrian Mountains (northwestern Iberian Peninsula). A Landsat-8 OLI scene and high-resolution orthophotographs (25 cm) were used to build a region-specific spectral library of the main types of habitats in this region (arboreal vegetation; shrubby vegetation; herbaceous vegetation; rocks-soil and water bodies). We optimized the spectral library with the Iterative Endmember Selection (IES) method and we applied MESMA to unmix the Landsat scene into five fraction images representing the five defined habitats (root mean square error, RMSE <= 0.025 in 99.45% of the pixels). The fraction images were validated by linear regressions using 250 reference plots from the orthophotographs and then used to calculate habitat diversity at the pixel (alpha-diversity: 30 x 30 m), landscape (gamma-diversity: 1 x 1 km) and regional (epsilon-diversity: 110 x 33 km) scales and the compositional turnover (beta- and delta-diversity) according to Simpson's diversity index. Richness and evenness were also computed. Results showed that fraction images were highly related to reference data (R-2 >= 0.73 and RMSE <= 0.18). In general, our findings indicated that habitat diversity was highly dependent on the spatial scale, with values for the Simpson index ranging from 0.20 +/- 0.22 for alpha-diversity to 0.60 +/- 0.09 for gamma-diversity and 0.72 +/- 0.11 for epsilon-diversity. Accordingly, we found beta-diversity to be higher than delta-diversity. This work contributes to advance in the estimation of ecological diversity in complex landscapes, showing the potential of MESMA to quantify habitat diversity in a comprehensive way using Landsat imagery.

They have occupied a marvelous place, i.e., they play a vital role in the contribution of public consideration towards natural habitats and considered as barometers of an ecosystem. This study was carried out to determine the bird species diversity of the Sheikh Badin National Park, located in District Dera Ismail Khan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan. For this purpose, bird watching surveys following line transect method were conducted from June 2018 to July 2019 in the study area. A total 3408 individuals (1260 migrants and 2148 residents) representing the 41 bird species were recorded during the surveys. Among the total, 18 species were migrants and 23 residents, belong to 11 Orders and 25 Families. Passeriformes was the dominant encompass of 19 species (9 native and 10 migrants) and 13 families. This national park harbored species richness was r = 41, Shannon-Weiner diversity index (H' = 3.546), evenness (J' 0.955) and Simpson's Diversity (D = 0.966). The foraging guild results revealed that the granivore (2274) and insectivore (565) were the most abundant bird species. The major threats to the avifauna were illegal hunting, grazing and deforestation.

J	Zhang, Qi-peng; Wang, Jian; Wang, Qian								Effects of abiotic factors on plant diversity and species distribution of alpine meadow plants								ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS				61						101210	10.1016/j.ecoinf.2021.101210			MAR 2021	2021	The alpine meadow is a type of vegetation with significant ecological and economic values. Plant diversity and species distribution are affected by ecological environment. To study the influence of abiotic factors (topographic factors and soil chemical and physical properties), it can understand plant communities? formation and the adaptation of plants to abiotic factors. Here, we explored the influence of the abiotic factors on the plant diversity and species distribution through the investigation of alpine meadow vegetation and abiotic factors at the northeast Tibetan Plateau, the results of the laboratory experiments, and the representative difference analysis (RDA) to find the ordination differences. Our results revealed that 11 ordered abiotic factors explained the 25.5% of the distribution of the alpine meadow species. The slope, soil total nitrogen (STN), and soil organic matter (SOM) have a significant influence on the distribution of the alpine meadow species. According to the RDA analysis of the correlation between plant diversity and abiotic factors, the cumulative interpretation value of the four ordination axes was 39.0%. Slope and STN has a strong correlation with plant diversity, respectively. STN, soil total phosphorus (STP), soil total potassium (STK), and soil water content (SWC) has positive relationships with the plant diversity index, respectively, suggesting that those factors above mentioned are the main factors affecting the diversity of species in alpine meadows. Slope, aspect, and soil temperature (ST) has negative relationships with the Partrick index, Simpson?s diversity index, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index, indicating that with the slope increases, the plant diversity decreases, and the plant diversity also decrease at the sunward aspect. The soil has a more significant impact on the Pielou?s evenness index, but the topography has a weaker influence on the Pielou?s evenness index. The plant diversity and species distribution of alpine meadow in Tibet Plateau are affected by many abiotic factors. In our study, we found that slope and STN were the main factors affecting the plant diversity and species distribution in alpine meadows.

However, the issue on what the relationships between POIs and urbanization, and how do POIs affect urban forest was rarely mentioned in previous studies. In our research, a total of 82,978 POI records (reclassed to 7 categories of catering and restaurants, commercial areas, educational and institutional areas, public services, residential areas, scenic spots and shopping areas) were collected to analyze their influence on woody plant diversity and urban forest landscape metrics according to a distance gradient using field measurements of diversity and imagery delineated urban forest patches. The results revealed that the urbanization intensity (computed as impervious surface area proportion) was linearly decreased with the increase of distance from POIs except for scenic spots. When it close to POIs, the woody plant species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity and evenness gradually increased, whereas the Simpson's diversity decreased. Meanwhile, the urban forest patches delineated from fine-resolution images got smaller, less shape complexity and fragmented with mean patch area (AREA_MN), area-weighted mean shape index (SHAPE_AM) and area-weighted mean contiguity index (CONTIG_AM) decreased and patch density (PD) increased. This study can improve our understanding on the diversity, distribution of urban forest and its relationship with human activities, and guide us in urban forest planning and management.

Divergence and genetic diversity were assessed in a set of 20 maize genotypes representing popcorn, white corn, sweet corn and yellow corn, through morphological characteristics and Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Field experiment was conducted in randomized complete block design with three replications. Morphological data revealed that sweet corn genotype SCLY-1 was earlier in days to 50% pollen shedding than other genotypes while white corn genotype WL-3 was earlier in days to 50% silking. Maximum plant height was recorded for PCLY-5 (133.3 cm) while lowest for WL-4 (92.8 cm), whereas highest ears height was recorded for popcorn PCLY-1 (64.4 cm) and lowest (29.4 cm) for SCLY-5. The yellow corn had maximum (4.5 kg) grain yield at harvest as compared to sweet and popcorn (3.0 kg). Negative but weak correlation was recorded between ear height and grain yield. Cluster analysis based on yield related parameters grouped all the studied genotypes in to five sub clusters. Molecular genotyping based on four primers amplified 37 loci which were (100%) polymorphic. Maximum elven loci were identified by primer GLA-04, while minimum was reported for primer GLA-03. The loci GLD-18B1000, GLA-04B300 recorded highest gene diversity (0.500) followed by loci GLE-05B750, GLE-05B650 and GLE-05B550. The loci of primer GLD-18 (GLD-18B1000) detected highest alleles evenness and Simpson's diversity index of 1.00 and 0.526, respectively. Maximum gene diversity (0.354) among populations were recorded for yellow corn, while the minimum was detected for white corn (0.254), while genotypic diversity was same for all maize types. Cluster analysis based on molecular genotypic data grouped the maize genotypes into four distinct groups. Lack of concordance was observed while comparing the clustering based on phenotypic and molecular data. The overall diversity among the studied maize genotypes could be used in future maize breeding program.

This study aims at estimating richness, evenness and species diversity of woody plants in Arasbaran Protected Area (East Azerbaijan Province, Iran) using Landsat 8 OLI satellite images based on Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Classification and Regression Trees (CART) models. This study was performed in an elevation range of 1,000 - 1,850 m. A total of 130 samples were selected based on physiographic factors. In each sampling plot, number and type of dominant tree species in the canopy were recorded. Statistical modeling was carried out by calibrating MLR and CART models. The R-squared values of MLR models were in the range of 0.10 - 0.24 for predicting richness, evenness and Shannon and Simpson's species diversity indices based on greenness as the only predictor variable (other variables were excluded from MLR models). The R-squared values of CART models were equal to 0.21, 0.42, 0.41 and 0.42, respectively. Validation of the results indicated that the CART model had a relatively better performance compared to MLR model. Overall, both methods could not estimate species richness and diversity very precisely based on Landsat 8 OLI Satellite data in the region suggesting the necessity to use high-resolution satellite data for the best evaluation of forests diversity indices in mountainous forests.

The fishes collected in this study were netted from two collection points using bag nets. We also measured some environmental parameters during the time of netting. From the collection, we determined the Simpson's index of diversity (1-D), the Shannon-Wiener index (H), evenness (E) and the Sorenson's coefficient of community (CC) to find out the species richness, abundance, evenness and the levels of similarity of the two collection points. We also converted the H values to their true diversities (effective number of species [ENS]) for an adequate comparison. The indices and coefficient (H = 3.72-3.94, E = 0.830-0.832, 1-D = 0.973-0.979 and CC = 0.87) indicate that the overall integrity of biodiversity of the two collecting points is high. From the true diversity values, we ascertained that the first point, having 62 species of fishes, is 1.24 times as diverse as the second one, having 50 species. We have attributed the fish diversity to a compound of abiotic and biotic factors, which we explain in the discussion part. We also documented 20 fish species, new records for the Indian Sundarbans; some are new records from West Bengal. Furthermore, we discuss the possible reasons for their occurrence. Our study brings the number of fish species recorded from the Indian Sundarbans to 378.

In this paper, a spatial method for the assessment of the geodiversity of Basilicata region in southern Italy is proposed through the use of fragmentation indexes. The fragmentation indices use the values derived from the overlay of three different maps: i) landform map; ii) climate map; iii) geological map. Three indexes have been applied to obtain the geodiversity of the study area: i) Shannon's diversity index (SHDI); ii) Shannon's Evenness Index (SHEI); iii) Simpson's Diversity Index (SIDI). The results show how the three indices offer similar results. High values of geodiversity can be observed: i) in the frontal sector of the chain; ii) where the complexity of the landscape forms is high. Low values of geodiversity are observed in the Ionian coast belt. These results can represent a basic but valuable tool for the delineation of the main macro-areas with different geodiversity values.

The field research design employed a stratified random sampling method and was conducted in two phases. Phase 1 included the survey, identification and distribution of the pteridophyte flora and Phase 2 was to study the diversity of the extant pteridophytes throughout the KNP using seven transects. The region exhibited rich and highly diverse (Shannon-Wiener Diversity Index of 3.38), non-homogenous (compared to normal Raunkiaer's frequency curve) stand of 46 different unevenly (evenness index 0.64) distributed pteridophyte flora. The study region was dominated by two unambiguous pteridophyte species of weedy nature (Pteridium aquilinum and Dicranopteris linearis), with a high Simpson's dominance index of 0.96. The study reports eight endemic, two rare, five at risk and seven vulnerable and near-threatened IUCN listed pteridophyte species in the study region. The quantitative diversity indices i.e. frequency, density, abundance, relative abundance and important value index of each extant pteridophyte is calculated. The study also noted that some endemic species such as Osmunda huegeliana and Cyathea nilgirensis present in KNP needed immediate conservation efforts. This study gives an extensive report on the extant pteridophyte flora of KNP and will help future taxonomic surveys and research, as well as conservation and sustenance measures.

IOP					Indirect effect of pesticides utilization towards diversity of pollinator insects in chili plantation								IOP Conference Series-Materials Science and Engineering				1098						052054	10.1088/1757-899X/1098/5/052054			2021	2021	The contribution of insect pollinators to the ecology and production of food crops is threatened by excessive use of pesticides. Pesticides have an impact on reducing the presence of pollinators in agricultural land. The diversity of pollinators depends on food availability and habitat quality. This research emphasizes the diversity of insect pollinators by the application of pesticides in chili plantations in Muaro Jambi, Sumatra. Insect observations were conducted on April-May 2018 using the scan sampling method. Specimen collection is carried out from 08.00-16.00. Data analysis used Shannon-wiener diversity index (H '), Simpson's index (D), and Pielou evenness index (E). The results of the study were 498 collected individuals consisting of 9 species. Apis melifera, Apis cerana, and Eurema hecabe are the most dominant insect pollinators. Whereas Apis mellifera showed two peaks of flower visitation (an intense first one between 08.00 until 11.00 a.m. and a second less intense one after 14.00 p.m.). Pollinator insect diversity index in the medium category. Our observations also show that the application of pesticides, anthesis and dehiscence to flowers as well as the activity of pollinating insects which together cause low diversity index values.

In this study we collected and analyzed seasonal samples of phytoplankton and assessed environmental variables in Nansi Lake from 2011 to 2015, in order to identify the seasonal dynamics of the phytoplankton community and the main drivers in each phylum. The results showed that phytoplankton diversity in Nansi Lake followed annual cycles, which were interrupted by a water diversion in 2013. The disruption of equilibrium was clearly demonstrated by the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou's evenness index, and Simpson's dominance index, whereas the species richness and abundance showed resilience, maintaining regular annual cycles. The dominant species were frequently Synedra acus Kutz (Bacillariophyta), Closterium gracile Breb (Chlorophyta), and Scenedesmus quadricauda Breb (Chlorophyta) in summer and autumn. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis suggested that the phytoplankton was most widely distributed in summer, when conditions were more conducive to phytoplankton growth and reproduction. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the main drivers for the phytoplankton community varied in different taxonomic units. Specifically, the NP ratio and permanganate index (CODMn) had significant effects on Chlorophyta, whereas pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and transparency significantly influenced Bacillariophyta. This study highlights the importance of seasonal phytoplankton succession and the need for identification of the main drivers in each phylum in order to achieve more effective control of phytoplankton blooms in freshwater lakes.

The research was conducted in the Himalayan moist temperate forest. The research site was divided based on the silvicultural system (group selection system and single-tree selection system) into 148 plots and 150 plots, respectively. The group selection system was examined on the site of 2 ha which was clear-felled under a project in the 1980's. The present study examined the impact of silvicultural systems on regeneration. The frequency table was used, and relative frequency was calculated for the species and silvicultural system, density per m 2 was also calculated. Diversity indices were calculated through taxa, dominance, Simpson's index, Shannon index, evenness, equitability, and fisher alpha. Ten taxa were found in both silvicultural systems, with individual repetition of 17 and 15 taxa, respectively. Group selection is more compact visibly as compared to the single-tree selection system. The single-tree selection system is more diversified in species composition, stand structure, moisture availability, and less humus availability. The study also highlights future predictions for the conservation of these forests, which are highly sensitive and a hotspot for wildlife and climate change phenomena. Silvicultural practices such as silvicultural system, cleaning, weeding, thinning operations are regularly practiced, which can reduce the negative impact on these productive forests.

The aim of our study was to assess the colonic microbiota structure according to the metabolic control in T1DM patients treated with insulin pumps. We studied 89 T1DM patients (50.6% women) at the median age of 25 (IQR, 22-29) years. Pielou's evenness (p = 0.02), and Shannon's (p = 0.04) and Simpson's diversity indexes (p = 0.01), were higher in patients with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) >= 53 mmol/mol (7%). There were no differences in beta diversity between groups. A linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) algorithm showed that one family (Ruminococcaceae) was enriched in patients with HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol, whereas one family (Streptococcaceae) and four species (Ruminococcus torques, unclassified species of Lactococcus, Eubacteroim dolichum, and Coprobacillus cateniformis) were enriched in patients with HbA1c >= 53 mmol/mol. We found that at class level, the following pathways according to Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were enriched in patients with HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol: bacterial motility proteins, secretion system, bacterial secretion system, ribosome biogenesis, translation proteins, and lipid biosynthesis, whereas in patients with HbA1c >= 53 mmol/mol, the galactose metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, phosphotransferase system, fructose, and mannose metabolism were enriched. Observed differences in alpha diversity, metabolic pathways, and associations between bacteria and HbA1c in colonic flora need further investigation.

In the present study, we investigated the effectiveness of airborne laser scanner (ALS) and digital aerial photogrammetry (DAP) data for modeling tree diversity indices using machine learning algorithms in the uneven-aged Hyrcanian forests of Iran. Systematic sampling was adopted for the collection of field data on 300 circular plots (0.1 ha) in the study area. Menhenick, Margalef, Simpson's heterogeneity, reciprocal of Simpson's heterogeneity, Shanon-Winer heterogeneity and Simpson's evenness indices were computed as measures of tree species diversity for each plot. Several commonly used variables were extracted from the ALS and DAP data. The results showed that the random forests (RF) algorithm produced the greatest accuracy among all machine learning algorithms. Additionally, combining ALS and DAP (ALS thorn DAP) data increased prediction accuracy compared to separate modeling (0.2-6.6% reduction in relative root mean square error). The smallest RMSE% values based on independent validation data for Menhenick, Margalef, Simpson's, reciprocal of Simpson's, Shanon-Winer heterogeneity and Simpson's evenness indices were 34.6%, 32.2%, 27.6%, 27.4%, 30.7% and 24.4%, respectively. These results demonstrate that the combination of ALS and DAP could be useful for monitoring tree species diversity in multistory stands in the north of Iran and likely also in forests with complex canopy structures and multiple tree species.

However, little is known about how increasing salinity level will affect the entire zooplankton community on a large scale. Here we completed 1 year of field investigations on the Pearl River Estuary and analyzed the distribution and structure of the zooplankton community. A total of 68 zooplankton species were identified during the survey. The number and diversity (richness, evenness, Shannon index, and Simpson's index) of the zooplankton species decreased as salinity increased from 0.10 to 21.26. Salinity negatively affected the abundances of rotifers, cladocerans, and total zooplankton, while it had little effect on copepod abundance. Some salt-tolerant species, such as Keratella tropica, Polyarthra vulgaris, and Paracalanus crassirostris, survived at high-salinity sites. A pattern was observed at all sites: the peak in copepod abundance always occurred when rotifers were abundant (sites S1 and S2) or after rotifer abundance reached a maximum level (sites S3, S4, and S5). In general, salinity was the most important environmental factor shaping zooplankton biodiversity and abundance. This study provides insight into potential biodiversity and structure of the zooplankton community in response to salinity change.

A survey was carried out in four Local Government Areas (LGAs) of Lagos State, Nigeria for one year to determine the abundance, diversity, and larval habitat characteristics of mosquito. Larvae were collected using WHO standard methods, the physiochemical characteristics of the habitats were recorded, the larvae were reared to adults and identified using morphological identification keys and molecular assays. Adult mosquitoes were also collected outdoor using a trap with octanol attractant. Five species belonging to 3 genera were collected and identified as Anopheles gambiae complex, Anopheles furies tus complex, Culex quinquefasciatus, Aedes aegypti, and Aedes albopictus. Cx quinquefasciatus (37.7%) is the most abundant followed by Ae aegypti (31.3%) and An. gambiae s.l. (26.9%) while Ae. albopictus (1.9%) is the least abundant. The larval abundance within the different species showed a high level of statistical significance (P<0.001). Simpson's index was found to range from 0.6751 to 0.6926 for all the sampled locations while the Shannon index ranges from 1.187 to 1.242 and Evenness ranges from 0.6566 to 0.7134. The average physiochemical parameter of the water bodies harboring the mosquito larvae includes pH ranging from 7.2 +/- 0.1 to 7.7 +/- 0.2, Conductivity ranging from 0.35 +/- 0.2 to 0.83 +/- 0.46, temperature ranging from 28.7 +/- 0.65 to 31.3 +/- 0.71, and TDS ranging from 330 +/- 158.4 to 571.5 +/- 320. An increase in the global temperature as a result of climate change could have an effect on temperature and other physiochemical parameters of mosquito larval habitats, thereby altering the duration of their metamorphosis, subsequently an upsurge in adult mosquito abundance leading potential outbreak of mosquito-borne diseases.

J	Kopij, Grzegorz								Changes in the structure of avian community along a moisture gradient in an urbanized tropical riparian forest								POLISH JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				68	3			251	262		10.3161/15052249PJE2020.68.3.006			NOV 2020	2020	In larger river valleys of southern Africa, riparian forests are among the main vegetation types. The forests are regarded as ones of the most diverse and distinct terrestrial habitats on earth. They also play a crucial role in wildlife conservation as corridors and refugia for wildlife. It is hypothesized that the closer to the river bank, the higher the species diversity, while population densities may increase with the increase of the distance from the river bank. In 2014, quantitative studies (by means of the mapping method) on avian community breeding in such forest on Zambezi River in Katima Mulilo were undertaken to measure this gradient. Four plots were designed along an increasing distance from the river bank in this forest. In terms of the number of species, there was a significant gradual decrease with the increasing distance from the bank (from 91 to 54 species). The number of breeding pairs per 100 ha increased with the moisture gradient (from 222 to 677). Shannon's (H') and Simpson's (D) indices were higher in the two plots closer to the bank river (H'= 3.44-3.85; D = 0.97-0.99), than in the two remaining plots (H' = 3.13-3.15; D = 0.92-0.93). Also the Pielou's Evenness Index was higher in two plots closer to the bank (J' = 0.84-0.85 vs. 0.77-0.78). The proportion of granivores in the avian community declined along the moisture gradient, while that of insectivores and frugivores - increased. These gradual changes can be linked to a parallel gradual changes of the amount of fruits and invertebrates.

J	Fang, Haiyan								Impact of land use changes on catchment soil erosion and sediment yield in the northeastern China: A panel data model application								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SEDIMENT RESEARCH				35	5			540	549		10.1016/j.ijsrc.2020.03.017			OCT 2020	2020	Land use is an important factor influencing soil erosion and sediment yield (SESY). Regressing soil erosion intensity (SEI) and sediment yield (SY) to land use characteristics can provide necessary information for controlling soil loss. However, current simple regression methods emphasize cross sectional parameters, with less emphasis on temporal variability of relevant land use parameters so that the derived effects of land use change on SESY can be biased. Here, a panel data method was applied to quantify the impact of land use change on SESY in 1954, 1975, and 2015, based on the WaTEM/SEDEM model and seven landscape metrics for 25 reservoir catchments in northeastern China. The results indicate that SEI and area-specific SY (SSY) continuously decreased from 1954 to 2015, which were significantly correlated with landscape metrics such as area-edge metrics of mean patch area (AREA_MN), shape index of the mean related circumscribing circle (CIRCLE_MN), aggregation index of effective mesh size (MESH), patch cohesion index (COHESION), and diversity metrics such as Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), patch richness density (PRD), and modified Simpson's evenness index (MSIEI). The results suggested that catchment SESY can be reduced through decreasing mean patch area, patch mesh size, and physical connectivity of patches, enriching landscape types, and elongating land use patches. These findings are helpful to effectively implement soil conservation measures in northeastern China and similar regions worldwide. The current study also implies that the panel data approach will have beneficial potential applications in earth-science research fields.

Endosulfan was sprayed indiscriminately in large plantations of Kasaragod district, Kerala which had caused serious threats to the ecosystem. In this study, we surveyed the butterflies for their abundance and diversity in three differentially endosulfan-affected areas viz., Enmakaje-highly affected area, Periye-moderately affected area, Padanakkad-unaffected area, carried out between the end of the monsoon season and the start of the winter season, lasting approximately 100 days. Seven variables viz., butterfly abundance (N), species richness (S), Simpson's reciprocal index (D), the Shannon-Wiener index (H), the exponential of the Shannon-Wiener index (expH), Pielou's evenness (J) and species evenness (D/S), related to species diversity were estimated, followed by the one-way ANOVA (F = 25.01, p < 0.001) and the Kruskal-Wallis test (H = 22.59, p < 0.001). Results: A population of three different butterfly assemblages comprised of 2300 butterflies which represented 61 species were encountered. Our results showed that Enmakaje displayed significantly lower butterfly diversity and abundance, compared to the other two communities. Conclusion: So far, this is the first study concerning the effect of endosulfan on the biodiversity of butterfly in the affected areas of Kasaragod, Kerala, India. This study may present an indirect assessment of the persisting effects of endosulfan in the affected areas, suggesting its long-term effects on the ecosystem.		[Raghavendra, K.

Plant diversity and botanical composition in an Atlantic heather-gorse dominated understory after horse grazing suspension: Comparison of a continuous and rotational management								GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION				23						e01134	10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01134			SEP 2020	2020	Floristic diversity changes substantially depending on the type of land management. We evaluated the impact of a continuous (CG) and rotational (RG) grazing system on the dynamics of plant diversity and community composition in a heather-gorse understory after a two and six-year pause from horse grazing. Previously grazed sites had higher total and rare species richness and diversity than ungrazed (UN), regardless the type of grazing system. The positive impact of previous grazing on species richness was higher in CG and continued after six years in both grazing systems. Seven species of high conservation interest in heathlands were present in the studied areas. Most of them were associated to CG management and none was exclusively in RG. The reduction of the shrub component by previous horse grazing led to a decrease of gorse dominance, thus potentially reducing fire risk and increasing plant diversity. The extent of the positive effect of horse grazing controlling excessive accumulation of combustible material and favoring species richness differed when relative abundance of species, and not solely the number of species, was taken into account (Simpson's dominance increased and Pielou's evenness decreased after six years). Overall, the effects of previous rotational and continuous grazing on plant diversity in an Atlantic heather-gorse dominated plant community were still apparent 2 or 6 years after grazing interruption, although declined after the six-year grazing interlude. Rotational management revealed a slight advantage upon the control of gorse biomass long term, and assisted to maintain the relative abundance of species more evenly over time. The alpha and beta diversity indices confirmed that plant diversity similarity between rotational and continuous management increased after six years. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

J	Li, Wei; He, Shuqiang; Cheng, Xiping; Zhang, Gengxin								Short-term effects of experimental trampling on alpine grasslands in Shangri-la, China								GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND CONSERVATION				23						e01161	10.1016/j.gecco.2020.e01161			SEP 2020	2020	Alpine grasslands provide essential ecosystem functions and services, yet they are increasingly subject to anthropogenic perturbations. Northwest Yunnan (NWY) is one of the most popular tourist destinations in China, and alpine grasslands of NWY are particularly susceptible to human recreational activities such as hiker trampling. However, studies that explicitly evaluate the effects of trampling disturbance on alpine communities of NWY are very limited, let alone research testing the responses of these communities to trampling from a functional trait perspective. The present research is performed in alpine grasslands within and outside of a core nature conservation area of Shangri-La, NWY of China, to study speciesand community-level responses of alpine communities to simulated trampling through a functional trait-based approach. The results showed that although species-specific differences existed, alpine plants generally showed rapid morphological changes in response to trampling disturbance. At the community level, trampling disturbance caused strong shifts in taxonomy-based diversity metrics (e.g., species richness, Simpson's index and Shannon's index) and functional trait-based diversity metrics (e.g., functional richness, functional evenness, functional divergence, and community-weighted mean trait values). Specifically, increased trampling intensity led to a decrease in taxonomic diversity. Meanwhile, functional richness decreased, while functional evenness and functional divergence increased with an increase in trampling intensity. Also, characteristics of alpine community traits had changed towards those with shorter height, reduced leaf size and lower LDMC, and such strong shifts in taxonomic and functional diversity might further affect the functioning and value of alpine grasslands. Therefore, the protection of high-altitude natural grasslands with high sensitivity and vulnerability is urgent, especially as they are increasingly experiencing multiple environ mental and climatic stressors nowadays.

Methods The study sites were Dongjiu Bridge (DJ), Linji Bridge (LZ), and Birishen Mountain Scenic Spot (RB) in Gongbu Nature Reserve, Southeast Tibet, China. Species composition and distribution pattern of the underground seed bank inP.densataforest were analyzed. Germination data and field investigations were used to examine the similarities between aboveground vegetation and underground seed banks, and their responses to the environment. Results There were 47 species belonging to 27 families in the underground seed bank of theP. densataforest. Asteraceae, Rosaceae, Labiatae, and Poaceae were dominant, accounting for 40.4% of the total number of families. Underground seed density was 2,114, 1,952, and 1,141 seeds/m(2)in DJ, LZ, and BR, respectively. The percentage of different life-forms in each sampling location was shown to be perennial herbs > shrubs > annual herbs > trees > subshrubs. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Margalef richness index, and Simpson's dominance index of each sample showed that species decreased with higher elevation, while the Pielou evenness index showed the opposite trend. Elevation, slope position, slope aspect, and slope were positively correlated with the Pielou evenness index and negatively correlated with the Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Margalef richness index, and Simpson's dominance index. The Sorensen index, comparing the similarity between the underground seed bank and aboveground vegetation of DJ, LZ, and BR was 0.46, 0.35, and 0.31, respectively. Conclusion The underground seed bank ofP. densataforest has high seed density and high species richness, but there was little similarity between aboveground vegetation and underground seed bank. Elevation and slope position had a great influence on the uniformity of species distribution.

Variety of gastropods biodiversity associated with natural and anthropogenic factors in Mangrove Forests located at border of Iran and Pakistan								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				18	4			989	996		10.1007/s13762-020-02887-7			APR 2021	2021	This research was conducted to evaluate the gastropods diversity in mangrove forests located in Iranian part of the Govater Gulf in southern border of Iran and Pakistan. Three transects were selected at the water interface vertically to the end of forest stand. In each transect, samples of sediments containing gastropods were taken at the beginning (lower zones), the middle, and the end (upper zone) points during four continued seasons. Biodiversity (Shannon-Wiener index), dominance (Simpson's dominance index), species evenness (Smith and Wilson evenness index), richness (number of species), and density (number in m(3)) were calculated for each season in sampling points. Data analysis results showed that biodiversity and richness indices changed significantly among different transects. Shannon-Wiener diversity index in transect one (1.90 +/- 0.69) was significantly higher than transect two (1.26 +/- 0.67) and three (1.19 +/- 0.68). Similarly, richness index was the highest in transect one (7.58 +/- 1.53) rather than transect two (4.42 +/- 1.15) and three (3.92 +/- 0.94). Density index changed differently between lower zone (2318.02 +/- 987.76), middle zone (2318.01 +/- 605.75) and upper zone (13,420.71 +/- 176.50). Species evenness showed significant differences between lower (0.65 +/- 0.15) to middle (0.46 +/- 0.20) and upper (0.30 +/- 0.32) zones. Different seasons had no significant effect on richness, density, diversity, and evenness of gastropod species. Consequently, among the natural factors, it is the intertidal zones which increases the environmental stresses such as salinity and humidity was considered, and surprisingly, weak anthropogenic factors, for example, the effect of the transect was positive due to providing nutrient.

J	Klass, Keren; Van Belle, Sarie; Campos-Villanueva, Alvaro; Malabet, Fernando Mercado; Estrada, Alejandro								Effects of variation in forest fragment habitat on black howler monkey demography in the unprotected landscape around Palenque National Park, Mexico								PEERJ				8						e9694	10.7717/peerj.9694			AUG 10 2020	2020	Habitat loss and fragmentation are leading threats to biodiversity today, and primates are particularly vulnerable to anthropogenic habitat disturbance. However, few studies have examined how differential effects of variation in forest fragment characteristics on males and females in a primate population may affect demography and population persistence. We quantified the effects of variation in forest fragment characteristics on the within-fragment demography of black howler monkeys (Alouatta pigra) in forest fragments around Palenque National Park, Mexico, and how these effects differed between adult males and females. We quantified forest loss in the landscape between 2000 and 2017, and used a redundancy analysis to examine the effects of 15 variables quantifying fragment dimensions, forest composition and physical structure, and isolation on fragment population size and density, the proportion of adult males and females in the fragment population, and the mean number of adult males and females per group in 34 fragments (N = 393 monkeys). We hypothesized that (i) population size is positively correlated with fragment area, while population density is negatively correlated, and (ii) the composition of fragment populations results from differential effects of fragment variables on adult males and females. Forest cover decreased by 23.3% from 2000 to 2017. Our results showed a significant effect of fragment variables on population demography in fragments, accounting for 0.69 of the variance in the demographic response variables. Population size increased with fragment area and connectivity, while density decreased. Larger, less isolated fragments with better connectivity, characteristics indicative of abundant secondary growth, and those with more diverse vegetation but lower Simpson's evenness indices tended to have more adult females per group and a higher proportion of adult females in the population. In contrast, fragments that were largely similar in characteristics of forest composition and structure, but that were more isolated from nearby fragments, had more adult males per group and a higher proportion of adult males. These results may stem from black howler females preferentially remaining in natal groups and fragments when possible, and dispersing shorter distances when they disperse, while males may be more likely to disperse between fragments, traveling longer distances through the matrix to more isolated fragments. These differential effects on males and females have important conservation implications: if females are more abundant in larger, less isolated fragments, while males are more abundant in more isolated fragments, then to effectively conserve this population, both landscape connectivity and fragment areas should be maintained and increased.

A comparative analysis of the data type's diversity indicators for physical database schemes showed that the values of some indices obey certain rules. It is proposed to use diversity indices for physical database schemes' qualitative assessment.

Summer Ichthyoplankton Assemblage Diversity Within a Southeastern United States Estuary								ESTUARIES AND COASTS				44	1			253	268		10.1007/s12237-020-00777-2			JAN 2021	2021	We evaluated spatial, short-term, and decadal-scale variability in the summer ichthyoplankton assemblages within the North Inlet-Winyah Bay estuarine system, Georgetown County, South Carolina, USA. Ichthyoplankton were collected weekly from late May to early September 2016 on nighttime flood tides using a 1-m diameter, 1-mm mesh plankton net at three sites of varying salinity and proximity to inlets. Nearly 30,000 fishes representing 59 taxa were collected from all three sites over the 14-week study period. Gobiidae andAnchoaspp. dominated the overall community, composing between 69 and 94% of the total catch at each of the three sites. Weekly densities of all taxa combined did not vary between sites, yet diversity metrics (richness, evenness, Shannon-Weiner index, and Simpson's index) were greatest at the highest salinity site, and overall assemblage composition significantly varied among sites. Non-metric multidimensional scaling suggested a shift in the assemblage at all sites corresponding to an increase in water temperature throughout the summer. Differences in family-level assemblage composition between this study and previous work from the 1980s were detected, differences which may be indicative of regional-scale environmental change. Overall, the summer ichthyoplankton assemblages resembled those from other estuaries along the southeastern US Atlantic coast and temperate regions worldwide, generally dominated by a few taxa and composed of a mixture of estuarine-, estuarine and nearshore-, and continental shelf-spawning taxa.

To understand the AMF status of mango cultivars in Typic Quartzipsamments soil, experiments were carried out in the mango orchard located at College of Agriculture, Padannakkad, Kerala Agricultural University. Five improved varieties and two hybrid varieties of mango were selected for AMF analysis. All the varieties selected for the study exhibited AMF root colonization, arbuscules and inter or intracellular vesicles. A total of ten AMF species belonging to five genera viz. Acaulospora, Gigaspora, Claroideoglomus, Glomus and Sclerocystis were isolated. Among the species identified, four species were of Glomus, two species of Claroideoglomus and Sclerocystis and one species each of Acaulospora and Gigaspora. The Simpson's index, Shannon index and evenness ranged from 0.80 +/- 0.020 to 85 +/- 0.02; 1.89 +/- 0.03 to 2.09 +/- 0.06; 0.74 +/- 0.02 to 0.84 +/- 0.04, respectively. The spore count showed a significant negative correlation with percentage of root colonization. There was no correlation observed with soil phosphorus content. These results revealed that arbuscular mycorrhizas are an important constituent in mango orchard and the high spore density and root colonization were most likely a selective adaptation toward sandy loam soil. All the species or each one of the species appeared to be generalists in Indian soil.		[Govindan, M.; Rajeshkumar, P. P.; Varma, C. K. Yamini; Anees, M. Mohamed; Rashmi, C.

Parchin-Pasdaran Road, which runs from the heart of Khojir National Park, is a big threat to this park. Despite these environmental threats, the development and creation of new highways is unavoidable. This research was carried out to study the effect of the road on Smith-Wilson evenness index and Simpson diversity index in Khojir National Park. The Land Management Units were created using the ArcGIS software. Using appropriate algorithm in artificial neural network structure and linear regression of species evenness and diversity was modelled. For modelling of species evenness and diversity, factors like bulk density, particle density, moisture content, porosity and distance from the road were used. Finally, considering that the amount of R-2 in artificial neural network method was statistically significant for Smith-Wilson and Simpson (0.54), (0.71) and in the regression method, respectively (0.25), (0.75), was obtained, the neural network model was selected as the optimal model. Based on the analysis of sensitivity analysis, humidity factors at 5 and 10 cm from the soil surface, the actual 5 cm particle density on the Smith-Wilson index and the porosity at 10 cm from the soil surface had the most effect on the Russian Simpson index.

This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in five hospitals of the Hormozgan province, of southern Iran. Adult flies were collected by bottle fly traps. Specimens were pinned and morphologically identified using the relevant keys. Species biodiversity indices including Menhinick (M), Shannon-Wiener (H'), Pielou's Evenness (E), and Simpson's diversity (D) were calculated. Totally 2,298 individuals of 18 species of flies belonging to nine genera and four families were collected. Chrysomya megacephala was the most frequent species (37.3%), followed by Chrysoma albiceps (24.8%), Fannia canicularis (5.1%), Musca domestica (4.8%), Sarcophaga aegyptica (3.7%), and 15 other species (24.4%). Our results show a high diversity and abundance of domestic filth flies in the studied hospitals. Relatively similar data derived from various hospitals in this study can show the uniformity in sanitary conditions of hospitals. On the other hand, estimation of diversity indices alarmed for potential of dominant species in fly communities in hospital environments.

Effect of stocking density and effective fiber on the ruminal bacterial communities in lactating Holstein cows								PEERJ				8						e9079	10.7717/peerj.9079			APR 29 2020	2020	Overstocking can be a major issue in the dairy cattle industry, leading to negative changes in feeding and resting behavior. Additional stress imposed and alterations in feeding behavior may significantly impact the rumen microbiome. The rumen microbiome is responsible for the successful conversion of feed to usable energy for its host. Thus, understanding the effects of stocking density on the rumen microbiome is imperative for further elucidation of potentially negative consequences of overstocking in dairy cattle. This study implemented a Latin Square design accounting for four pens of cattle and four treatment periods so that all treatment combinations were assigned to every pen during one period of the study. Two treatment factors, including two levels of physically effective neutral detergent fiber, achieved with addition of chopped straw, and stocking density (100% vs. 142%) of freestalls and headlocks, were combined and tested within a factorial treatment design. Within each pen, three or four cannulated cows (n = 15 total) were sampled for rumen content on the final day of each treatment period. Each treatment was randomly assigned to a single pen for a 14-day period. The V1-V3 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene were targeted for bacterial analyses. Variables with approximately normally-distributed residuals and a Shapiro-Wilk statistic of >= 0.85 were analyzed using a mixed model analysis of variance with the GLIMMIX procedure with fixed effects of feed (straw vs. no straw), stocking density (100% vs. 142%), and the interaction of feed x stocking density, and random effects of pen, period, feed x stocking x pen x period. Pen was included as the experimental unit in a given period and the sampling unit as cow. Variables included Shannon's Diversity Index, Faith's phylogenetic diversity index, chao1, observed OTU, and Simpson's evenness E as well as most individual taxa. Data were analyzed in SAS 9.4 utilizing the GLIMMIX procedure to perform mixed model analysis of variance. If data were not normally distributed, a ranked analysis was performed. No differences were observed in a-diversity metrics by fiber or stocking density (P > 0.05). Beta diversity was assessed using weighted and unweighted Unifrac distances in QIIME 1.9.1 and analyzed using ANOSIM. No differences were observed in weighted (P = 0.6660; R = -0.0121) nor unweighted (P = 0.9190; R = - 0.0261) metrics and R values suggested similar bacterial communities among treatments. At the phylum level, Tenericutes differed among treatments with an interaction of stocking density by feed (P = 0.0066). At the genus level, several differences were observed by treatment, including Atopobium (P = 0.0129), unidentified members of order RF39 (P = 0.0139), and unidentified members of family Succinivibrionaceae (P = 0.0480). Although no diversity differences were observed, taxa differences may indicate that specific taxa are affected by the treatments, which may, in turn, affect animal production.

The results showed that the vegetation in this area was mainly in four succession stages: grassland, shrub grassland, shrub forest and arbour forest. There were also some artificial fruit-bearing forests. In summary, 97 families, 230 genera and 382 species were investigated and recorded in the studied region. The predominant three families with the largest number of species were the Rosaceae, Compositae and Poaceae. The percentage of the life forms as arbour, shrub, herb and rattan accounted for 14.66%, 29.84%, 43.46% and 11.52% of the total species, respectively. The species richness index and Simpson's diversity index were as follows: arbour forest> shrub forest> shrub grassland > fruit-bearing forest> grassland. The species evenness and Shannon-Wiener index were as follows: arbour forest > shrub forest > shrub grassland > grass > fruit-bearing forest. In different stages of vegetation succession in the karst area, the measures taken for the restoration of vegetation and afforestation should be based on the specific species.

Microhabitats are associated with diversity-productivity relationships in freshwater bacterial communities								FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY				96	4					fiaa029	10.1093/femsec/fiaa029			APR 2020	2020	Eukaryotic communities commonly display a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function (BEF) but the results have been mixed when assessed in bacterial communities. Habitat heterogeneity, a factor in eukaryotic BEFs, may explain these variable observations but it has not been thoroughly evaluated in bacterial communities. Here, we examined the impact of habitat on the relationship between diversity assessed based on the (phylogenetic) Hill diversity metrics and heterotrophic productivity. We sampled co-occurring free-living (more homogenous) and particle-associated (more heterogeneous) bacterial habitats in a freshwater, estuarine lake over three seasons: spring, summer and fall. There was a strong, positive, linear relationship between particle-associated bacterial richness and heterotrophic productivity that strengthened when considering dominant taxa. There were no observable BEF trends in free-living bacterial communities for any diversity metric. Biodiversity, richness and Inverse Simpson's index, were the best predictors of particle-associated production whereas pH was the best predictor of free-living production. Our findings show that heterotrophic productivity is positively correlated with the effective number of taxa and that BEF relationships are associated with microhabitats. These results add to the understanding of the highly distinct contributions to diversity and functioning contributed by bacteria in free-living and particle-associated habitats.

Metal engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) that gain entry into these environments may alter the composition and activities of resident natural bacterial communities. To assess changes in community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of microbial communities in soils exposed to metal ENMs, Biolog EcoPlates were used in this exploratory comparative study. The CLPP is a rapid screening technique to characterise functional differences among heterotrophic microbial communities based on variable substrate utilization. The impacts of three metal ENMs, silver, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, on bacterial communities were investigated using three soil types from Maharashtra, India. Metabolic diversity of bacterial communities was impacted in the soils in presence of silver and zinc oxide, but not in presence of titanium dioxide nanoparticles. Diversity indices, viz., Shannon's index, Evenness index and Simpson's index also showed significant differences in the presence of silver and zinc oxide nanoparticles.

Many previous methods have been proposed for this task. However, previous methods do not explicitly consider the uniformity of the number of the items' classes, or evenness, which could degrade the search and recommendation quality. To address this problem, we introduce a novel method by adapting the Simpson's Diversity Index from biology, which enables a more effective and efficient quadratic search result diversification algorithm. We also extend the method to balance the diversity between multiple aspects through weighted factors and further improve computational complexity by developing a fast approximation algorithm. We demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method using the openly available Kaggle shoes competition dataset. Our experimental results show that our approach outperforms previous state of the art diversification methods, while reducing computational complexity.

Weed control efficiency and productivity in rice-fish-duck integrated farming system								INDIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES				67	3			62	71		10.21077/ijf.2020.67.3.94309-07			2020	2020	Rice farming integrated with fish and ducks potentially provides ecological services and supports effective management of weeds which cause rice yield losses due to growth competitiveness with the available resources and productivity. Present study investigated the efficacy of integrating fish and duck in rice farming for controlling weed infestations and their impacts on productivity and economics of the system. Appraisal on diversity of weeds indicated that grassy weeds (Echinochola colona, Echinochola crusgalli) and sedges (Cyperus difformis, Cyperus iria, Fimbristylis miliacea) were prevalent in rice during tillering stages, while broad leaf weeds (Ludwigia adscendens, Sphenoclea zeylanica) and aquatic weeds (Marsilia quadrifolia, Otellia alismoides, Vallisneria spiralis, Limnophila indica, Ceratophyllum demersum, Hydrilla verticillata) were abundant during active tillering and panicle initiation stages of rice. A significant reduction in weed density and weed biomass was observed in rice-fish (RF), rice-duck (RD) and rice-fish-duck (RFD) integration. However, weed control efficiency (WCE %) was significantly (p<0.05) higher in RFD. The weed biodiversity in terms of species richness (Simpson's index) and species diversity (Shannon-Wiener index) decreased significantly, while Pielou evenness community index increased in RFD, signifying weed community composition was highly diversified with reduction of formerly dominant weed species. Rice agronomic characteristics, productivity and economic returns were higher in integrated system indicating over all improvements in ecology and productivity. Better growth of fishes accrued with RFD integrated system, possibly, due to the better nutrient availability. Thus, fish and duck can be used as biocontrol agents for weed management in rice farming for enhancing productivity in areas where application of chemical herbicides may be partially or totally eliminated in transplanted lowland system.

The dominant trees create specific character habitat and be prefered of termites to inhabited under them. The aims of this research to differ the preference of termites to habitat under the tree on western Slope. The method used was a survey with sampling based on belt transect.(L=100m, W=2m) layed under both habitats for 600 m length. Each transect for 100 m length divided into 20 sections, then the termites sampled on a living tree, branch, bark, litter, and soil in each section. Diversity, equality, and domination of termites were analyzed by Shannon-Wienner index (H'), Shannon-Evenness index (E), and Simpson's Domination index and correlation test. The result, six species of termites Schedorhinotermes javanicus, Odontotermes javanicus, Nasutitermes matangensis, Capritermes semarangi, Procapritermes stiger, and Microtermes insperatus were found under both of the trees. The pattern of abundance of each species termites on altitudes showed maximal on mid altitudes. The conclusion was the preference of termites to the dominant tree was significantly different, the termites diversity was categorized as low level, and the most dominant species was Schedorhinotermes javanicus.

Impact of Nypa Palm (<i>Nypa fruticans</i> Wurmb) and Mangroves Forest on Benthic Macro Invertebrate Community in Andoni River, Nigeria								INTERNATIONAL LETTERS OF NATURAL SCIENCES				77				51	62		10.18052/www.scipress.com/ILNS.77.51			2020	2020	It is postulated that the presence of nypa palm (Nypa palm) in mangrove forest affect the reproductive function of fish by inhibiting the growth of macro invertebrates. The impact of Nypa fruticans (Wurmb) and mangroves on the benthic macro invertebrate community of Andoni River was carried out between January and August, 2017. A total of four stations were chosen based on nypa palm and native mangrove species' presence and absence, station 1 (Open water), Station 2 (Nypa palm dominance), station 3 (Rhizophora and Avicennia dominance), Station 4 (Mixed). Results of water quality parameters include; pH 6.99 +/- 0.16, Temperature 28.20 +/- 0.05 degrees C, DO 4.71 +/- 0.18mg/L, Conductivity 19.52 +/- 0.20 mu m/s, Salinity 10.76 +/- 0.07ppt, TDS 13.45 +/- 0.27ppt. Mean values of the physico-chemical parameters (P > 0.05) were not significantly different. Twelve taxa of benthic macro-invertebrates in eleven families were collected. The crustaceans were more in diversity (38.46%), while bivalvia, pisces and oligochaete had the least percentage composition (7.69%). The gastropods were more in species dominance (44.69%), while the Oligochaeta were least in abundance (0.61%). Shannon Weiner's index across the stations for benthos was highest in station 2 (1.840) and lowest in station 1 (1.103). Simpson's index was highest in station 2 (1.990) and lowest in station 1 (1.938). Pielou's index of evenness was highest in station 2 (0.767) and lowest in station 1 (0.616). All the macro-invertebrates recorded were clean water and pollution tolerant species, and showed no significant difference across stations (P>0.05). In conclusion this study indicates that nypa palm does not affect the proliferation of macro invertebrates, which supports fishery population along the food chain.		[Emoyoma, U. O.; Numbere, A.

A total of 16 fish species were recorded, belonging to 4 orders (Cypriniformes, Channiformes, Siluriformes and Mastacebilformes), and 5 families including Cyprinidae (Schizopyge esocinus, Racoma labiata, Cyprinion watsoni, Cyprinus carpio, Barilius pakistanicus, B. vagra, B. modestus, Crossocheilus diplocheilus, Garra gotyla, Puntius ticto, and P. sophore), Channidae (Channa punctatus and Channa gachua), Nemacheilidae (Schistura macrolepis), Sisoidae (Glyptothorax punjabensis), and Mastacembelidae (Mastacembelus armatus). Different ichthyo-diversity indices [Simpson's biodiversity index (D=0.918), Simpson's reciprocal index (1/D=1.088), Simpson's evenness index (E-1/D=0.068), species richness (S), Shannon-Weiner's index (H'=3.775), Menhinick's index (D-mn=0.804), and Margalef's index (D-mg=2.510)] were calculated for the stream. The physicochemical parameters [temperature (23.125 +/- 3.514 degrees C), dissolved Oxygen (9.003 +/- 0.627 mg L-1), pH (7.333 +/- 0.201), turbidity (76.5 +/- 6.403 NTU), electric conductivity (201.68 +/- 11.31 mu s cm(-1)), free CO2 (124.75 +/- 9.912 ppm), total dissolved solids (126.1 +/- 9.477 ppm), total alkalinity (4.325 +/- 0.171 mg L-1), total suspended solids (127.1 +/- 6.864 ppm), total hardness (5.225 +/- 0.341 mg L-1), salinity (42.25 +/- 6.292 ppt), calcium hardness (2.975 +/- 0.670 mg L-1), magnesium hardness (105 +/- 9.954 mg L-1), potassium (0.0145 +/- 0.001 mg L-1), sodium (16.55 +/- 3.861 mg L-1), chloride (1.825 +/- 0.727 mg L-1), and nitrate (0.053 +/- 0.006 mg L-1) level] were monitored and found to be in varying but permissible ranges. The stream was found to be harboring a number of economically valuable fish species. An exotic fish species, C. carpio, was found well flourished, indicating the potential of the stream to be used for mitigating the declining ichthyofaunal diversity in the main nearby rivers. Two species, P. sophore and P. ticto, were recorded for the first time from the district. Proper management, appropriate fish stocking, and implementing environmental/fishing laws are suggested for the maintenance of the diversity and alleviating anthropogenic stress/threats.

Experiments carried out with lichen- and moss-dominated biocrusts indicate that climate change may dramatically reduce their cover and diversity. Therefore, the development of reproducible methods to monitor changes in biocrust diversity and abundance across multiple spatio-temporal scales is key for evaluating how climate change may impact biocrust communities and the myriad of ecosystem functions and services that rely on them. In this study, we collected lichen-dominated biocrust samples from a semi-arid ecosystem in central Spain. Their alpha-diversity was then evaluated using very high spatial resolution hyperspectral images (pixel size of 0.091 mm) measured in laboratory under controlled conditions. Support vector machines were used to map the biocrust composition. Traditional alpha-diversity metrics (i.e., species richness, Shannon's, Simpson's, and Pielou's indices) were calculated using lichen fractional cover data derived from their classifications in the hyperspectral imagery. Spectral diversity was calculated at different wavelength ranges as the coefficient of variation of different regions of the reflectance spectra of lichens and as the standard deviation of the continuum removal algorithm (SD_CR). The accuracy of the classifications of the images obtained was close to 100%. The results showed the best coefficient of determination (r(2) = 0.47) between SD_CR calculated at 680 nm and the alpha-diversity calculated as the Simpson's index, which includes species richness and their evenness. These findings indicate that this spectral diversity index could be used to track spatio-temporal changes in lichen-dominated biocrust communities. Thus, they are the first step to monitor alpha-diversity of biocrust-forming lichens at the ecosystem and regional levels, a key task for any program aiming to evaluate changes in biodiversity and associated ecosystem services in drylands.

The nematicide fluensulfone was registered in several countries for the control of the root-knot nematodes, Meloidogyne spp. among other plant-parasitic nematodes. This study aimed to evaluate the nematicidal activity of fluensulfone against non-target nematode fauna in four field experiments, each under different conditions (soils types and plant hosts). Nematodes extracted from soil samples were classified and counted based on their morphological characters. Fluensulfone significantly reduced damage caused by root-knot nematodes to tomato and sweet potato plants, while overall non-target free-living nematode population densities were maintained at the same level as those in control. Different diversity indices (e.g., Shannon-Wiener H', Simpson's D, species richness, evenness J', maturity indices) and principal component analyses in the four experiments showed that fluensulfone treatment kept a similar diversity level of non-target free-living nematode fauna to that of the non-treated control. The results suggested that fluensulfone may have minimal impact to free-living nematode fauna in both population density and diversity when the nematicide was applied to control Meloidogyne spp.		[Kawanobe, Masanori; Toyota, Koki; Fujita, Tomonori] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Grad Sch Bioapplicat & Syst Engn, Koganei, Tokyo 1848588, Japan; [Kawanobe, Masanori] AgriRAND, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130022, Japan; [Hatta, Daisuke] ADAMA JAPAN KK, Minato Ku, Tokyo 1050003, Japan; [Kawanobe, Masanori] Tokyo Univ Agr & Technol, Grad Sch Bioapplicat & Syst Engn, Koganei, Tokyo 1848588, Japan; [Kawanobe, Masanori] AgriRAND, Bunkyo Ku, Tokyo 1130022, Japan								8							Agronomy; Plant Sciences	WOS:000507280400105

Water Quality Index (WQI) is used to identify the adverse effects of water quality on species diversity, richness, and evenness of the aquatic community. Physicochemical parameters (PP) such as p(H), dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, electric conductivity, salinity, biological oxygen demand, magnesium cation, and turbidity are analyzed from 27 representative sampling stations as sandchar, mining, and pit sites along the upper, middle, and lower course. Pearson correlation indicates that p(H) and magnesium cation is the most significant parameters with WQI. Principal component analysis denotes good water quality (<50) concentrated in sandchar sites, while poor (50-70) and very poor (>70) water qualities are presence in mining and pit sites. Applying Simpson's index, Simpson's index of diversity, Simpson's reciprocal index, and Shannon-Wiener diversity index on instream biota, those vary from sandchar (0.19, 0.81, 5.57, and -1.34) to mining (0.11, 0.89, 9.23, and -1.39) and pit sites (0.12, 0.90, 10.68, and -1.50). Maximum Margalef's index of species indicated the richness of species types in mining sites (4.62), with minimum mean values in sandchar sites (3.64). Contrastingly, Pielou's evenness index is high in sandchar sites (-1.05) and low in mining sites (-1.49). Therefore, significant physicochemical parameters such as P-H, dissolved oxygen, magnesium cation, and electric conductivity changes the diversity index, species richness and evenness in mining and pit along the middle and lower courses caused by sand mining.

Our study aims to gain evidence-based knowledge on the impact of both P. parva and its parasite Sphaerothecum destruens on native fish populations by analysing fish assemblages and body condition of individuals of native fish species in floodplain water bodies that were invaded and uninvaded by P. parva. We explored the use of environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques to detect S. destruens. Prevalence of S. destruens in native fish species was assessed. Fish samplings showed significantly negative correlations between the abundance of P. parva and the native Leucaspius delineatus, and Pungitius pungitius and three biodiversity indices of the fish assemblages (Simpson's diversity index, Shannon-Wiener index and evenness). Contrastingly, the abundances of the native Gasterosteus aculeatus and P. parva were positively related. In nearly all isolated water bodies with P. parva, this species is outnumbering native fish species. No effect of P. parva presence was found on body condition of native fish species. Sphaerothecum destruens was demonstrated to occur in both P. parva and G. aculeatus. Gasterosteus aculeatus is suggested to be an asymptomatic carrier that can aid the further spread of S. destruens. Analysis of eDNA proved to be a promising method for early detection of S. destruens, here showing that S. destruens presence coincided with P. parva presence. The ongoing invasion of both P. parva and S. destruens is predicted to pose a significant risk to native fish communities.

This study evaluates the responses of the taxa Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) to suspended sediment and grain size distribution in eight selected study sites in the Tsitsa River catchment. The sampling of macroinvertebrates took place seasonally from August 2016 to April 2017 and EPT identified to either genus or species level. To avoid site redundancy, the sites were clustered into four groups, with groups 1 and 2 being more impacted when compared to groups 3 and 4. The results of the sediment grain size analysis revealed that sediment grain size distribution ranged from 0.121 to 5.61 mu m; percent clay and percent silt were the most dominant sediment fractions across all groups. Among the EPT metrics examined, Shannon index, Simpson's index, evenness, Ephemeroptera abundance, EPT abundance and Trichoptera abundance were sensitive, differentiating between sediment groups 3 and 4 (less impacted groups) from 1 and 2 (highly impacted groups). Site groups 3 and 4 supported more EPT species, in terms of the number of individuals and diversity. Species such as Caenis sp., Pseudocloeon glaucum, Oligoneuropsis lawrencei and Baetis sp. were considered sediment-tolerant, displaying strong positive association with influenced groups. Taxa such as Hydropsyche sp., Pseudocloeon sp., Cheumatopsyche sp. and Afronurus sp. were considered sediment-sensitive. Overall, the present study revealed that genera/species within the order EPT were differentially sensitive to fine sediment stress and grain sizes, proving to be useful bioindicators.

The Lorenz curve: a suitable framework to define satisfactory indices of landscape composition								LANDSCAPE ECOLOGY				34	12			2735	2742		10.1007/s10980-019-00926-4			DEC 2019	2019	Context Patch diversity, evenness and dominance are important metrics of landscape composition. They have been traditionally measured using indices based on Shannon's information entropy (H) and Simpson's concentration statistic (lambda). Objectives The main objectives of this study are: (1) to show that the Lorenz curve is an appropriate framework to understand and measure patch dominance, evenness and diversity; (2) to show that Lorenz-compatible indices have better mathematical behavior than H-based and lambda-based indices. Methods Thirteen different hypothetical landscapes were created to assess landscape composition with the Lorenz curve and to compare the mathematical behavior of Lorenz-compatible indices with that of H-based and lambda-based indices. Results The Lorenz curve is a suitable framework to understand and measure patch dominance, evenness and diversity due to four relevant equivalences: (1) patch dominance = the separation of the Lorenz curve from the 45-degree line of perfect patch evenness; (2) patch evenness = 1 - patch dominance; (3) patch diversity (eliminated by patch dominance) = patch richness x patch dominance; (4) patch diversity (preserved by patch evenness) = patch richness x patch evenness. Accordingly, patch diversity/patch richness = 1 - patch dominance and land-cover concentration = 1/patch diversity. Conclusions Lorenz-compatible indices have better mathematical behavior than H-based and lambda-based indices, exhibiting greater coherence and objectivity when measuring patch dominance, evenness and diversity.

Dambos wetlands occur within the wooded grassland and grassland vegetation of NNR and provide a wide range of Ecosystem Services (ES), including life support for animal species, regulation of water flow and prevention of soil erosion. It also generates income for the livelihoods of local communities by providing land for agriculture and harvesting of non-timber products. The dynamics of these ecosystems is poorly understood despite the contribution of the dambos to global biodiversity and ES. This research is the first preliminary assessment of the vegetation structure and composition of six dambos within NNR, selected using Google Earth, MODIS satellite images and an exploratory field visit. Field data collection was performed using a two-stage systematic sampling approach, along transect lines of 100 x 10m (0.1 ha), perpendicular to the dambos' flow. Square plots of 0.25 m(2) were established for grass survey within the transects where grass vegetation was measured, counted and identified. Data were analyzed with R software. The sociological position of each species was analyzed with regard to the vertical structure while for horizontal structure, the abundance, dominance, frequency and Importance Value Index (IVI) were determined. In order to understand the differences between dambos, evenness (H) and reciprocal of Simpson's heterogeneity index (Hill's N-2) were calculated. Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) and Cluster Analysis were also used to characterize the surveyed species communities. A total of 58 transects (5.8 ha) and 336 subplots were assessed, recording 110 woody and 73 grass species, respectively. The most common tree species were Vitex doniana, Burkea africana, Syzygium cordatum and Annona senegalensis, while for grass vegetation the most abundant species were Andropogon eucomus and Helictotrichon turgidulum. According to the IVI, the most dominant tree and shrub species were V. doniana, Pseudolachnostylis maprouneifolia, A. senegalensis and S. cordatum. Homogeneity (Hill's N-2 = 18.92) and evenness (H = -4.27) were, on average, low in all dambos. Dambo 2 was the most heterogeneous (Hill's N-2 = 18.21) while dambo 1 was the least heterogeneous (Hill's N-2 = 5.71). Dambo 6 was most equitable (H = -1.35) whereas dambo 2 the least equitable (H = -3.72). Using species abundance and based on PCoA and cluster analysis, four main groups of dambos were identified based mainly on the water gradient, with data variation captured by the first three axes reaching almost 83%. The p-value (0.42), suggested no significant differences between species communities in the dambos, and thus, human disturbances appear not to be enough to modify dambos microenvironment. Accordingly, the results suggest that human activities, at this level, do not necessarily affect the structure and diversity of dambos in the NNR. The results also suggest that the species A. senegalensis, Combretum psidioides, Crossopteryx febrifuga, Protea nitida, P. maprouneifolia and S. cordatum can be used as indicator dambo species in NNR, with high likelihood of occurrence.

J	Thukral, Ashwani Kumar; Bhardwaj, Renu; Kumar, Vinod; Sharma, Anket								New indices regarding the dominance and diversity of communities, derived from sample variance and standard deviation								HELIYON				5	10					e02606	10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e02606			OCT 2019	2019	Dominance and diversity are important characteristics for the description of communities. The most commonly used indices are Simpson's dominance indexand Shannon's and Simpson's indices of diversity. This paper uses the basic concepts of statistics as applied to community analysis to develop new dominance and diversity indices that will enable scientists to establish correlations among various indices. The present study proves that the variance of the number of individuals of different species in a sample can be used to calculateSimpson's dominance and diversity indices. New indices have been developed from the ratios ofthe variance to number of species, and the mean number of individuals per species in a quadrat. A wide range of data, varying from high dominance to high evenness, was simulated for 25 quadrats, with each quadrat having ten species and 100 individuals in different combinations. Variance and standard deviation-based indices were computed using the simulated data and were found to be highly correlated with Simpson's and Shannon's indices. The proposed indices will give both the dominance and diversity of a community on the same scale based on the same statistic. Another important contribution of the present study relates to the variance of a sample consisting of a single value. It has been proved that the variance of a sample having only one value is equal to the square of that value. The paper establishes a new link between diversity studies and statistics.

In order to analyze the possible functionality of the aquatic environment, the composition and dominance of species was documented in detail. Sufficiency of sampling effort (rarefaction) was determined. The diversity of Shannon (H') and the equity of Pielou (J') based the characterization of the community and Simpson's dominance value (D) was calculated to detect impoverishing processes of diversity. The diversity was low, with a marked dominance of species in which small central diatoms stood out. Its presence is analyzed as benthic populations, in an environmental situation of frequent disturbance. The continuous presence of the dominant ones, far from representing a stable state, reveals a highly competitive ecosystem and suggests a tendency towards the decrease of biodiversity. Three taxa constituted new records for Mexico; one of them is new record for the Americas. The importance of floristic studies is highlighted in this ecosystem which, although fragile, is important because it acts as a thermal regulator in the Chalco Valley.

JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS				19	6			2764	2776		10.1007/s11368-019-02243-4			JUN 2019	2019	PurposeThe farming practices of ridge-furrow with film mulching (RFFM) have been extensively reported as a valuable technique for improving crop productivity and enhancing water-use efficiency. However, research on the high-yield mechanism of RFFM measures under drought stress from the perspective of microbial diversity has been scared.Materials and methodsField experiments were conducted to analyze the effects of conventional flat planting (FP), no film mulching (NR), white polyethylene film mulching (WR), black polyethylene film mulching (BR), and biodegradable film mulching (BDR) with 40 and 80cm furrow width levels on soil temperature, soil water storage (SWS), microbial carbon utilization, and yield of winter oilseed rape.Results and discussionThe RFFM significantly increased the SWS as well as rapeseed yield and yield components. However, these treatments did not cause obvious differences in soil temperature. A relative high value of average color change rate (AWCD) was observed during the incubation time of 24-216h, and it reached the peak value at 240h. The AWCD in the furrow with 80cm width was greater than that of 40cm. The RFFM also could improve the utilization intensities of soil microorganism on the carbon sources of carbohydrates, amino acids, and miscellaneous in rapeseed rhizosphere. This result was consistent with that of the principal component analysis. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Simpson's diversity index, and Shannon-Wiener evenness in BDR40, BR40, and BR80 were significantly higher than other treatments, respectively. In addition, correlation analysis results suggested that the indicator of affecting the diversity of carbon source was mainly due to the water storage capacity.ConclusionsThe methods of film mulching have a remarkable effect on microbial diversity. The yield of BR and BDR were significantly higher than other treatments. Compared with FP, RFFM increased rapeseed yield by 9.61-86.10%. In the year of less rainfall, production has decreased in comparison with the first season, while BDR80 guarantees continuous high yield and substantially promoted carbon utilization and soil microbial diversity. Soil microbial diversity is positively correlated with soil water content, which is beneficial to increase production. Wider furrow (80cm) is recommended a sustainable high-yield method due to convenient labor in the region in Southwest China.

The present research aims to identify and analyze the paleoecological characteristics of the marine ecosystems of central Sonora, Mexico; specifically, in the San Jose de Gracia area where the Proveedora, Buelna, Cerro Prieto and El Gavilan formations are exposed. In this study some ecological indices have been applied, such as Simpson's dominance and evenness, Shannon H' diversity, Menhinick species richness and Chao total species richness. Guilds and adaptive strategies show how different environments were occupied through time. The present work constitutes the first paleoecological work for the marine ecosystems of Cambrian strata in Mexico. The Proveedora Formation consists of fine-grained quartzarenite with high bioturbation and trace fossils, it shows a low species richness (4) and evenness, where suspension feeders are dominating. The paleoenvironmental analysis of this unit indicates a sandy environment, such as a coastal and sublittoral areas, sandbars or delta front. The Buelna Formation is composed of limestone interbedded with shale, containing algae, brachiopods, salterellids, hyolithids, trilobites and echinoderms. Mostly it possesses a medium species richness (9) and intermediate evenness. Functional groups are dominated by primary producers and suspension feeders. The paleoenvironmental analysis of this unit indicates a shallow marine environment. The Cerro Prieto Formation consists of an oolitic limestone strongly recrystallized with few fossils, mainly brachiopods and trilobites. It has a low species richness (2) distributed in an unevenness way since only one species occupies the whole site. It indicates a shallow marine environment of high energy. The El Gavilan Formation consists of a thick sequence of shale interbedded with limestone, having abundant fossils like poriferans, brachiopods, hyolithids and trilobites, with a species richness (16) and with a high evenness, exhibiting a great variety of functional groups, dominating the suspension feeders and nektobenthic forms. The paleoenvironmental analysis of this unit shows an open shelf environment.

Particularly vulnerable habitats are freshwater ecosystems, which are hotspots of biodiversity. The threat to these ecosystems are cyanobacterial blooms, which tend to proliferate in the face of climate changes. Cyanobacteria development and dominance affect the whole food web, especially the zooplankton community. We used three classical biodiversity indexes (species richness, Simpson's Diversity Index and Shannon Diversity Index) and three functional diversity indexes (functional richness, functional evenness and functional divergence) to study the impact of cyanobacterial bloom on the zooplankton community. The study was conducted in water bodies with a different period of bloom duration (short-lasting blooms vs. long-lasting blooms) in order to determine the impact of the proliferated blooms on the aquatic ecosystems. Use of functional diversity indexes allowed for identifying changes that can be overlooked by classical biodiversity indexes. We conclude that cyanobacterial bloom involves modifications of functional trait space of studied communities and, in consequence, functioning of aquatic ecosystems.

To understand the population dynamics and assess population structure of P. ultimum in Michigan floriculture crops, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were developed using the previously published P. ultimum predicted transcriptome. A total of 166 isolates sampled from 2011 to 2013 from five, one, and three greenhouses in Kalamazoo, Kent, and Wayne Counties, respectively, were analyzed using six polymorphic and fluorescently labeled SSR markers. The average unbiased Simpson's index (X., 0.95), evenness (E5, 0.56), and recovery of 12 major clones out of the 65 multilocus genotypes obtained, suggests that P. ultimum is not a recent introduction into Michigan greenhouses. Analyses revealed a clonal population, with limited differentiation among seasons, hosts, and counties sampled. Results also indicated the presence of common genotypes among years, suggesting that sanitation measures should be enhanced to eradicate resident P. ultimum populations. Finally, the presence of common genotypes among counties suggests that there is an exchange of infected plant material among greenhouse facilities, or that there is a common source of inoculum coming to the region. Continued monitoring of pathogen populations will enhance our understanding of population dynamics of P. ultimum in Michigan and facilitate improvement of control strategies.

However, the identity of weed communities associated with the cultivation of different crops in farmlands remains largely unclear. Afield survey of weed seed banks was conducted in 2 280 fields at 228 sites of 62 locations representing three different types of farmland (95 paddy, 73 summer-ripe, and 60 autumn-ripe farmlands) along the bank of the Yangtze River in Anhui Province, China. A total of 43 families and 174 species of weeds were found in these weed seed banks. A comparison of the composition of weed groups in the seed banks showed that the species number and density percentage of grass, sedge and broadleaf weed groups were similar among the different types of farmland. The seed banks of all three farmland types shared 71 common weed species, accounting for 40.80% of the total number of species. These common weeds, which were both associated and not associated with crops, accounted for 91.71% of the total dominance degree among all farmland types. The crop-associated weed species were distributed in all soil layers of each farmland type. The Shannon-Wiener index H' (description of species diversity which is more sensitive to dense species) and Pielou's evenness index J (description of species evenness) in summer-ripe farmland were similar to those in autumn-ripe farmland but differed from those in paddy farmland. However, the Simpson's index D (description of species diversity which is more sensitive to sparse species) was similar among all three farmland types. The results of similarity comparison indicated that although the aboveground weed community differed among the different cropping patterns, the weed species composition in the soil seed bank was still similar. Consequently, our results demonstrate that after the implementation of long-term monoculture patterns, weed species compositions in the soil seed bank in different farmlands become homogenized regardless of the crop type.

Six forest sites were selected to examine the anthropogenic impacts on natural forests in which 3 sites were disturbed and 3 were control sites with natural vegetation without any disturbance. Total 102 species were recorded belonging to 42 families and the most dominant family was Lamiaceae followed by Poaceae. Dominant tree species of the area were Abies pindrow having IVI 90.94 and Pinus wallichiana has 69.51 IVI respectively. The shrub layer was dominated by Viburnum grandiflorum having IVI (29.2) followed by Berberis lycium (16.91) while herb layer was dominated by Fragaria nubicola (14.93), Bupleurum falcatum (12.69) and Impatiens bicolor (12.20). Average Simpson's diversity was 0.962; average Shannon diversity was 3.63; average species richness was 1.48; average species evenness was 0.91 whereas average maturity index was 42.18. Average tree density was 410/ha; average stump density was 360/ha; average stem to stump value was 2.08 whereas average regeneration rate was found to be 263.33/ha. The quantified structural forest attributes reveal a severe intensity of human pressure on the local forests. There is a serious threat to the ecosystem services provided by the local forest reserves and reflect the need of immediate merasures for the conservation and sustainable use of the forest resources.

The present paper endeavours to map, monitor wetlands and assess the changing hydro-ecological states of these in the moribund deltaic plain. Multi-temporal Landsat images since 1987-2016 are used for mapping and monitoring the wetlands. Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Water Presence Frequency (WPF) approaches are applied for time series water body extraction and integration of water body maps for making frequency continuum of wetlands. The fragmentation analysis is done to show the transformation pattern of wetland landscape. Total wetland areas are 46.66 and 88.55 km(2) in pre- and postmonsoon seasons respectively. Out of the total wetlands area of pre and postmonsoon seasons 18.21 km(2) (54.09%), 35.83 km(2) (62.14%) areas respectively have witnessed transformation from phase I (1987-1996) to phase III (2006-2016). The Fragmentation statistics shows that 35% of medium and large core wetlands have been changed into smaller one and numerous small wetlands have been lost. Different landscape ecological indices like Shannon's diversity index (SHDI) and Simpson's diversity index (SIDI) depict disaggregated pattern of wetlands. Maintenance of ecologically relevant channel flow and inundation is highly essential for minimizing transformation.

Methods: Larvae and adult mosquitoes were collected using the standard methods from different habitats in nine localities of three counties in the East Azerbaijan Province, Northwestern Iran during June to October 2017. In addition, species richness (R), Simpson's diversity index (D), Shannon-Wiener index (H) and evenness (E) as measures of diversity, were calculated. Results: Overall, 1401 mosquito specimens including 1015 adults and 386 larvae were collected in the study area. The properties of geographical larval habitats were recorded. Four genera along with 10 species were collected and identified, including Anopheles hyrcanus, An. maculipennis s.l., An. superpictus s.l., Aedes caspius, Ae. vexans, Culex pipiens, Cx. theileri, Cx. perexiguus, Culiseta longiareolata and Cs. subochrea. Among the three counties, Ahar region presented the highest species richness (R: 1.5) and diversity values (D: 0.79, H': 1.74, E: 0.73). Conclusion: This study provides important information on the diversity, distribution and ecology of ten mosquito species in the region. This information leads to a better understanding of mosquito population dynamics in relation to vector control measures.

In our present study we assessed the AMF diversity in coal mine abandoned overburden spoils of different age groups viz. 2 years, 10 years and 15 years abandoned site and an un-mined site, through trap culture using Oryza sativa L. and Zea mays L. as host plants. Spore density increases with the increase in age of overburden spoils. Five genera of AMF were isolated v.i.z. Acaulospora, Claroideoglomus, Funneliformis, Glomus and Rhizophagus, where, Acaulospora and Glomus were dominant. In both the trap plants un-mined site derived inoculum showed highest Shannon-Wiener Diversity index and Pielou's Evenness Index value whereas 2 years abandoned site derived inoculum showed lowest diversity index. In case of Simpson's dominance index, 10 years abandoned site derived inoculum has the highest value in Z. mays and 2 years abandoned site derived inoculum has the highest value in O. sativa trap culture respectively. Comparing the two trap plants, O. sativa showed higher colonization percentage, spore density and diversity index indicating that it has a capability to develop maximum interaction with study site derived inoculum. The dominant AMF species can further be utilized in studies for reclamation of abandoned coal mine overburden spoils.

To be sustainable, this production should protect environmental quality and biodiversity. Fertilized mixed-species prairie can deliver substantial quantities of cellulosic ethanol per unit land area with minimal losses of NO3-N in drainage water, but the long-term maintenance of biodiversity in such systems has been uncertain. We report how nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizer application, precipitation, and time affected the species composition and productivity of reconstructed prairie communities harvested annually as biofuel feedstocks over a 9-year period. Results indicated that both precipitation and fertilizer application drove above-ground biomass production, with the greatest response to fertilizer occurring in wetter than average years. Fertilization reduced species richness, but increased species evenness. Consequently, Simpson's diversity index did not differ between the fertilized and unfertilized communities, though it declined in both communities over time. A total of 59 plant species was recorded, with eight of them explaining most of the differences in vegetation cover between the fertilized and unfertilized treatments. After 9 years, the high fertility community was dominated by the C4 grass Andropogon gerardii, the C3 grass Elymus canadensis, and the non-leguminous forbs Heliopsis helianthoides, Helianthus maximiliani, and Monarda fistulosa, whereas the low fertility community was dominated by the C4 grasses A. gerardii and Sorghastrum nutans, the C3 grass E. canadensis, and the non-leguminous forb M. fistulosa. Fertilization increased the abundance of flowering forbs available to pollinators in the early, middle and late portions of the growing season. Synthesis and applications. Results of our study suggest that maintenance of reasonably high levels of productivity and biodiversity are possible in fertilized prairie communities harvested annually for bioenergy, with plant cover more evenly distributed among different functional groups. In the future, if policy and markets favour biofuels and better delivery of ecosystem services from harvested land, prairie-based feedstocks could become part of a renewable energy portfolio that fosters biodiversity and contributes to the provision of floral resources for pollinators.

Understanding how vegetation and soil recover after returning marginal cultivated land to its native state is important since soil plays a key role not only in food production but also in regulating global climate change. Soil samples were taken from two sites, a mixedgrass and a dry mixedgrass prairie, which have different climates and plant species composition. Each study site included one undisturbed native plot (CK) and two cultivated treatments that were abandoned in 2008 after being cultivated for more than ten years prior to this study, one with continuous wheat (Triticwn aestivurn L.) and the other with wheat-fallow rotations. Soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), and labile organic fraction content were measured in 2016, while plant coverage and species diversity were investigated in 2017. In both study sites, grass and sedge coverage in the previously cultivated treatments were lower than, with shrub and forb coverage similar to, the CK. The highest invasive species coverage appeared in the previously cultivated treatments. Species richness was higher with CK in the mixedgrass prairie but no differences were found in the more arid dry mixedgrass prairie. No differences were found among all treatments for species evenness, Simpson's index and Shannon Wiener index. On average, in the 0-15 cm depth, SOC and TN contents with the previous cultivated treatments were still 20% and 16% lower than CK, respectively, whereas in the 15-30 cm depth, SOC and TN contents did not differ among all treatments except for SOC content in the mixedgrass prairie. Relative to CK, previously cultivated treatments had similar active carbon (AC), microbial respiration-carbon and NH4+ -N contents but the mixedgrass prairie had lower water extractable-organic carbon and water extractable-nitrogen. In contrast, in the dry mixedgrass prairie all labile organic fraction contents, except for AC, were the same among all treatments. Negative relationships were found between plant diversity and surface soil carbon and nitrogen storage. Our results indicate that for short-term disturbed rangeland, 9 years is likely sufficient for the recovery of soil labile organic fractions and plant diversity but a longer time will be needed for the recovery of SOC and TN.

This study examined the recovery of soil physical properties and vegetation following Acacia mearnsii removal at Zvakanaka farm in Limpopo Province, South Africa. Soil and vegetation measurements were conducted in paired cleared, invaded and natural sites on 10 x 10 m plots. Results of the study show significantly (P < 0.001) higher soil moisture content in invaded and natural compared to cleared sites. Soil penetration was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in cleared than invaded and natural sites. Both infiltration rate and hydraulic conductivity showed no significant (P > 0.05) difference between the three sites. Strongly repellent soils were recorded in cleared sites only. Results showed a significant (P < 0.05) increase in measured diversity indices (species richness, Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's and evenness index) in cleared and natural than in invaded sites. However, most secondary woody invasive alien plants were recorded in cleared sites. The study concludes that A. mearnsii clearing triggers varying changes in soil physical properties. Although native plants are present in cleared sites, recovery may be hampered by the growth of secondary woody invasive alien plants.

Although exotic cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, is an increasing threat to mangrove ecosystems (including the associated unvegetated shoals) of China, its effects on the avifauna in such ecosystems are poorly understood. In Zhanjiang, China, the avifaunal Shannon-Weiner diversity, Simpson's diversity, Margalef's species richness, Pielou's evenness and density indices were compared in (1) an Avicennia marina monoculture vs. an S. alterniflora-invaded A. marina stand (a mixture of A. marina and S. alterniflora) and (2) an unvegetated shoal vs. an S. alterniflora-invaded shoal that had rapidly become an S. alterniflora monoculture. All avifaunal community parameters except for the Simpson index were significantly lower in the S. alterniflora thorn A. marina mixture than in the A. marina monoculture, and in the S. alterniflora monoculture than in the unvegetated shoal. These results indicate that the presence of S. alterniflora reduces the suitability of the Zhanjiang mangrove ecosystem for avifauna. Among the four habitats, the Shannon-Weiner diversity index, species richness, and density of the avifaunal community were highest in the unvegetated shoal. Further analysis indicated that the differences in the avifaunal community between invaded and noninvaded sites were associated with vegetation characteristics (mainly plant height and density) and macrobenthic faunal metrics (mainly species richness and density). The reduced avifaunal diversity and abundance associated with S. alterniflora invasion probably resulted from the decline in food resources or from the increased difficulty in foraging and roosting. The findings indicate that the conservation of birds in mangrove ecosystems may depend on controlling or eradicating exotic S. alterniflora, maintaining tidal mudflats, and diversifying the habitats in mangrove wetlands.

Nevertheless, the connection between host-microbial community diversity, their function under biotic stress in addition to their impact on plant performances is poorly understood. The study was designed with the aim to analyze the tripartite interactions among Chitiniphilus sp., Streptomyces sp. and their combination with indigenous rhizospheric microbial population of Bacopa monnieri for enhancing the plant growth and bacoside A content under Meloidogyne incognita stress. Overall, plants treated with the microbial combination recorded enhanced growth as illustrated by significantly higher biomass (2.0 fold), nitrogen uptake (1.8 fold) and bacoside A content (1.3 fold) along with biocontrol efficacy (58.5%) under nematode infected field. The denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) fingerprints of 16S-rDNA revealed that microbial inoculations are major initiators of bacterial community structure in the plant rhizosphere. Additionally, the plants treated with microbial combination showed maximum diversity viz., Shannon's (3.29), Margalef's (4.21), and Simpson's (0.96) indices. Likewise the metabolic profiling data also showed a significant variation among the diversity and evenness indices upon microbial application on the native microflora. We surmise that the application of beneficial microbes in combinational mode not only helped in improving the microbial community structure but also successfully enhanced plant and soil health under biotic stress.

We used a five-year dataset of dung beetles from undisturbed forest, primary forest corridors, and Eucalyptus plantations to compare the sensitivity of conceptually equivalent metrics to temporal variation in different anthropogenic disturbances. We compared species richness with functional richness, Pielou's evenness with functional evenness, and Simpson's diversity with Rao's quadratic entropy. We assessed the sensitivity of the metrics to anthropogenic changes. The indices showed complex patterns among habitat types, with with similar responses in some cases and not in other, and little incongruence between the pairs within the same year. The influence of disturbance on longer-term temporal variation over the five-year period revealed lower temporal variation in functional than taxonomic metrics. Both approaches showed greater variation in plantations compared to native forests. We evaluated the variation in taxonomic and functional metrics between consecutive years and among habitats. Most metrics showed similar shifts between years in all habitats, except for species and functional richness. We demonstrate that even conceptually similar indices may not provide similar information on dung beetles responses to disturbance. However, the differences between the indices can yield key insights about the drivers of change, especially over the long-term. It is important to use taxonomic and functional diversity in tandem to better understand community responses to environmental and anthropogenic changes.

NEMATODE COMMUNITIES AS BIOLOGICAL INDICATORS OF DISTURBANCE IN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS								NEMATROPICA				48	2			186	197					DEC 2018	2018	The native forest area in the Brazilian Cerrado has been replaced by agro-ecosystems and is considered the last agricultural frontier of the country. Thus, the use of sustainable agro-ecosystems can minimize damage to the environment. To assess the sustainability of these systems, there are several types of indicators, including physical, chemical, and biological. Among the biological indicators are nematodes. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate nematodes as bio-indicators of disturbance during the establishment of a crop-livestock-forest integrated system (iCLF). Ten farming systems were evaluated (Forest, Crop, Livestock, Crop-Livestock, Livestock-Crop, Crop-Forest, Livestock-Forest, three different Crop-Livestock-Forest, Native Forest, and Spontaneous Vegetation). A native forested area and a spontaneous vegetation area were used as controls (stable environments). Samples were taken at the establishment of the systems and another during the crop season of the second year. The nematode communities were evaluated using total and relative abundance, Shannon-Weaver and Simpson's diversity indexes and evenness, a wealth index (D), a maturity index (MI), a modified maturity index (MMI), a 2-5 maturity index (MI2-5), and a plant parasite index (PPI). The data were subjected to ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5% (P <0.05) significance in order to identify the effects of treatments on the nematode community. Plant-parasitic nematodes dominated at both harvests. Fungivores and bacterivores were reduced after the implantation. A greater number of representative genera of predatory nematodes were observed in the sampling carried out in the second year of implantation of the systems. Omnivores were slightly reduced under the influence of the Crop-Livestock (CL), the three iCLF systems, and the native forest area. The largest Shannon-Weaver's diversity index and evenness were found in the Livestock-Forest (LF), the three iCLF systems, and the spontaneous vegetation area. The iCLF systems were the only systems in the second sampling that increased all diversity indexes, evenness and richness, unlike the Crop (C) system and the CL system. A lower MI value was found in the C system. The greatest MI values were observed in the CL, the three iCLF systems, and the spontaneous vegetation area. The maturity indices (MI and MI2-5), modified maturity index (MMI), and plant parasite index (PPI) indexes indicated that the spontaneous vegetation and native forest areas were reference areas with stable environments. In short, diversity measures and other indexes showed that the LF and iCLF systems generated less disturbance to the environment whereas the C system caused major disturbances.		[Coutinho, R.

Finfish Diversity and Distribution in a Boreal, Macrotidal Bay								NORTHEASTERN NATURALIST				25	4			545	570		10.1656/045.025.0403			DEC 2018	2018	Cobscook Bay is an 11- km(2) geographically complex, boreal, and macrotidal bay in eastern Maine. The physical environment, primary producers, and invertebrate assemblage of the bay are well-characterized, but no contemporary data exist on its finfish assemblage. We sampled the finfish assemblage of Cobscook Bay from 2011 to 2013 in May, June, August, and September to create a baseline dataset suitable for future comparisons. We also examined the composition, diversity, and annual changes in the assemblage. We sampled in the subtidal and intertidal zones using seines (n = 390), fyke nets (n = 72), and benthic (n = 112) and pelagic (n = 111) trawls; sampling was divided among the bay's 3 different sub-bays. We collected more than 60,000 individuals from 46 species. We employed species richness, Simpson's index of diversity, and non-metric multidimensional scaling (with the Bray-Curtis and Horn-Morisita indices) to examine spatial and temporal variation of finfish assemblages throughout the bay. Our analysis suggested that data collected in the subtidal pelagic were not a representative sample of that assemblage. Therefore, we considered 2 assemblages: the intertidal and subtidal benthic. Assemblage composition and species' relative abundances were different at dicl, monthly, and annual timescales and were associated with changes in the catch rate of ubiquitous species. In the intertidal, these species included Gasterosteus aculeatus (Threespine Stickleback), Clupea harengus (Atlantic Herring), Alosa pseudoharengus (Alewife), and Menidia menidia (Atlantic Silverside). In the subtidal, the common species were Atlantic Herring and Pseudopleuronectes americanus (Winter Flounder). Statistical analyses indicated that both spatial and temporal factors were significant predictors of assemblage evenness. The sampling design, albeit complex, was sufficient to capture these differences and characterize these assemblages. Implications for future studies are that the study design must be sufficiently complex to capture the anticipated spatial and temporal variability inherent in such dynamic environments. Furthermore, given recent warming trends in the Gulf of Maine, this study's results suggest the importance of thoroughly understanding local temporal and ecosystem variability.

J	Feoli, E.								Classification of plant communities and fuzzy diversity of vegetation systems								COMMUNITY ECOLOGY				19	2			186	198		10.1556/168.2018.19.2.11			DEC 2018	2018	After stressing the need to keep separated the concept of variability and/or inequality and dissimilarity from that of diversity, it is suggested that diversity of a system should be measured primarily by the number of different classes (K) we can define in it (richness) by classification or identification processes. An index delta, ranging between 0 and 1, that summarizes the similarity pattern within the system, can be used if necessary to transform K to a "fuzzy" diversity number, according to the idea that the higher is the similarity within the system the lower should be its diversity. Another index, rho, is proposed to measure the "loss" of diversity due to similarity within the system, an index that fits the concept of "redundancy". Since every diversity vector may be interpreted as a crisp synunetric similarity matrix, of which the Gini-Simpson's index is the average dissimilarity, while the index of Shannon is the entropy of its eigenvalues, the index delta can be chosen to quantify one among the following similarities: a) the overall average similarity of the classes considering the within classes similarity equal to 1 and the between classes similarity equal to 0 (crisp similarity pattern): this is coincident with the evenness of the proportion of importance of the classes, b) the average similarity between the classes without considering evenness, or c) the combination of the two similarities (similarity between the classes and evenness). In these last two cases, the similarity between the classes is characterizing the similarity pattern of a system in a fuzzy way (fuzzy diversity). It is stressed that the diversity of vegetation systems may be of two complementary types: plant individual-based diversity and plant community-based diversity. If we assume that each plant community type corresponds to one habitat then habitat diversity (or niche width) can be calculated for each class of plant individuals according to the number of classes of plant communities in which we can find it. Habitat diversity can be used to measure the indicator value of species or other classes of plant individuals and of plant communities. In this last case, we have to consider the distribution of plant communities in classes defined by environmental factors. It is suggested that the terminology alpha, beta, gamma diversity can be useful only if used to distinguish types of diversity in vegetation systems: alpha diversity = plant individual based diversity, gamma diversity = the union of alpha diversities, beta diversity = plant community based diversity. Thanks to the availability of mathematical tools, it is concluded that rather than being worried about measuring diversity it would be more fruitful to worry about why we are willing to measure it.

UC is a relapsing non-transmural inflammatory disease that is restricted to the colon and is characterized by flare-ups of bloody diarrhea. CD is a chronic, segmental localized granulomatous disease that can affect any part of the entire gastrointestinal tract. Ileo-anal pouch is a procedure restoring functionality of the rectum after a colectomy. IBD is a multifactorial disease and flares of IBD are probably triggered by changes in the intestinal microbiota followed by an abnormal immune response. In this study, we aim to analyze the intestinal bacterial diversity in IBD patients during various stages of disease compared with healthy controls. Permission for human experiments and recruitment of participants was obtained from the Ethic Committee for Copenhagen County hospitals (Permission no. KA-03019, Permission no. KA-20060159). Stools from 26 healthy controls, 42 CD, 38 UC and 18 pouch patients were collected. Stool DNA extraction was performed using Qiagen, DNA mini stool kit Denmark. DGGE-PCR amplifying the V2-V3 region of 16S-rDNA gene of the bacteria was amplified by universal primers HDA1 and HDA2. Analysis of DGGE was performed blinded using BioNumerics version 7.5. After normalization, a DGGE gel band matching was performed. The similarities between profiles were calculated with a ranked Pearson correlation coefficient based on the band matching results using band intensities. Simpson's index of diversity and Pielou's species evenness were calculated. Based on the Shannon Diversity Index, UC patients had lower species diversity and bacterial evenness in comparison to healthy persons, p < 0.05. However, only CD and disease pouch patients had lower species diversity compared to those with inactive disease and healthy controls. Well-functioning pouch patients had decreased species evenness in comparison. to diseased pouch patients and control group. During the active disease stage in CD and pouch, the patients have a low bacterial diversity in their gut when compared to the inactive stage. In UC patients, a generally low diversity was observed at all stages of the disease compared to healthy controls.

These forests provide several ecosystems services to the mankind and have very high ethnomedicinal values. The present work was conducted in tropical dry deciduous forest of Jashpur, a tribe dominating district of Chhattisgarh. Plant diversity has been studied at six different sites out of which three were heavily disturbed whereas three were moderately disturbed. At these sites dominance and distribution patterns of tree species, tree density (stems ha(-1)), relative dominance, importance value index and diversity indices (species richness, species equitability, evenness, Simpson's index, Shannon-Weiner index, beta diversity, disturbance index) were calculated. These plants are being widely used by tribal as medicines, and hence, documentation of ethnomedicinal wisdom of tribal people was also done. Information Consensus Factor (ICF) and Fidelity Levels (FL) were also calculated to know the therapeutic uses by the local communities of the region. Present work has documented the ethnomedicianl knowledge that can be used by government agencies in preparation of Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) to protect Indian traditional medicinal knowledge and prevent its misappropriation at International Patent Offices. In addition, the results of the study may be helpful for developing policies for the conservation of these forests to sustain their ecosystem services to the mankind.

A unified concept of dominance applicable at both community and species scales								ECOSPHERE				9	11					e02477	10.1002/ecs2.2477			NOV 2018	2018	Dominance and evenness can be two sides of the same coin or opposite ends of a spectrum. Although evenness and diversity are community-level concepts, dominance can be applied at both community and species scales. Nevertheless, there is not a metric applicable at both these scales that are unified with a single mathematical framework in the existing literature. Here, by extending Lloyd's meaning crowding concept from the population to community scale, we propose a dominance concept and associated metrics that are applicable at both scales. Such metrics can act as proxies for diversity in diversity-stability and diversity-ecosystem service analyses or for population abundance in species interaction network analysis and population stability analysis, with advantages in cross-scale and unified analyses. Our concept of dominance includes three measures (metrics) that link communities and species. The metrics have the same mathematical form, but different interpretations at the community and species scales. Our community-level metric is a function of Simpson's () diversity index, for which we present a rigorous mathematical proof. Our species-level metrics quantify the difference between community dominance and the dominance of a virtual community whose mean population size, per species, equals the population size of the focal species. We demonstrate the use of these metrics using data from a longitudinal study of the human vaginal microbiome and provide new insights relevant for microbiome stability and disease etiology at the community scale. The new metrics also can be used for species dominance network (SDN) analysis at the species scale. Since the species dominance is a function of both species (population) abundance and community dominance, it has an advantage of capturing both community-scale global and species-scale local information, which becomes even more evident when it is used to construct SDNs. These results demonstrate the significance and applications of our unified dominance concept and metrics.

J	Gogoi, Anudip; Sahoo, Uttam Kumar								Impact of anthropogenic disturbance on species diversity and vegetation structure of a lowland tropical rainforest of eastern Himalaya, India								JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE				15	11			2453	2465		10.1007/s11629-017-4713-4			NOV 2018	2018	Impact of anthropogenic disturbance on species diversity and vegetation structure of a lowland tropical rainforest was studied in the foothills of Eastern Himalaya, India. Tree species richness, density, basal area and the diversity indices were found significantly (P<0.05) decreased with the increasing level of disturbances whereas, shrub density, basal area and herb density significantly increased with increasing disturbance level. In case of shrubs, Simpson's dominance index significantly (P<0.007) increased along the disturbance gradient, whereas Pielou's evenness index significantly (P<0.005) decreased with an increasing level of disturbance. Shannon-Weiner diversity index for herbs significantly (P<0.016) increased with increasing disturbance whereas, Simpson's dominance index was significantly (P<0.013) declined along the disturbance gradient. Results revealed that 10-50 cm dbh classes constituted the highest stem density, and highest basal area was recorded in the >100 cm dbh class in all three sites. Density of the matured trees decreased with increasing DBH whereas, tree basal area tended to increase with increasing DBH in all three sites. Tree species richness was highest in the lower DBH classes. 62.07% of the total tree species regenerated in the largely undisturbed site followed by 50% in the mildly disturbed and 26.32% in the highly disturbed site. The overall regeneration condition was found to be good in the largely undisturbed site. Mildly disturbed site exhibited fair regeneration and so was in the highly disturbed site. Discernable variations in species composition, diversity, regeneration and tree population structure revealed the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on rainforest vegetation dynamics. Higher degree of disturbance was furtherly found not only affecting species diversity but also promoting the growth of invasive weed species. Dominance of Hydnocarpus kurzii and Crypteronia paniculata in the highly disturbed site also indicated that these less-valued timber species may benefit from the vegetation mosaic produced by the disturbance; so differences in abundance of these species may be useful for bio-indication. Furthermore, present study suggests the need of adequate biodiversity conservation measures and adaptation of sustainable forest management approaches in disturbed areas of lowland tropical rainforest in the foothills of eastern Himalaya, India.

We used the Shannon-Weiner and Simpson's indices of diversity, Margalef's index of species richness and Pielou's evenness index to quantify the structure of vascular plant assemblages. We measured soil parameters (NO3-, NH4+, available P, Mg++, K+, Na+, Ca++, organic matter, pH, soil moisture), elevation, slope gradient and aspect and their correlations with plant community parameters. In total, we recorded and identified 207 species and subspecies in the study area. Species cover, richness and diversity indices varied significantly by vegetation type (P < 0.01). Available NO3- and Ca++ in the soil were important factors for the area and species representation in the species-environment correlations estimated for the Kavakli area. Available NO3-, pH, organic matter, Ca++ and K+ in the soil were important factors for the area and species representation in the species-environment correlations analysed for the Citdere area.

Embracing scale-dependence to achieve a deeper understanding of biodiversity and its change across communities; Embracing scale-dependence to achieve a deeper understanding of biodiversity and its change across communities								ECOLOGY LETTERS; ECOLOGY LETTERS				21	11			1737	1751		10.1111/ele.13151			NOV 2018	2018	Because biodiversity is multidimensional and scale-dependent, it is challenging to estimate its change. However, it is unclear (1) how much scale-dependence matters for empirical studies, and (2) if it does matter, how exactly we should quantify biodiversity change. To address the first question, we analysed studies with comparisons among multiple assemblages, and found that rarefaction curves frequently crossed, implying reversals in the ranking of species richness across spatial scales. Moreover, the most frequently measured aspect of diversity - species richness - was poorly correlated with other measures of diversity. Second, we collated studies that included spatial scale in their estimates of biodiversity change in response to ecological drivers and found frequent and strong scale-dependence, including nearly 10% of studies which showed that biodiversity changes switched directions across scales. Having established the complexity of empirical biodiversity comparisons, we describe a synthesis of methods based on rarefaction curves that allow more explicit analyses of spatial and sampling effects on biodiversity comparisons. We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspective informs the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted during 2016 in North Khorasan Province. The sampling was focused on rural regions, where human cases of VL and/or CL were diagnosed and reported during last 5 years. Sand flies were collected three times each twenty days during peak periods of seasonal activity. Seven collection methods were used. Some Alpha and Beta diversity indices were calculated. Results: Overall, 7253 sand flies were collected and identified. They were from 19 species of Phlebotominae sandflies. Phlebotomus sergenti and Ph. papatasi were the most prevalent (84.9%) species in the study area. Species richness (S) was very different in three areas and were 18, 8, and 4 respectively but Evenness (E) were 0.357, 0.345, and 0.380, so evenness was almost equal in the study areas. Shannon Index (H') and Margalef Richness Index were calculated 1.033, 0.718, 0.527 and 2.117, 0.8998, 0.4006 respectively. Conclusion: The sand fly fauna in North Khorasan Province was very rich and often included some of the most important proven or suspected vectors of leishmaniasis. Species diversity indices (Shannon index, and Simpson's index) were not high due to decreasing in evenness. The Margalef richness index could accurately reflect the biodiversity of sand flies between three subtidal locations.

The samples were collected from three partially separated stations of the Chashma Lake on a monthly basis. A total 42 species of zooplankton were identified from the Chashma Lake belonging to three taxa viz.; copepoda, rotifera and cladocera. The diversity of the zooplankton species in the lake was determined by richness and evenness indices, which were found as follows; Margalef Index 1.30 to 3.87, Shannon's Index 2.54 to 3.68, Simpson Index 0.92 to 0.97, Simpson's Reciprocal Index 12.25 to 37.69 and Pielou's Evenness Index 0.94 to 1.0. The zooplankton community was found abundant in summer as compared to winter. The copepods were found dominant followed by rotifers and cladocerans for entire study period. The spatial distribution of zooplankton was not found prominent as compared to their seasonal distribution. However, rotifers showed spatial difference among sampling stations (ANOVA, p-value < 0.05). The present study provides a first detailed spatial and seasonal distribution of zooplankton in Chashma Lake, which may be a road map for further studies on zooplankton diversity in other freshwater lakes in the region.

Mining and characterization of microsatellites from a genome of <i>Venturia carpophila</i>								MYCOLOGICAL PROGRESS				17	8			885	895		10.1007/s11557-018-1401-x			AUG 2018	2018	A total of 4021 microsatellites were mined from a genome of Venturia carpophila, and 192 were selected to screen 39 isolates of the fungus collected from peach and nectarine in the southeastern USA. Of the 192 selected, 32 primers consistently and reliably produced polymorphic amplicons. Subsequently, the genotyping data from these 32 primers were used for preliminary analysis of the genetic diversity among the 39 isolates. The number of alleles identified ranged from 2 to 9, and the polymorphic information content from 0.097 to 0.792. Over all isolates, Shannon's information index was 0.914, indicating genetic diversity. Stoddart and Taylor's index of diversity and Simpson's index also indicated high diversity (32.4 and 0.969, respectively). Evenness within the sample was high (0.955), but there was strong evidence for haploid linkage disequilibrium (3.799, P = 0.001). Observations on diversity were supported by analysis of genetic distance, which showed little affinity for clustering based on isolate source population, location, or host. The microsatellites developed in this study should be useful in future research of the population genetic structure and dynamics of V. carpophila and evaluating the risks posed by the ability of the pathogen to adapt on peach and possibly other stone fruit hosts in the USA and elsewhere in the world.

In this study, soil samples were collected from three volcanoes in Wudalianchi, northeastern China: Laoheishan (LH, approximately 240 years old), Dongjiaodebushan (DJ, 0.45-0.6 million years old), and Nangelaqiushan (NG, 0.8-1.3 million years old). For each volcano, both southern (S) and northern (N) slope aspects were sampled. Soil microbial communities were analyzed using phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA). The results showed that soil properties and microbial biomass changed perceptibly among different volcanoes and different slope aspects. Almost all of the detected soil nutrient contents of LH were lowest, and total microbial biomass of LH was 40 and 36% lower than those of NG and DJ, respectively. LH was significantly different from NG and DJ in soil microbial community structure with a higher relative abundance of fungi and a lower relative abundance of actinomycetes and bacteria. However, for the two ancient volcanoes (NG and DJ), soil microbial community structures were highly similar among different ages and different slope aspects. No difference was detected in any of the measured microbial indices, including richness, evenness, Shannon's diversity, Simpson's diversity and the relative abundance of different microbial groups. The results indicated that while soil microbial biomass may change across different soil environments after long-term succession, soil microbial community structure can remain relatively stable. The results further indicated that soil microbes may show different successional patterns in different stages of succession.

Ornamental bromeliads of Miami-Dade County, Florida are important breeding sites for <i>Aedes aegypti</i> (Diptera: Culicidae)								PARASITES & VECTORS				11						283	10.1186/s13071-018-2866-9			MAY 17 2018	2018	Background: A major public health concern is the emergence and geographical spread of vector-borne diseases such as Zika and yellow fever. Ornamental bromeliads retaining water in their leaf axils represent potential breeding sites for mosquitoes. As the role of ornamental bromeliads in breeding Aedes aegypti in Miami-Dade County, Florida is unknown, we hypothesize that ornamental bromeliads are important breeding sites for Ae. aegypti. Our objective was to survey bromeliads in areas with high densities of adult Ae. aegypti, including those with 2016 local transmission of Zika virus. Methods: Ornamental bromeliads were surveyed for the presence of immature mosquitoes at 51 locations of Miami-Dade County, Florida. Bromeliads were sampled for the presence of immature stages of mosquitoes, their reservoirs were drained and screened for the presence of immature mosquitoes. Immature mosquitoes were stored in plastic containers and preserved in 70% ethanol until morphological identification. Biodiversity of species assemblages was assessed by Shannon's and Simpson's indices, and individual rarefaction curves and plots of cumulative abundance, Shannon's index and evenness profiles. Results: Ornamental bromeliads were present in all surveyed areas, yielding a total of 765 immature mosquitoes, comprising five taxonomic units: Ae. aegypti, Wyeomyia mitchellii, Wyeomyia vanduzeei, Culex quinquefasciatus and Culex biscaynensis. The biodiversity indices point to a low diversity scenario with a highly dominant species, Ae. aegypti. Discussion: Our findings suggest that ornamental bromeliads are contributing for the proliferation of Ae. aegypti in the County of Miami-Dade, which may indicate a shift in the paradigm of usage of bromeliads as breeding sites, highlighting that ornamental phytotelmata bromeliads are to be considered in future vector-control strategies to control Zika and other arboviruses.

Identification and delimitation of genets were inferred from excavation in small populations and from amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers by the standardized sampling design in large populations. Clonal architecture and clonal diversity were then estimated. For the four small populations, they were monoclonal, the spacer length (18.6 +/- 5.6 in tundra, 29.7 +/- 9.7 in Betula ermanii forest, P < 0.05) was shorter and branching intensity (136.7 +/- 32.9 in tundra, 43.4 +/- 12.3 in Betula ermanii forest, P < 0.05) was higher in the tundra than that in Betula ermanii forest. For the five large populations, they were composed of multiple genets with high level of clonal diversity (Simpson's index D = 0.84, clonal richness R = 0.25, Fager's evenness E = 0.85); the spatial distribution of genets showed that the clonal growth strategy of R. aureum exhibits both guerilla and phalanx. Our results indicate that the clonal plasticity of R. aureum could enhance exploitation of resource heterogeneity and in turn greatly contribute to maintenance or improvement of fitness and the high clonal diversity of R. aureum increase the evolutionary rates to adapt the harsh alpine environment in Changbai Mountain.

Electrodialytic treatment of sewage sludge: influence on microbiological community								INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY				15	5			1103	1112		10.1007/s13762-017-1459-z			MAY 2018	2018	This study aimed to evaluate the changes in microbiological communities present in sewage sludge (SS) when subjected to an electric field. The establishment of these relations is important to design and optimize an electrotechnology that not only promotes a direct degradation of the emerging organic contaminants, through electrodegradation, but also stimulates their biodegradation. Different current intensities were used continuously or by steps, in a two compartment electrodialytic (ED) cell. Samples collected between May and July of 2015 were analysed, prior to ED treatment, and the 35 Taxa identified were divided in 12 groups. Initial samples, collected on May, were mainly constituted by stalked ciliates (86%), followed by shelled amoebae (8%), whereas the samples collected between June and July presented higher number of shelled amoebae, between 52 and 92%. Epistylis, Vorticella and Arcella gibbosa were the most frequent protozoa identified. Samples richness (R) was between 7 and 14, Simpson's biodiversity index (D) between 0.45 and 0.69, and evenness between 0.42 and 0.65. At the end of the ED experiments, a decrease in the number of identified Taxa and individuals was observed and, consequently, SS biodiversity also decreased. This decline was more pronounced in the ED experiments conducted with currents above 50 mA (0.10 mA cm(-2)). In terms of abundance, the final SS was mainly constituted by shelled amoebae that showed to be the most resistant to the conditions within the ED cell. The obtained results showed that the studied conditions within the ED cell were not appropriate to the microbiological communities, which influenced the final SS quality.

Here, we investigated whether and how contrasting-sized canopy openings affect soil nematode community within a 30year-aged spruce plantation. The results indicated that the responses of soil nematodes to canopy opening size were dependant on their feeding habit. The abundance of total nematodes and that of free-living nematodes was negatively correlated with soil bulk density, whereas the abundance of omnivore-predators was negatively correlated with soil bulk density and shrubs cover, respectively. The ratio of the sum abundance of predators and omnivores to the plant parasites' abundance, Simpson's dominance index, Pielou's evenness index, and sigma maturity index, maturity index (MI), MI2-5, basal index, enrichment index, and structure index was sensitive to alteration in canopy opening size. Multivariate analysis indicated that thinning-induced gap size resulted in contrasting nematode assemblages. In conclusion, soil nematodes should be integrated as an indicator to monitor soil multifunctionality change due to thinning.

The spatial sensitivity of the spectral diversity-biodiversity relationship: an experimental test in a prairie grassland								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				28	2			541	556		10.1002/eap.1669			MAR 2018	2018	Remote sensing has been used to detect plant biodiversity in a range of ecosystems based on the varying spectral properties of different species or functional groups. However, the most appropriate spatial resolution necessary to detect diversity remains unclear. At coarse resolution, differences among spectral patterns may be too weak to detect. In contrast, at fine resolution, redundant information may be introduced. To explore the effect of spatial resolution, we studied the scale dependence of spectral diversity in a prairie ecosystem experiment at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota, USA. Our study involved a scaling exercise comparing synthetic pixels resampled from high-resolution images within manipulated diversity treatments. Hyperspectral data were collected using several instruments on both ground and airborne platforms. We used the coefficient of variation (CV) of spectral reflectance in space as the indicator of spectral diversity and then compared CV at different scales ranging from 1mm(2) to 1m(2) to conventional biodiversity metrics, including species richness, Shannon's index, Simpson's index, phylogenetic species variation, and phylogenetic species evenness. In this study, higher species richness plots generally had higher CV. CV showed higher correlations with Shannon's index and Simpson's index than did species richness alone, indicating evenness contributed to the spectral diversity. Correlations with species richness and Simpson's index were generally higher than with phylogenetic species variation and evenness measured at comparable spatial scales, indicating weaker relationships between spectral diversity and phylogenetic diversity metrics than with species diversity metrics. High resolution imaging spectrometer data (1mm(2) pixels) showed the highest sensitivity to diversity level. With decreasing spatial resolution, the difference in CV between diversity levels decreased and greatly reduced the optical detectability of biodiversity. The optimal pixel size for distinguishing diversity in these prairie plots appeared to be around 1mm to 10cm, a spatial scale similar to the size of an individual herbaceous plant. These results indicate a strong scale-dependence of the spectral diversity-biodiversity relationships, with spectral diversity best able to detect a combination of species richness and evenness, and more weakly detecting phylogenetic diversity. These findings can be used to guide airborne studies of biodiversity and develop more effective large-scale biodiversity sampling methods.

The AMF characteristics in relation to specific banana varieties, soils and seasons are carried out. This baseline data has global use for mycorrhizal applications in the crop. Spore density and percentage root colonization in relation to soil fertility parameters, seasons and soil series, along with other ecological parameters are assessed as per standard methods. Altogether 14 different AMF species of 13 different banana varieties, in terms of spore density and percentage colonization from 47 different soil series of South India are discovered. Among the 14 AMF species observed, Dentiscutata nigra is a new report in banana. Shannon's diversity index and Simpson's index over seasons are measured. Evenness in AM fungal population in banana fields in the monsoon was higher than that of summer. Presence of over 30% AMF root colonization in majority of banana varieties revealed its significance in the crop.		[Nidheesh, K. S.; Ray, J.

Microbiota of field-collected <i>Ixodes</i> <i>scapularis</i> and <i>Dermacentor</i> <i>variabilis</i> from eastern and southern Ontario, Canada								TICKS AND TICK-BORNE DISEASES				9	2			235	244		10.1016/j.ttbdis.2017.09.009			FEB 2018	2018	The microbiota of hard ticks has been an area of growing interest due to the potential role that the broader microbial community may play in pathogen carriage and transmission. In the last two decades, Ontario, Canada has experienced rapid changes in the risk of tick-borne disease, primarily due to the range expansion of Ixodes scapularis. Another human-biter, Dermacentor variabilis, is a longstanding resident of the province, but currently poses minimal risk of pathogen transmission. To examine the microbiota of these two species, we collected adult and nymphal I. scapularis and D. variabilis from the eastern and southern regions of the province via tick dragging, and conducted next generation sequencing of 19 samples (composed of 45 ticks) via Illumina MiSeq. A total of 1400469 sequences were detected (median 69118/sample; range 23350-155227). The most abundant families of bacteria were unclassified Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae for both I. scapularis and D. variabilis. No significant differences in the relative abundances of any phylum, class, order, family or genus were detected between locations (east vs south), sex, life stage or tick species. There were no differences in community membership or structure based on unifrac and AMOVA analyses. Female and male ticks had lower microbial diversity when compared to nymphs, based on the Simpson's index and Shannon evenness index. The findings of our study differ from previous studies of these tick species conducted in other geographic areas, and highlight the potential role geography and related ecological factors may have in shaping the tick microbiota.

Sapling plants as part of the undergrowth plants are an inseparable part of the forest ecosystem and play an important role in the sustainability of the forests, including forests in the tropics. We examine the structure and composition of sapling plants in Bantimurung Bulusaraung National Park, Balloci resort, in two areas, which are Bukit Batu Putih and Gunung Bulusaraung. This national park is one of the protected areas in Province of South Sulawesi, Indonesia. Species with the highest importance value index in Bukit Batu Putih are Tabernaemontana sphaerocarpa, Homalium guianense, Micromelum minutum, Lepiniopsis ternatensis and Melicope lunu-ankenda with a total of 191.84%, while the lowest are Planchonella firma, Coffea sp., Matthaea sancta, Ficus pumila and Syzygium ingens with a total of 1.58%. Species in Gunung Bulusaraung with the highest important value index are Daemonorops longipes, Actephilla excelsa, Memecylon paniculatum, Galbulimina belgraveana and Ficus gul with a total of 126.31%, while the lowest are Arenga pinnata, Pterospermum celebicum, Ficus ampelas, Antidesma bunius and Cyathea contaminans with a total of 2.68%. The value of Shannon-wiener diversity, Simpson's diversity index, species richness, Pielou's evenness index, and Rarefaction in Bukit Batu Putih is lower than that of Gunung Bulusaraung and only Simpson's dominance index is higher indicating of lower species diversity in Bukit Putih area. The value of similarity index between Bukit Batu Putih and Gunung Bulusaraung is 23.71% indicating that these two areas have a high difference in the structure and composition of sapling plant vegetation.

Furthermore, it aims to measure forest biodiversity using established formulae for tree species diversity index, richness, evenness and accumulative curve. Design/methodology/approach Field data were collected, including stratification of forest sample plots. Statistical analysis of the data was carried out, and locally appropriate allometric equations were applied for biomass estimation. Findings Representative circular 556 forest sample plots of 1,000 m(2) contained 13,135 trees belonging to nine tree species with a total aboveground biomass of 12,887 tonnes. Sixty-eight per cent of the trees were found between 2,600 and 3,400 masl; approximately 63 per cent had a diameter at breast height equal to 30 cm, and 45 per cent were less than 12 m in height. The Shannon diversity index was 1.82, and Simpson's index of diversity was 0.813. Research limitations/implications Rough terrain, long distances, harsh weather conditions and location of forest in steep narrow valleys presented challenges for the field crews, and meant that fieldwork took longer than planned. Practical implications Estimating biomass in Gilgit-Baltistan's forests using locally developed allometric equations will provide transparency in estimates of forest reference levels, National Forest Monitoring System in Pakistan and devising Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation national strategies and for effective implementation.

In order to address the trade-offs between these two ES over time, we performed a retrospective study at compartment level in the Pinus sylvestris forests of the Spanish Central Mountain System. Archival data from Management Plans for eight forests with contrasting silvicultural systems (uniform shelterwood system, group shelterwood system, irregular shelterwood system,) and three different site quality classes were analysed. Timber production was assessed through stand volume, harvested timber volume and a stand volume index. Biodiversity was examined through structural diversity (Gini index, Shannon tree size diversity index, Simpson's reciprocal index and evenness index, all applied to diameter classes) and the abundance of large living trees. For all silvicultural systems investigated, stand volume and harvested timber volume have grown since the beginning of the management plans (beginning of the twentieth century in some forests). The largest yields of timber corresponded to the best quality sites with more intensive silvicultural treatments (uniform and group shelterwood systems). The uniform shelterwood system showed lower figures for structural diversity, though not always significant. The best site qualities maintained notable structural diversity values, even under the most intensive management system. The application of the different management systems over decades has revealed a synergy between timber production and structural diversity, particularly in those systems maintaining more than one age class, although results are conditioned by forest harvesting history. The interaction between historical silvicultural treatment and site quality has been identified as an important source of information to understand forest dynamics and functioning of ES provision.

We studied 24 20 m x 20 m quadrats of natural secondary forest in the southern Taihang Mountains. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and two-way indicator hydrocarbon analysis were used to analyse the relationship between community vegetation and environmental factors. The CCA showed that 13 terrain and soil variables shared 68.17% of the total variance. The principal environmental variables, based on the most parsimonious CCA model, were (in order) elevation, soil total N, soil gravel content, slope, soil electrical conductivity, and pH. Samples were clustered into four forest types, with forest diversity affected by elevation, nutrients, and water gradients. Topographical variables affected forest assembly more than soil variables. Species diversity was evaluated using the Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's diversity, and Pielou's evenness indexes. The environmental factors that affected species distribution had different effects on species diversity. The vegetation-environment relationship in the southern region was different than the central region of the Taihang Mountains, and vegetation restoration was at an early stage. The terrain of the southern region, especially elevation and slope, should be considered for vegetation restoration and conservation.

Juniperus constitutes important vegetation associations in the Himalayan highlands that have significant ecological and socioeconomic importance. This research investigated the distribution pattern, community structure, and ecosystem services provided by Juniperus-dominated subalpine vegetation in the upper Neelum Valley, Pakistan. Vegetation attributes and geographical characteristics were systematically recorded at 4 selected sites. Two species of Juniperus, Juniperus communis L. and J. excelsa M. Bieb., were found to have average importance values of 23.4 and 20.02%, respectively. J. excelsa showed an average basal area of 0.30 m(2) ha(-1) and an average stem density of 46.95 ha(-1); J. communis had an average basal area of 0.25 m(2) ha(-1) and an average stem density of 33.21 ha(-1). A total of 56 Juniperus-associated plant species from 29 families were recorded, with Asteraceae as the dominant family, followed by Lamiaceae, Polygonaceae, Rosaceae, Caryophyllaceae, and Apiaceae. Predominant associated species included Thymus linearis, Aster falconeri, Rosa webbiana, Berberis lyceum, Anagallis arvensis, Rumex nepalensis, Poa alpina, Bistorta affinis, and Iris hookeriana. The calculated average values were Shannon's diversity, 3.07; Simpson's diversity, 0.94; species richness, 1.11; species evenness, 0.90; and maturity index, 45.90. Hemicryptophytes were the dominant lifeform in the area (57.14%), and microphylls (46.42%) were the dominant leaf type. Overgrazing and fuelwood cutting were identified as serious threats to both Juniperus species. Restoration of the degraded juniper stands through collective efforts by government and local communities and regular monitoring is recommended.

J	Yuan, Zi-Qiang								Factors affecting lucerne-rich vegetation under revegetation in a semi-arid environment								ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING				108				249	254		10.1016/j.ecoleng.2017.08.030			NOV 2017	2017	Understanding the factors contributing to spatial variation in the functional structure of plant is crucial for revegetation and ecosystem management of the Loess Plateau, China. As one of the measures in the "Grain for Green" project, lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) has been widely planted in this seriously-eroded region to improve revegetation and conserve soil and water. However, information on how environmental factors influence the long-term development of lucerne-rich vegetation is scarce. This study aimed to identify the main environmental variables controlling the lucerne-rich vegetation through multivariate analyses. Vegetation and soil surveys were performed in 28 fields containing 11-year-old lucerne. Vegetation variables were total aboveground biomass, aboveground biomass of lucerne, total cover, lucerne cover, total abundance, species richness, Shannon-Wiener's diversity index, Simpson's predominance index, and evenness index. Topographic variables were slope, slope position, and slope aspect. Soil variables were soil total nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), available P, mineral N, organic carbon (SOC), moisture content (SMC), microbial biomass C and N. Analyses verified that vegetation variables, soil variables, and topographic variables were significantly correlated. One of the most important factors that influence lucerne revegetation process was SOC. SMC, total P, slope, and mineral N were also key factors that influenced vegetation variables. The obtained values of total aboveground biomass and cover were still high after 11 years planting. The fields that in the north-and south-facing slopes did not significantly differ in terms of total cover, and total and lucerne aboveground biomass. The results suggest that soil properties (such as SOC, TN, and mineral N, etc.) and topographic variables (i.e., slope) interacted with each other and acted on plants simultaneously in the lucerne-rich vegetation. To revegetation the degraded ecosystems by lucerne planting, we should consider the effects of the changes of soil properties, such as SOC, SMC, and soil P, on vegetation development.

Our study aimed to classify G. macrophylla communities and to find out the impact of topographic and soil factors on their diversity and distribution in Dongling mountain meadow, Beijing, China. Seventy five samples in 15 transects separated by 50m distance in altitude along an elevation gradient (1592-2298m) were established by quadrate method. TWINSAPN and CCA were used for classification and ordination, respectively. Six diversity indices (Species richness, Shannon-Weiner heterogeneity, Simpson's index, Hill's index, Pielou evenness and McIntosh evenness) were used to analyze the pattern of species diversity and polynomial regression analysis was used to establish their relationship with environmental variables. TWINSPAN classified G. macrophylla communities into 8 types and CCA indicated that soil pH, soil temperature, soil type, disturbance, total N, total K, Mg and Zn were significantly related to these communities. Elevation was the most significant factor that affecting the diversity and distribution of G. macrophylla communities Significant effect of environment, topography and disturbance to meadow communities of G. macrophylla highly suggests some important measures such as uprooting restriction, tourism limitation in meadow area, monitoring of functional diversity, fertilization, irrigation, cloning and cultivation to protect and conserve it and its communities to be used in medicine industry.

RESPONSES OF SMALL MAMMAL COMMUNITIES TO PINYON-JUNIPER HABITAT TREATMENTS								WESTERN NORTH AMERICAN NATURALIST				77	3			331	342		10.3398/064.077.0306			OCT 2017	2017	Small mammals should be considered in wildlife management decisions because they are an important component of ecosystems. We examined small mammal population abundances (N) on 4 habitat treatment types in Colo rado pinyon pine (Pinus edulis)-Utah juniper (Juniperus osteosperma) woodlands on the Uncompahgre Plateau, Montrose, Colorado. We trapped small mammals in Sherman live traps on 4 habitat treatment types-including 2 types of management treatments (chaining, roller chop), sites with high drought-related mortality of pinyon pine, and sites of mature pinyon-juniper (PJ) woodland-on 3 mesas. We modeled detection probability of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) and least chipmunks (Tamias minimus) as a function of 4 treatment types on 3 mesas during 2 trapping periods by using Huggins closed mark-recapture models. A variance components analysis was conducted to obtain abundance shrinkage estimates and to separate spatial process variance from the sampling variance to calculate the percent of variation in abundance estimates explained by treatment type, mesa, and trapping period. Abundance estimates were higher for deer mice and least chipmunks on chaining and roller chop treatment sites than on mature PJ woodland and pinyon pine natural mortality sites. The highest percent of variation in abundance estimates was explained by treatment type for deer mice (33.67%) and least chipmunks (61.45%) and secondarily by mesa for deer mice (21.64%). We calculated species diversity using Shannon's, Simpson's, Pielou's evenness, and species richness indices, and we used analysis of variance to test for significant differences (P < 0.05) in species composition. Species diversity and richness were higher on natural mortality sites than on chaining, roller chop, and mature woodland sites. Our results indicate that chaining and roller chop habitat treatments within PJ woodlands have a positive impact on deer mouse and least chipmunk abundances, whereas natural mortality and chaining treatments have a positive impact on small mammal composition.

J	Zhu, Li-xia; Xiao, Qian; Shen, Yu-feng; Li, Shi-qing								Microbial functional diversity responses to 2 years since biochar application in silt-loam soils on the Loess Plateau								ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY				144				578	584		10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.06.075			OCT 2017	2017	The structure and function of soil microbial communities have been widely used as indicators of soil quality and fertility. The effect of biochar application on carbon sequestration has been studied, but the effect on soil microbial functional diversity has received little attention. We evaluated effects of biochar application on the functional diversities of microbes in a loam soil. The effects of biochar on microbial activities and related processes in the 0-10 and 10-20 cm soil layers were determined in a two-year experiment in maize field on the Loess Plateau in China. Low-pyrolysis biochar produced from maize straw was applied into soils at rates of 0 (BC0), 10 (BC10) and 30 (BC30) t ha(-1). Chemical analysis indicated that the biochar did not change the pH, significantly increased the amounts of organic carbon and nitrogen, and decreased the amount of mineral nitrogen and the microbial quotient. The biochar significantly decreased average well colour development (AWCD) values in Biolog EcoPlates (TM) for both layers, particularly for the rate of 10 t ha(-1). Biochar addition significantly decreased substrate richness (S) except for BC30 in the 0-10 cm layer. Effects of biochar on the Shannon-Wiener index (H) and Simpson's dominance (D) were not significant, except for a significant increase in evenness index (E) in BC10 in the 10-20 cm layer. A principal component analysis clearly differentiated the treatments, and microbial use of six categories of substrates significantly decreased in both layers after biochar addition, although the use of amines and amides did not differ amongst the three treatments in the deeper layer. Maize above ground dry biomass and height did not differ significantly amongst the treatments, and biochar had no significant effect on nitrogen uptake by maize seedlings. H was positively correlated with AWCD, and negatively with pH. AWCD was positively correlated with mineral N and negatively with pH. Our results indicated that shifts in soil microbial functional diversity affected by biochar were not effective indicators of soil quality in earlier maize growth periods in this region.

J	Uddin, M. D. Nazim; Robinson, Randall William								Responses of plant species diversity and soil physical-chemicalmicrobial properties to <i>Phragmites australis</i> invasion along a density gradient								SCIENTIFIC REPORTS				7						11007	10.1038/s41598-017-11205-0			SEP 8 2017	2017	The invasion of ecosystems by strongly colonising plants such as Phragmites australis is viewed as one of the greatest threats to plant diversity and soil properties. This study compared a range of diversity measures including soil properties and mycorrhizal potential under different degrees of Phragmites density among three populations in coastal wetland, Victoria, Australia. Species richness, evenness and Shanon-Wiener index had significantly higher values in low degree of Phragmites density in all populations. Higher densities had the lowest diversity, with Shannon-Wiener index = 0 and Simpson's index = 1 indicating its mono-specificity. Significant alterations in soil properties associated with different degrees of Phragmites density were noticed. These had interactive effects (population x density) on water content, dehydrogenase activity, microbial biomass (C, N and P) but not on pH, electrical conductivity, phenolics, organic carbon, and spore density. Furthermore, the study elucidated decrease of competitive abilities of native plants, by interfering with formation of mycorrhizal associations and biomass. Overall, our results suggest that significant ecological alterations in vegetation and soil variables (including mycorrhizal potential) were strongly dependent on Phragmites density. Such changes may lead to an important role in process of Phragmites invasion through disruption of functional relationships amongst those variables.		[Uddin, M. D.

J	Uddin, Md N.; Robinson, Randall W.								Changes associated with <i>Phragmites australis</i> invasion in plant community and soil properties: A study on three invaded communities in a wetland, Victoria, Australia								LIMNOLOGICA				66				24	30		10.1016/j.limno.2017.07.006			SEP 2017	2017	Phragmites australis invasion is altering plant communities and therefore, soil properties have been changed significantly. This study compared the diversity among three communities in a wetland to assess the impact of invasion by Phragmites and the associated impact on soil properties. Three diversity indices, species richness (S), evenness (E) and Shanon-Weiner index (H) had significantly higher values in uninvaded plots compared to invaded in all the communities. Invaded plots had the lowest diversity, with H = 0 and Simpson's index (D) = 1, (i.e. they were monospecific). These results support the idea that a reduction in diversity can be expected in wetlands colonized by Phragmites. Phragmites invasion significantly increased soil moisture, EC, phenolics, organic carbon, dehydrogenase activity and microbial biomass (C, N, P) with reduction of pH and arbuscular mycorrhizae fungi spore density compared with uninvaded zones. In addition, the study of antifungal phytochemistry of Phragmites elucidated the decrease of the competitive abilities of native plant Melaleuca ericifolia by interfering with formation of mycorrhizal associations and biomass. Our results suggest that Phragmites invasion has caused significant ecological alterations in communities by demonstrating a combined effect to plant diversity and soil variables.

It is the only kind of sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh which is surrounded by water bodies and most of the land covered with thatch grasses. The primary objective of the present study was to collect preliminary data on the insect diversity in this sanctuary. For this, the data were collected in four habitats viz. grassland, woodland, river bank and Jeep ghat camp area during February 04-07, 2015. The findings were analysed using Shannon index, Simpson index, Buzas and Gibson's evenness measure, Berger-Parker index and Fisher-alpha index. During the survey undertaken, 44 species of insects belonging to 10 orders and 25 families were documented. Lepidoptera represented by 9 species showed the highest species richness as per Shannon index followed by Coleoptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera represented by 6, 15, 5 and 4 species respectively. However, Simpson's diversity index calculated the highest species richness of Coleoptera followed by Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera and Hymenoptera. The maximum number of species inhabited in the grassland (22). Among the habitats studied, the highest species richness was found in woodland followed by riverbank, grassland and the camp area. Ceratosolen solmsi marchali was estimated as the most abundant insect species in camp area, Distoleon tetragrammicus and Schizodactylus monstrosus in riverbank, Globitermes globosus and Acrida bicolour in grassland and Mycalesis heri in woodland habitat. Though, it was a preliminary survey species like yellow winged grasshopper Gastrimargus musicus, sand dune cricket S. monstrosus and globoid nest termite G. globosus can be pictured as potential flagship insects in the sanctuary. Besides, it showed the variation of diversity in entomofauna among the habitats indicating habitat specific dependence of the insect assembly in the sanctuary.

The results showed that between two watersheds showed that all of the contagion index, Shannon's diversity index, and patch cohesion index exhibited an ascending trend in the Dalihe watershed, and a descending trend in the Hailiutuhe watershed. In the Dalihe watershed, only Shannon's diversity index had a very significantly negative correlation with the runoff, whereas in the Hailiutuhe watershed, the contagion index had a significantly negative correlation with the runoff, and all of the Shannon's diversity index, the Shannon's evenness index, and the Simpson's evenness index had a significantly positive correlation with the runoff. In respect of correlation of sediment with landscape pattern, the sediment had a very significantly negative correlation only with Shannon's diversity index in the Dalihe watershed, whereas in the Hailiutuhe watershed, the sediment had a significantly negative correlation with all of the number of patches, the patch density, and the landscape shape index, and a very significantly positive correlation with the aggregation index. The importance of each landscape index in the regression equation and the positive or negative correlations indicated that erosion in watersheds could be reduced by strengthening the control function of the dominant patch, thoroughly improving the evenness of the landscape patch types, enriching the landscape types, reducing the physical connectivity between patches, and enhancing the degree of aggregation in landscape patches.

The transitional zone between biomes in desert ecosystems, however, has received little attention in that regard. In this study, we conducted a quantitative field survey (including 187 sampling plots) in a 40-km(2) study area to determine the spatial pattern of plant species diversity and analyze the influencing factors in a Gobi Desert within the Heihe River Basin, Northwest China. A total of 42 plant species belonging to 16 families and 39 genera were recorded. Shrub and semi-shrub species generally represented the major part of the plant communities (covering 90% of the land surface), while annual and perennial herbaceous species occupied a large proportion of the total recorded species (71%). Patrick richness index (R), Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H'), Simpson's dominance index (D), and Pielou's evenness index (J) were all moderately spatially variable, and the variability increased with increasing sampling area. The semivariograms for R and H' were best fitted with Gaussian models while the semivariograms for D and J were best fitted with exponential models. Nugget-to-still ratios indicated a moderate spatial autocorrelation for R, H', and D while a strong spatial autocorrelation was observed for J. The spatial patterns of R and H' were closely related to the geographic location within the study area, with lower values near the oasis and higher values near the mountains. However, there was an opposite trend for D. R, H', and D were significantly correlated with elevation, soil texture, bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and total porosity (P < 0.05). Generally speaking, locations at higher elevations tended to have higher species richness and diversity and the higher elevations were characterized by higher values in sand and gravel contents, bulk density, and saturated hydraulic conductivity and also by lower values in total porosity. Furthermore, spatial variability of plant species diversity was dependent on the sampling area.

In this study, we conducted a survey investigation in the field and a seed germination experiment in the laboratory to explore the characteristics of soil seed banks at various geomorphic positions of longitudinal sand dunes in the Gurbantunggut Desert, China. Totally, 17 plant species belonging to 17 genera and 9 families were identified in soil seed banks, and 35 plant species belonging to 34 genera and 17 families were identified in aboveground vegetation. Plant species richness in soil seed banks decreased with increasing soil depth. The highest species richness was presented in the upper slope of the windward slope and the lowest species richness was presented in the base of the windward slope. There was no significant difference in seed density of soil seed banks among the examined seven geomorphic positions. The highest seed density occurred in the lower slope of the leeward slope while the lowest occurred in the crest. Moreover, seed density decreased with increasing soil depth, being the highest in the upper soil layer (0-2 cm). For both soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation, there was no significant difference in Simpson's diversity index among the seven geomorphic positions; however, Shannon-Wiener diversity index and Pielou's evenness index showed significant differences among the seven geomorphic positions. Those results showed that although there was no significant difference in seed density of soil seed banks among the seven geomorphic positions, the geomorphic positions significantly affected the species richness, diversity and distribution of soil seed banks. Therefore, understanding the characteristics of soil seed banks at different geomorphic positions of sand dunes is essential to vegetation restoration or reestablishment. Furthermore, the Jaccard's similarity coefficients of plant species between soil seed banks and aboveground vegetation at the seven geomorphic positions were low, suggesting that vegetation restoration or reestablishment processes should be promoted through adding seeds to surface layers.

Surface water samples were collected from 11 different stations from 0 to 10 km offshore with the help of a mechanized trawler. Parameters like tintinnid species enumeration, zooplankton biomass, phytoplankton concentration (total chlorophyll) and abundance, sea surface temperature (SST), pH, transparency, salinity, dissolved oxygen (DO), total phosphate, silicate and nitrate were analysed. A total of 20 different tintinnid species (16 agglomerated +4 non-agglomerated) belonging to 6 genera were recorded from the study area with seasonal variation in tintinnid diversity, i.e. higher in summer (total 2745 individual/l) compared to winter (total 1191 individual/l). Tintinnopsis was the most dominant genus during both the seasons, i.e. 2100 individual/l in summer and 727 individual/l in winter, contributing about 76 and 61% population for the respective seasons. The correlation between species and water quality parameters showed that Tintinnopsis sp. abundance was significantly regulated by nitrate concentration, salinity, dissolved oxygen, water transparency and pH. However, the mentioned hydrological parameters were not the only factors regulating the tintinnid abundance. Tintinnid abundance was also found to be positively related with transparency (r = 0.732) and salinity (r = 0.524) and moderately related with dissolved oxygen (r = 0.488) whereas strong negative relation (at p = 0.05) was established between tintinnid abundance with nitrate (r = -0.681) and pH (r = -0.561). Bray-Curtis cluster analysis of tintinnid species showed more than 60% similarity. Shannon's diversity index (H'), Simpson's evenness index (D) and Margalef's species richness index were found to be higher in summer, i.e. 1.61, 0.729 and 1.612, compared to the winter season, i.e. 1.139, 0.597 and 1.268. k-dominance curve showed maximum abundance of Tintinnopsis baltica in winter and Tintinnopsis gracilis in summer. Principal component analysis (PCA) was analysed to find out the environmental variables affecting different tintinnid species diversity. A significant spatiotemporal variation in Tintinnid population distribution was observed from two-way ANOVA. The results reflect significant seasonal (F = 840.0), spatial (F = 47.3) and interactive variation (F = 71.2) among the ciliate microzooplankton at n = 66, p = 0.001. High chlorophyll content and phytoplankton population in summer indicated that tintinnid diversity in the season was positively influenced by producer community in coastal waters of Digha.

We introduce the generalized Simpson's entropy as a measure of diversity and investigate its properties. We show that it has many useful features and can be used as a measure of biodiversity. Moreover, unlike most commonly used diversity indices, it has unbiased estimators, which allow for sound estimation of the diversity of poorly sampled, rich communities.

J	Yu, Zhengda; Wang, Hui; Meng, Jiao; Miao, Mingsheng; Kong, Qiang; Wang, Renqing; Liu, Jian								Quantifying the responses of biological indices to rare macroinvertebrate taxa exclusion: Does excluding more rare taxa cause more error?								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				7	5			1583	1591		10.1002/ece3.2798			MAR 2017	2017	Including or excluding rare taxa in bioassessment is a controversial topic, which essentially affects the reliability and accuracy of the result. In the present paper, we hypothesize that biological indices such as Shannon-Wiener index, Simpson's index, Margalef index, evenness, BMWP (biological monitoring working party), and ASPT (Average Score Per Taxon) respond differently to rare taxa exclusion. To test this hypothesis, a benthic macroinvertebrate data set based on recent fifteen-year studies in China was built for suppositional plot analyses. A field research was conducted in the Nansi Lake to perform related analyses. The results of suppositional plot simulations showed that Simpson's index placed more weight on common taxa than any other studied indices, followed by Shannon-Wiener index which remained a high value with the exclusion of rare taxa. The results indicated that there was not much of effect on Simpson's index and Shannon-Wiener index when rare taxa were excluded. Rare taxa played an important role in Margalef index and BMWP than in other indices. Evenness showed an increase trend, while ASPT varied inconsistently with the exclusion of rare taxa. Results of the field study also indicated that rare taxa had few impacts on the Shannon-Wiener index. By examining the relationships between the rare taxa and biological indices in our study, it is suggested that including the rare taxa when using BMWP and excluding them in the proposed way (e.g., fixed-count subsampling) to calculate Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's index could raise the efficiency and reduce the biases in the bioassessment of freshwater ecosystems.

J	MacDonald, Zachary G.; Nielsen, Scott E.; Acorn, John H.								Negative relationships between species richness and evenness render common diversity indices inadequate for assessing long-term trends in butterfly diversity								BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				26	3			617	629		10.1007/s10531-016-1261-0			MAR 2017	2017	Species richness and evenness, the two principle components of species diversity, are frequently used to describe variation in species assemblages in space and time. Compound indices, including variations of both the Shannon-Wiener index and Simpson's index, are assumed to intelligibly integrate species richness and evenness into all-encompassing measures. However, the efficacy of compound indices is disputed by the possibility of inverse relationships between species richness and evenness. Past studies have assessed relationships between various diversity measures across survey locations for a variety of taxa, often finding species richness and evenness to be inversely related. Butterflies are one of the most intensively monitored taxa worldwide, but have been largely neglected in such studies. Long-term butterfly monitoring programs provide a unique opportunity for analyzing how trends in species diversity relate to habitat and environmental conditions. However, analyzing trends in butterfly diversity first requires an assessment of the applicability of common diversity measures to butterfly assemblages. To accomplish this, we quantified relationships between butterfly diversity measures estimated from 10 years of butterfly population data collected in the North Saskatchewan River Valley in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. Species richness and evenness were inversely related within the butterfly assemblage. We conclude that species evenness may be used in conjunction with richness to deepen our understandings of assemblage organization, but combining these two components within compound indices does not produce measures that consistently align with our intuitive sense of species diversity.

J	Zhang, Shanghong; Fan, Weiwei; Li, Yueqiang; Yi, Yujun								The influence of changes in land use and landscape patterns on soil erosion in a watershed								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				574				34	45		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.09.024			JAN 1 2017	2017	It is very important to have a good understanding of the relation between soil erosion and landscape patterns so that soil and water conservation in river basins can be optimized. In this study, this relationship was explored, using the Liusha River Watershed, China, as a case study. A distributed water and sediment model based on the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was developed to simulate soil erosion from different land use types in each sub-basin of the Liusha River Watershed. Observed runoff and sediment data from 1985 to 2005 and land use maps from 1986, 1995, and 2000 were used to calibrate and validate the model. The erosion modulus for each sub-basin was calculated from SWAT model results using the different land use maps and 12 landscape indices were chosen and calculated to describe the land use in each sub-basin for the different years. The variations in instead of the absolute amounts of the erosion modulus and the landscape indices for each sub-basin were used as the dependent and independent variables, respectively, for the regression equations derived from multiple linear regression. The results indicated that the variations in the erosion modulus were closely related to changes in the large patch index, patch cohesion index, modified Simpson's evenness index, and the aggregation index. From the regression equation and the corresponding landscape indices, it was found that watershed erosion can be reduced by decreasing the physical connectivity between patches, improving the evenness of the landscape patch types, enriching landscape types, and enhancing the degree of aggregation between the landscape patches. These findings will be useful for water and soil conservation and for optimizing the management of watershed landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Urbina, Mauricio A.								Temporal variation on environmental variables and pollution indicators in marine sediments under sea Salmon farming cages in protected and exposed zones in the Chilean inland Southern Sea								SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT				573				841	853		10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.08.166			DEC 15 2016	2016	The impacts of any activity on marine ecosystems will depend on the characteristics of the receptor medium and its resilience to external pressures. Salmon farming industry develops along a constant gradient of hydrodynamic conditions in the south of Chile. However, the influence of the hydrodynamic characteristics (weak or strong) on the impacts of intensive salmon farming is still poorly understood. This one year study evaluates the impacts of salmon farming on the marine sediments of both protected and exposed marine zones differing in their hydrodynamic characteristics. Six physico-chemical, five biological variables and seven indexes of marine sediments status were evaluated under the salmon farming cages and control sites. Our results identified a few key variables and indexes necessary to accurately evaluate the salmon farming impacts on both protected and exposed zones. Interestingly, the ranking of importance of the variables and the temporality of the observed changes, varied depending on the hydrodynamic characteristics. Biological variables (nematodes abundance) and environmental indexes (Simpson's dominance, Shannon's diversity and Pielou evenness) are the first to reflect detrimental impacts under the salmon farming cages. Then the physico-chemical variables such as redox, sulphurs and phosphorus in both zones also show detrimental impacts. Based. on the present results we propose that the hydrodynamic regime is an important driver of the magnitude and temporality of the effects of salmon farming on marine sediments. The variables and indexes that best reflect the effects of salmon farming, in both protected and exposed zones, are also described. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The aim of this study was to characterize the diversity and structure of Caatinga vegetation areas with different histories of use in northeastern Brazil. Two areas were used: 1) preserved with no historical evidence of deforestation for agricultural purposes; and 2) regenerated after cultivation of Opuntia ficus-indica Mill., approximately 30 years ago. In each area, vegetation of 12 plots was collected, considering all individuals with circumference at 1.30 m above ground level (CAP) >= 6.0 cm. Collected species were classified according to dispersal strategy into the categories of anemochoric, zoochoric, and autochoric. For the analysis of a diversity, species richness, Shannon index, Pielou's evenness, and Simpson's index were used. beta diversity was evaluated using hierarchical cluster analysis. Structural analysis using density, basal area, and value of importance (VI) was conducted. A comparison between the diameter distributions of the areas was performed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Indicator species analysis (ISA) was conducted to identify the species preferences per area. The relationship of beta diversity with the differences in the composition of species and their densities were analyzed with TWINSPAN. The two areas showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in richness, density, and basal area. There was no significant difference in diversity. Cluster analysis indicated the formation of two floristic groups (40% dissimilarity), which was corroborated by TWINSPAN and ISA. The regenerating area after 30 years of abandonment showed similar species diversity as did the preserved area; however, floristic composition, species richness, density, and basal area did not recover. The similarity in diameter distributions between areas indicated that the abandoned area is recovering its regenerative capability.

The study area comprised approximately 166 000 ha in the Kouilou Departement, Republic of Congo, a section of land targeted for extensive future development. In total 156 forest sample sites were surveyed using the Braun-Blanquet method of phytosociology. Diversity of each plant community was expressed in terms of species richness; Shannon-Wiener index; exponent of Shannon-Wiener index; evenness; Fisher's alpha; Simpson's index; and inverse Simpson index. Eleven plant communities were described and mapped at a much finer scale than has been done previously. The communities were arranged along two gradients: a degraded - relatively intact gradient and a wet - dry gradient. The least degraded communities, and consequently those with the highest conservation value, were the swamp forests and the koum forest. Overall, the values reported for the diversity parameters in the current study were within the range reported for other tropical forests in Central Africa. The study revealed a gradient between the coast (west) and the Mayombe mountain range (east) in plant diversity linked to topography and climate with plant diversity lowest at the coast. Furthermore, plant diversity was negatively related to the distance to human infrastructure. The forest communities appear to be fairly resilient to past anthropogenic disturbances, however, there is no historical analogue to the more severe types of forest destruction associated with some of the future developments anticipated, such as mechanized logging or mining.

The forests were as follows: a river valley monsoon forest, semi-humid evergreen broad-leaved forest, monsoon evergreen broad-leaved forest, mid-mountain humid evergreen broad-leaved forest, summit mossy dwarf forest, and warm needle-leaved forest. Owing to the variation in microenvironment, forest structure (tree density, mean height, mean diameter at breast height, mean basal area at breast height) and tree diversity indices (the number of species, Margalef richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity, Simpson's index, and Pielou's evenness) differed significantly among forest types but did not differ among sites. We recorded a total of 5155 canopy trees belonging to 204 tree species, 104 genera, and 50 families at three sites, and the co-occurrence of tree species between adjacent communities was higher. A clear forest community distribution along an altitudinal gradient suggested that elevation was important in tree species distribution. Ordination identified elevation, slope degree, slope position, soil pH, organic matter, total nitrogen, and available nitrogen as significant explanatory variables of tree species distribution and showed that elevation was more important than the rest of the environmental variables in affecting local woody plant distribution. Understanding relationships between tree species distribution and environmental factors in subtropical mountain forests of the Lower Lancang River Basin would enable us to apply these findings to forest management and vegetation restoration.

The congruences in water quality bioassessment based on diversity and biotic indices and using different taxonomic categories were also explored to find the best assessment method of water quality for the lake. All major structural characteristics of macrozoobenthic community, including species composition, abundance, biomass and four biomass-based diversity indices (Shannon's diversity, Simpson's diversity, Pielou's evenness and Simpson's evenness index) fluctuated significantly in season but in space. The above four abundance-based diversity indices plus abundance-based Margalef's richness index did not display significant spatial variations; and significant seasonal differences were found in three indices only. Water temperature was the key environmental factor responsible for macrozoobenthic spatio-temporal distribution patterns. Water quality assessed by Shannon's index (H-a') and biological pollution index (BPI) rather than the other four biotic indices were consistent with those by trophic state index (TSI). Results from chironomids and oligochaetes did not always agree to those from the whole community when H-a' or Hilsenhoff biotic index was applied to bioassessment. Therefore, combining multiple indices and avoiding a single taxonomic category to assess water quality are strongly recommended and in Mingzhu Lake using a mixture of H-a' and BPI will ensure the most effective investigation of water quality. Our results also show that the main structural characteristics of macrozoobenthic communities in the small lake may display consistent spatial patterns.

In this study, to assess the influence of JBLS202 and its main volatile compound indole on the bacterial community in the rhizosphere, we bacterized seeds of Kimchi cabbage, and then, the changes of bacterial diversity were investigated. The abundance of total bacteria and Pseudomonas spp. in the rhizosphere significantly increased compared to that in the nonbacterized rhizosphere. The abundance of Pseudomonas spp. in the soil on one side of the I-plate, which was exposed to volatiles from JBLS202, also significantly increased. Furthermore, synthetic indole also positively stimulated the abundance and growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas putida. The average well-color development (AWCD) values and utilization patterns of carbon source was also changed by the JBLS202 volatiles. Shannon's and Simpson's diversity and evenness indexes increased in the treated rhizosphere. Overall, the results suggest that seed bacterization with JBLS202 or exposure to volatiles from JBLS202/indole modulates the soil microbial community, which influenced microbial functional and metabolic diversity. This is the foremost report on the stimulatory effects of volatile compounds from JBLS202 on the rhizosphere microbiome. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The present study has led to the identification of the following species and species complex: Trichoderma atroviride P. Karst., Trichoderma citrinoviride Bissett, Trichoderma cremeum P. Chaverri & Samuels, Trichoderma gamsii Samuels & Druzhin., Trichoderma harzianum complex, Trichoderma koningii Oudem., Trichoderma koningiopsis Samuels, C. Suarez & H.C.

Lu, Druzhin. & Samuels), Trichoderma viride Schumach. and Trichoderma viridescens complex. Among them, T. viride was observed as the most abundant species (53 % of all isolates) in all the investigated locations. The Shannon's biodiversity index (H), evenness (E), and the Simpson's biodiversity index (D) calculations for each location showed that the highest species diversity and evenness were recorded for location A-Gorce Mountains (H'aEuro parts per thousand= 1.71, E = 0.82, D = 0.79). The preliminary screening of 119 Trichoderma strains for cellulolytic and xylanolytic activity showed the real potential of all Trichoderma species originating from wood with decay symptoms to produce cellulases and xylanases-the key enzymes in plant cell wall degradation.

Twenty wastewater samples were analysed, and from 667 isolates obtained, 32 were classified as biosurfactant producers as they reduced the surface tension of the culture medium (71.1 mN/m), with the lowest value of 32.1 mN/m observed. Certain isolates also formed stable emulsions with diesel, kerosene and mineral oils. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) analysis classified the biosurfactant producers into the Aeromonadaceae, Bacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Gordoniaceae and the Pseudomonadaceae families. In addition, numerous isolates carried the surfactin 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (sfp), rhamnosyltransferase subunit B (rhlB) and bacillomycin C (bamC) genes involved in the biosynthesis of surfactin, rhamnolipid and bacillomycin, respectively. While, biosurfactant-producing bacteria were found at all sampling points in the WWTP, the Simpson's diversity (1 - D) and the Shannon-Weaver (H) indices revealed an increase in bacterial diversity in the influent samples (0.8356 and 2.08), followed by the effluent (0.8 and 1.6094) and then the biological trickling filter (0.7901 and 1.6770) samples. Numerous biosurfactant-producing bacteria belonging to diverse genera are thus present throughout a WWTP.

Species Diversity and Stumpage Valuation of Timber Resources at Pasir Tengkorak Forest Reserve, Langkawi, Kedah								SAINS MALAYSIANA				45	3			355	363					MAR 2016	2016	Tropical forests are highly diverse and provide a great deal of economic value. They play an important role in providing goods and services which contribute to long-term social benefits in local communities. This study was carried out to examine the tree composition and estimate its economic value of timber resources in a lowland coastal forest. Four one ha plots were established in Pasir Tengkorak Forest Reserve in Langkawi, Kedah and the subplots measuring 10 x 10 m were established in each plot. All trees greater than 1 cm DBH (diameter at breast height) were identified and the parameters measured included tree height and diameter. The species diversity indices obtained for all four plots were relatively high. The Simpson's index of diversity ranges from 0.946 to 0.969, while the Shannon-Weiner index (H') ranges from 3.808 to 5.616. The Simpson's measure of evenness (1/D) ranges from 0.239 to 0.563 suggesting that species evenness in the four ha plots were low. Stumpage value of timber in the study area was quite high with average value of RM33,600.46 per ha. Regression analysis showed that the relationship between stumpage value and species diversity was significant at the 5% level.		[Abdullah, Hafidz; Noor, A. G.

An undulating topography and freckly soil properties cause ups and downs in tree diversity, composition and distribution. The study aimed to evaluate the effect of Gobind Sagar reservoir on soil properties relative to the distance from it and asess its effect on tree diversity, evenness and their distribution in tropical and subtropical forests. Based on data analysis it was found that the soil moisture and organic carbon decreased along with increasing distance from the reservoir. It played a significant role in varying tree diversity. The sites distributed within 0-2 km showed significantly higher a and beta-diversity indices. Tree species richness and diversity indices showed a strong correlation (p < 0.05) with soil moisture and organic carbon content. Simpson's and McIntosh evenness indices showed a strong negative correlation with soil bulk density. Indirect Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA) identified soil moisture and soil organic carbon as two major environmental gradients that influenced tree diversity and their distribution in five tropical and four subtropical forests in an upstream catchment of the reservoir. Mixed forests inhabited moist sites and Acacia-Pinus forests showed an inclination to dry areas. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) revealed that the tree species in tropical forests were mainly affected by driving forces such as soil moisture, organic carbon and bulk density whereas, in subtropical forest tree species were influenced by elevation, soil pH, EC and clay content.

Evidence for indirect effects of pesticide seed treatments on weed seed banks in maize and soybean								AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS & ENVIRONMENT				216				269	273		10.1016/j.agee.2015.10.008			JAN 15 2016	2016	Use of pesticide seed treatments (coating seeds with insecticides and/or fungicides) is a common practice in conventional maize and soybean production. Despite their widespread use, however, little is known about how this practice affects soil food webs and their associated ecosystem services. We conducted a two-year field experiment in central Pennsylvania, USA in which identical genotypes of maize (2013) and soybean (2014) were planted with and without pesticide seed treatments in a completely randomized design with five replications. We sampled the weed seed bank during both the corn (fall 2013) and soybean (summer 2014) phases of the rotation. After each sampling event, soil samples were transported to a temperature-controlled greenhouse facility and weed seed bank composition and density was assessed over a period of four months via the direct germination method. Seed bank data were analyzed with ANOVA and several multivariate techniques to determine the effect of pesticide seed treatments on seed bank density, diversity, and species composition. We hypothesized that pesticide seed treatments reduce the abundance of natural enemies (e.g., soil-dwelling seed predators and pathogens) that damage or destroy weed seeds in the soil, and therefore seed banks in treated plots would be larger and less diverse than those in untreated plots. In accordance with our hypothesis, weed seed banks were significantly less diverse in treated compared to untreated control plots (Shannon and Simpson's indices of diversity, p < 0.05). While not statistically significant, differences in mean germinable weed seed bank density, richness, and evenness were also in the direction that we hypothesized. These data provide the first evidence that we are aware of that weed seed banks, and hence weed populations, may be indirectly affected by pesticide seed treatments. Additional research will be necessary to determine the generality of these responses and their underlying mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Root colonization by AM and DSE fungi and AM spore numbers in the soil were assessed. AM fungal diversity indices like species richness, Shannon-Weiner index, Simpson's index, evenness, and Jaccard's index were determined. Relationships among the fungal and soil variables were also examined. All the species of Asparagus examined were colonized by both AM and DSE fungi, and these associations have been reported for the first time in four species. Root colonization by both the fungi varied significantly among Asparagus species and was related to each other and soil factors. The AM colonization patterns reported in four Asparagus species for the first time were characterized by either intermediate or Arum-Paris type. The AM fungal community was dominated by members belonging to the Glomerales and was significantly influenced by Asparagus species and soil factors. We conclude that Asparagus species could support a diverse AM fungal community even under pot conditions; however, certain AM fungal species are sensitive to changes in soil factors and host species.

Objectives: Examining the flora of KZNSS will allow a more fundamental understanding of the potential variability across remnant patches of this vegetation type, increasing the ability to accurately delimit KZNSS from adjacent similar vegetation types. Method: Floristic data were collected using quadrats and transects for three recognised KZNSS sites (Giba Gorge Environmental Precinct (GGEP), Inanda Mountain (IM) and Springside Nature Reserve (SSNR)), all within the EMA. Alpha diversity (Shannon's exponential and Simpson's inverse indices) and beta diversity measures were calculated and compared across all sites. An unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) analysis using the Jaccard index and a non-parametric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination were used to assess similarity amongst quadrats across the three sites. Results: One hundred and thirty-one plant species were found to occur in GGEP, 95 in IM and 121 in SSNR. However, of the total 193 species found to occur collectively (i. e. quadrat and transect data combined) across the three sites, only 50 species were common to all these sites. The results of the alpha and beta diversity analyses revealed significant floristic variability both within and across the KZNSS sites sampled, with Shannon's exponential index being highest in SSNR, followed by GGEP and lowest in IM. The lack of controlled access and unregulated burning regimes appear to have clearly affected the flora at the IM site in terms of species richness and increased evenness, as well as the relatively greater presence of introduced alien species and lower abundances of taxa of conservation concern. The pristine GGEP site had the highest number of species in total, with species being less evenly spread across the site, as well as the highest number of taxa conservation and low abundances of alien species. The main separations in the ordination results can be attributed to quadrat sampling performed pre-and post-burn. Conclusion: The floristic distinction of IM from GGEP and SSNR is attributed here to the intermediate disturbance effect of fire in grasslands which can lead to species loss if burning is too frequent. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of the delimitation, classification and management of KZNSS.

Does the exclusion of meiofauna affect the estimation of biotic indices using stream invertebrates?								AFRICAN ZOOLOGY				51	2			91	97		10.1080/15627020.2016.1196120			2016	2016	Biomonitoring of rivers is usually undertaken using information based on macroinvertebrate assemblages. However, exclusion of meiofauna (i.e. invertebrates less than 0.5 mm in size) when sorting benthic invertebrates can affect the estimation of densities and other biotic indices. In the present study, the effect of excluding the less than 0.5 mm fraction of invertebrates on estimation of benthic invertebrate indices was investigated in the Naro Moru River, Kenya. The Shannon-Wiener diversity index, Pielou's evenness index, a multimetric index, Simpson's diversity index, Margalef's diversity index, mean invertebrate density, taxa richness, and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera (EPT) densities were determined. Only mean invertebrate and EPT densities differed significantly between the greater than 0.5 mm and total fractions. In conclusion, exclusion of meiofauna from invertebrate samples can affect the estimation of some stream invertebrate biotic indices.

The hypoxia that developed in a microtidal estuary following an extreme storm produced dramatic changes in the benthos								MARINE AND FRESHWATER RESEARCH				67	3			327	341		10.1071/MF14216			2016	2016	Runoff froman extreme stormon 22 March 2010 led, during the next 3 months, to the formation of a pronounced halocline and underlying hypoxia in the upper reaches of themicrotidal Swan-Canning Estuary. Benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled between January 2010 and October 2011 at five sites along 10 km of this region. By mid-April, the number of species, total density, Simpson's evenness index and taxonomic distinctness had declined markedly, crustaceans had disappeared and the densities of annelids and molluscs had declined slightly. These faunal attributes ( except Simpson's index) and species composition did not recover until after the end of the hypoxia. The survival of annelids and loss of crustaceans in this period reflects different sensitivities of these taxa to severe environmental stress. The results emphasise that microtidal estuaries with long residence times are highly vulnerable to the effects of environmental perturbations, particularly during warmer periods of the year.

Reconciling Harvest Intensity and Plant Diversity in Boreal Ecosystems: Does Intensification Influence Understory Plant Diversity?								ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				56	5			1091	1103		10.1007/s00267-015-0551-8			NOV 2015	2015	Overall demand for forest products in the boreal forest is increasing to supply growing bio-energy demands in addition to traditional forest products. As a result, there is a need to refine current forest policies to reconcile production and ecosystem function within the context of ecologically sustainable management. This study assessed understory plants' richness, evenness, and diversity in six harvested boreal black spruce-dominated stands situated on loam, sand, and peat site types 15 years after the application of four harvest treatments of increasing biomass removals. Treatments included uncut, stem-only harvest, full-tree harvest, and full-tree harvest + blading of O horizon. Following canopy removal, species richness and diversity (Shannon's and Simpson's indices) increased on all soil types. The more than doubling of slash loading on the stem-only treatment plots compared to the full-tree plots led to significantly lower species diversity on loam sites; however, the reverse was observed on peat sites where the slash provided warmer, drier microsites facilitating the establishment of a broader array of species. Preexisting ericaceous shrub and sphagnum components continued to dominate on the peat sites. Compositional shifts were most evident for the full-tree + bladed treatment on all soil types, with increases in herbaceous cover including ruderal species. The results suggest that the intensification of harvesting on plant diversity varies with soil type, and these differential results should be considered in the refinement of forest biomass-harvesting guidelines to ensure ecological sustainability and biodiversity conservation over a broad suite of soil types.

The objective of this study was to evaluate influences of continuous and alternate no-tillage on soil AM fungal species composition and soil P-supply parameters. Materials and methods: In June 2006, a long-term field experiment was established in a sandy loam soil under the rotation of summer maize (Zea mays L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Northern China, including conventional tillage (CT), no-tillage (NT) and alternate tillage (AT - tillage in the wheat season and no-tillage in the maize season). Top soil samples (0-15 cm) from four individual plots per treatment were collected before maize harvest on 18 September 2010. Soil AM fungal spores were isolated and identified, and the external mycelium length, soil alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and soil P content were also determined. Results and discussion: Thirty species of AM fungi within seven genera, Acaulospora, Claroideoglomus, Funneliformis, Glomus, Racocetra, Rhizophagus, and Scutellospora, were recovered. Some species sporulated differentially across the three treatments, and the lowest Jaccard index (J) of similarity in species composition was recorded between NT and CT (J = 0.767), but there were no significant differences in soil total P and available P contents, as well as in AM fungal spore density (SD), species richness (SR) and diversity indices, including Shannon-Wiener index (H'), Evenness (E) and Simpson's index (D). Compared with CT, NT rather than AT significantly increased (P<0.05) the external mycelium length, soil ALP activity, and soil organic C content. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated the vital role of NT in maintaining external hyphae growth and soil ALP activity rather than in promoting AM fungal species diversity and spore density, and suggested that 4-year continuous NT will not cause degradation in either AM fungal community or soil P-supply efficiency.

Culture dependent diversity and phylogeny of thermophilic bacilli from a natural hot spring reservoir in the Gir Forest, Gujarat (India)								MICROBIOLOGY				84	5			687	700		10.1134/S0026261715050124			SEP 2015	2015	The thermophilic bacteria, isolated from a natural hot spring reservoir, Tulsi Shyam (Gir Forest, Gujarat, India) were characterized and diversified using the conventional approaches; Gram reaction, cell morphology, growth patterns, biochemical properties and antibiotic sensitivity. The bacteria were Gram positive, rod shaped and catalase positive. Majority of them produced amylase, indicating their ecological and biotechnological significance. The bacteria were further categorized on the basis of the amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) patterns, generated by a tetracutter RE, HaeIII. As a polyphasic taxonomy approach, the isolates were clustered into 9 different groups, based on the conventional approaches and the ARDRA patterns. The further analysis was based on the 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The trend suggested that the phenotypic and phylogenetic diversity data considerably coincided. Overall, the part of Tulsi Shyam hot spring bacterial community represented by cultivated aerobic organotrophs can be clustered into 3 Genera, Anoxybacillus, Geobacillus/Aeribacillus and Bacillus. They can further be grouped into sub-clusters at the species level to establish phylogenetic and phenotypic relationship. Further, the diversity indices; Simpson's index, Dominance index and Shannon index indicated the species diversity, species richness and distribution evenness, respectively. A lower Simpson's index (0.1905) and higher Dominance index (0.8095) revealed significant bacterial diversity. While a higher Shannon index (2.987) suggested evenness in the bacterial distribution in different soil and water samples. The lower values of Berger-Parker Dominance index and Ginni coefficient supported the trends of the Shannon index. As the studied habitat was not earlier explored for the bacterial diversity, the findings would significantly add to the knowledge of the cultivation based microbial diversity.		[Kikani, B.

Associations between stream hydrogeomorphology and co-dependent mussel-fish assemblages: evidence from an Ohio, USA river system								AQUATIC CONSERVATION-MARINE AND FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS				25	4			555	568		10.1002/aqc.2539			AUG 2015	2015	Understanding linkages among fluvial geomorphology, habitat, and aquatic biota is critical for effective stream ecosystem conservation. However, composite effects of hydrogeomorphic adjustment and condition, which collectively represent channel stability, on freshwater mussel and stream fish assemblages remain unresolved. Associations between stream hydrogeomorphic characteristics (channel geometry, substrate composition, stream flow) and mussel and stream fish assemblages were explored at 20 study reaches characterized by riffle-pool interfaces (RPIs) in Ohio, USA. At a coarse resolution using categorical classifications of equilibrium (i.e.stable) vs. adjusting (i.e.unstable) RPIs, overall fish and darter density was greater at adjusting RPIs (P=0.048 and P=0.024, respectively). Conversely, fish species richness was 1.2x greater at equilibrium than adjusting RPIs (P=0.047). Analysis of quantitative hydrogeomorphic data collected with fine-resolution surveys showed that hydrogeomorphic parameters explained from 20% (darter assemblage evenness) to 55% (density of mussels known to use darters as hosts) of the variation observed in all assemblages. Drainage area was significant in most models with variable influence: R-2=0.10 for darter species richness to R-2=0.41 for Simpson's diversity index of mussels with darter hosts. Other important predictor variables included embeddedness, velocity, shear stress, roughness, channel dimensions, and sediment size. Whereas coarse-level fluvial geomorphic classifications may be meaningful for fish, they appear less so for mussels. Fine-resolution quantitative hydrogeomorphic variables provided substantially more information for both assemblages, although hydrogeomorphology-fish and hydrogeomorphology-mussel relationships were not consistent. Some of the strongest relationships related to mussels that use darters as hosts, suggesting that these species are particularly sensitive to hydrogeomorphic conditions. Collectively, these results indicate that fluvial geomorphic condition and characteristics can simultaneously influence co-dependent stream biota. Stream conservation and management plans that include explicit hydrogeomorphic surveys may appreciably benefit cohabitating freshwater fish and mussel assemblages.

The objective of this study was to compare the species composition and ecological function of soil arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi during the growth and rotation of crops under NT and CT. From late June 2009 to early June 2010, 32 topsoil (0-15 cm) samples from four individual plots per treatment (CT and NT) were collected at both the jointing and maturation stages of maize (Zea mays L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) from a long-term experimental field that was established in an Aquic Inceptisol in North China in June 2006. The AM fungal spores were isolated and identified and then used to calculate species diversity indices, including the Shannon- Wiener index (H'), Evenness (E), and Simpson's index (D). The root mycorrhizal colonization and soil alkaline phosphatase activity were also determined. A total of 34 species of AM fungi within nine genera were recorded. Compared with NT, CT negatively affected the soil AM fungal community at the maize sowing stage, leading to decreases in the average diversity indices (from 2.12, 0.79, and 0.82 to 1.79, 0.72, and 0.74 for H', E, and D, respectively), root mycorrhizal colonization (from 28% to 20%), soil alkaline phosphatase activity (from 0.24 to 0.19 mg/g/24 h) and available phosphorus concentration (from 17.4 to 10.5 mg/kg) at the maize jointing stage. However, reductions in diversity indices of H', E, and D were restored to 2.20, 0.81, and 0.84, respectively, at the maize maturation stage. CT should affect the community again at the wheat sowing stage; however, a similar restoration in the species diversity of AM fungi was completed before the wheat jointing stage, and the highest Jaccard index (0.800) for similarity in the species composition of soil AM fungi between CT and NT was recorded at the wheat maturation stage. Our results also demonstrated that NT resulted in the positive protection of the community structure of AM fungi and played an important role in maintaining their functionality especially for maize seedlings.

J	Cook, James E.								Structural effects on understory attributes in second-growth forests of northern Wisconsin, USA								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				347				188	199		10.1016/j.foreco.2015.03.027			JUL 1 2015	2015	I sampled the understory and associated structural features in forty-four second growth forests of north-central Wisconsin, USA, to assess the influence of forest structure on four understory attributes: cover, richness, composition and evenness (variant of Simpson's index). Eight structural features (overstory basal area and crown cover, percent conifer overstory, midstory basal area, shrub frequency, snag basal area, coarse woody debris volume, and maple seedling density) were measured. An additional derived variable, coefficient of variation (CV) for cover, was also tested. The objectives of the study were to determine the significance and impact (increase or decrease) of each structural feature on understory attributes. These were addressed with regression, canonical correspondence analysis, and two-sample tests. Ordination was used to assess differences in composition among forest types. The analyses indicated that structure had no effect on richness or cover, a modest influence on composition, and strong effect on evenness. An important revelation was the over-riding influence of understory structure, but a small role for the overstory. The severity and type(s) of historical disturbance interacted with species pools to strongly constrain richness in the early 20th century. Small changes related to succession have occurred since then. The amount of understory cover is still changing but appears to be succession-related. In contrast, more than 40% of the variation in evenness was explained by maple seedling density, and two interaction variables: maple density*shrub frequency and overstory*midstory basal area. Higher maple seedling density decreased evenness, probably by competitive effects. As the interaction variables increased, evenness was reduced. The regression analysis and CCA point to the shrub layer as having a direct, mechanistic effect on which species are present and their abundance; whereas the presence of shrubs is relatively benign. It is hypothesized that the abundance of upper strata resulted in varying levels of resource limitations, and influenced other environmental features to the extent that niche heterogeneity was affected. The proportion of conifer in the overstory had an important influence on understory composition, but hemlock assemblages did not differ from broadleaved forests in richness or cover. These results suggest that excess emphasis has been placed on the influence of the upper strata, but too little on the shrub and understory layers. Thus, the management of understory assemblages should carefully evaluate the sub-ordinate strata because they may be more important than upper layers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

When a key species is lost, there are important effects in the structure and diversity of the coexistent taxa. We analyzed the reef fish community in a period subsequent to the mass mortality event of the sea urchin Diadema mexicanum, reported in May 2009 in La Entrega, Huatulco, Mexico. Visual censuses were carried out monthly from August 2009 to July 2010 in order to record abundance and species richness. The data were used concurrently with data generated previously (February 2006-January 2007) in La Entrega using the same methodology in order to obtain community ecological Indices (Shannon's diversity, Pielou's evenness and Simpson's dominance). Significant differences in fish assemblages regarding the periods before and after the die-off were tested using MDS, PERMANOVA, and SIMPER. The results showed a significant increase of abundance of fishes after the event of mass mortality, compared to the period previous to the event. There were significant differences in fish assemblages between periods. The dissimilarity between the periods was explained by the presence of Haemulon maculicauda (28.96%), Thalssoma lucasanum (22.17%), Selar crumenophthalmus (12.93%) and Stegastes acapulcoensis (11.44%). Our results suggest that the disturbance produced by the disappearance of D. mexicanum had important effects on the icthic community with feeding habits similar to those of the urchin, affecting more importantly to S. acapulcoensis and in less intensity to other herbivores such as Scarus gobban and Prionurus punctatus; meanwhile other fishes which are carnivores (for instance H. maculicauda) also increased importantly in abundance, suggesting that the disappearance of the urchin and in consequence its competitive effect, probably also propitiated a significant increase of other invertebrates which constitute the food source for carnivores.

The present study, through a rapid quantitative assessment of regional flora along Kukush Lake in Langar-Shandoor Valley, provides a better scientific understanding of diversity and distribution of alpine vegetation. Vegetation data were collected from eight sites using stratified random sampling. A total of 51 species (28 plant families) were recorded with an average species richness in the area of 2.14; Simpson's diversity, 0.75; evenness, 0.79 and average degree of community maturity index of 44%. Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA), regression analyses and factor analyses were used to identify vegetation associations. DCA clearly separated the associations along the first two axes. Altitude and moisture contents appeared to be key environmental factors governing the diversity and distribution of alpine vegetation. A negative correlation of altitude with diversity and richness was revealed. Vegetation exhibited significant variations in the diversity and distribution along the sampled sites. These variations may be attributed to the prevalent anthropogenic and livestock disturbances. The implications of the results have been discussed to highlight the conservation needs for protection of endemic floral elements in HMI alpine region.

Forty AM species belonging to ten genera viz. Acaulospora, Claroideoglomus, Dentiscutata, Diversispora, Funneliformis, Gigaspora, Glomus, Redeckera, Scutellospora and Septoglomus were recorded indicating high level of AM richness in coconut rhizosphere. Of these, eighteen AM fungal species are being reported for first time from this palm. Claroideoglomus, Glomus and Gigaspora were the most commonly present genera and Claroideoglomus etunicatum and Glomus aggregatum the common species. The diversity indices (Shannon indices values) of AM fungi associated with coconut palm in a crop mixed system and mono crop varied significantly. The Shannon index, Simpson's index and evenness ranged from 1.40 +/- 0.10 to 2.70 +/- 0.01, 0.65 +/- 0.033 to 0.90 +/- 0.004, 0.51 +/- 0.01 to 0.82 +/- 0.01, respectively. Correlation between soil physio chemical characters and mycorrhizal parameters were worked out. Soil pH had negative correlation with spore count, root colonization, species richness, Shannon H and Simpson indices but had positive correlation with species evenness. Electrical conductivity showed positive correlation with root mycorrhizal colonization which indicated active AMF mediated uptake of nutrients.		[Rajeshkumar, P.

ARCHIVES OF AGRONOMY AND SOIL SCIENCE				61	2			173	184		10.1080/03650340.2014.928927			FEB 1 2015	2015	To enhance soil management of Malus hupehensis orchards, we investigated the effects of maize residue (MR) and cellulose-decomposing bacteria on soil microbial properties, soil organic fractions, and growth of 1-year-old potted M. hupehensis Rehd. seedlings. Potted soil was treated with MR, microbial inocula (MI) of Bacillus cereus (MI), MR+MI, and untreated (CK), and collected after 30, 60, and 90 d. The results showed that MR increased microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and MI reduced MBC. The results of Biolog Eco-Plate (TM) showed that soil microbial functional diversity with MR+MI was significantly higher at 30 d and significantly lower at 60 d compared to MR. Shannon index, substrate richness, substrate evenness, and Simpson's dominance showed that MR and MI increased the microbial functional diversity after 30 and 90 d. MR+MI significantly increased humic acids (HAs); however, MR or MI alone only slightly affected HAs. Combined application of MR and MI had a synergistic effect on the content and composition of soil organic matter and plant growth than either treatment alone.

A total of 781 individuals of fish representing 25 species, belonging to five families were caught during the study period. The fish fauna in the river was dominated by species belonging to the family Cyprinidae (49.93%) followed by Nemacheilidae (27.52%). Families Channidae, Sisoridae and Mastacembelidae constituted 10.88%, 10.37% and 1.28% respectively. Most dominant species were Crossocheilusdiplocheilus(15.492%) followed by Garragotyla (15.1%) and Cyprinuscarpio (8.194%). These species were abundant especially during the months of May and July. Ctenopharyngodonidella (Family: Cyprinidae), Triplophysamicrops (Family: Nemacheilidae) andSchisturamacrolepis (Family: Nemacheilidae) were the least existing species with 0.128%, 0.512% and 1.152% abundance respectively. Physico-chemical parameters of water were also monitored, mean values of which were as follows; temperature (21.275 degrees C), pH (7.325), dissolved Oxygen (8.975mg/L), electric conductivity (201.675 mu s/cm), total dissolved solid (127.912 mg/L), total suspended solid (129.857 mg/L), total hardness (118.75mg/l), free CO2(4.3 mg/L), turbidity (1.34NTU), salinity (0.0075 mg/L), Ca hardness (77.5mg/L), Mg hardness(43.25mg/L), Sodium(5.1mg/L), Potassium(2.825mg/L), total alkalinity (98mg/L), Chloride (15.93mg/L) and nitrates (0.035mg/L). Over all Simpson's diversity value (1-D= 0.92031) and Simpson's Reciprocal index value (1/D= 12.54936) indicates that River Panjkora is quite diverse concerning fish species richness and evenness.

J	Stephenson, Christy McNey; Hallock, Pamela; Kelmo, Francisco								Foraminiferal assemblage indices: A comparison of sediment and reef rubble samples from Conch Reef, Florida, USA								ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				48				1	7		10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.07.004			JAN 2015	2015	Benthic foraminiferal assemblages are increasingly utilized as indicators of water and sediment quality in coastal-marine environments. Most reef-dwelling foraminifers live on firm substrata such as reef or phytal surfaces, while most assessments have examined assemblages from sediments. This case study compared relative abundances of total foraminiferal-shell assemblages between sediment and phytal/rubble samples collected from one reef within one week. A total of 117 species within 72 genera were identified, with the same taxa in both sample sets in different proportions. Larger benthic foraminifers and some agglutinated taxa were concentrated about 1.5-3 fold in sediment samples, while nearly two-thirds of small, fragile shells were lost. Several common indices were compared, including Taxonomic Richness (number of genera), Shannon (H), Simpson's (D) and Fisher (a) diversity indices, Evenness (E), and the FORAM Index (FI). Highly significant differences (p<0.001) between shell assemblages from 13 sets of phytal/rubble substrata and sediments were found in mean number ( standard deviation) of genera (49 +/- 4 vs. 34 +/- 10) and mean FI (5.6 +/- 0.8 vs. 3.6 +/- 0.4); both reflecting greater relative abundances of smaller foraminifers in the rubble samples. Fisher diversity was marginally significant (p = 0.05); other indices showed no significant differences between sample types. Although assessment of total assemblages is substantially less costly than distinguishing between specimens that were live or dead when collected, many researchers report those distinctions. The results of our study provide insight that can assist interpretations of studies that use live assemblages to calculate the Fl, rather than total assemblages for which it was originally developed.

Effects of residual hydrocarbons on the reed community after 10 years of oil extraction and the effectiveness of different biological indicators for the long-term risk assessments								ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				48				235	243		10.1016/j.ecolind.2014.08.017			JAN 2015	2015	The selection of certain indicators is critical to undertake ecological risk assessments of long-term oil pollution and other environmental changes. The indicators should be easily and routinely monitored, be sensitive to pollution, respond to pollution in a predictable manner, and match the spatial and temporal scales of investigations. To compare the effectiveness of indicators for the long-term risk assessments, this study investigated the multiple ecological effects of chronic oil pollution on the plant community dominated by reed (Phragmites australis). The physiology, growth and reproduction of reed, together with the composition and productivity of the reed community, were measured around oil wells that have operated for approximately 10 years in the Yellow River Delta, eastern China. The predictive power of each indicator was evaluated using the coefficients of determination (R-2) of linear regression models established for each indicator and soil Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons (TPH) concentration. The sensitivities of indicators were evaluated by comparing slopes of new established regression lines using standardized data. The top three indicators in terms of predictive power were leaf length, width and number, followed by the Shannon Wiener index, Pielou evenness index and Simpson's diversity index. Community aboveground biomass, foliar projective coverage and species richness showed predictive power lower than those of the three diversity indexes, but higher than those of leaf net photosynthetic rate, reed height, aboveground biomass and vertical projective coverage of reed plants. Leaf transpiration, chlorophyll concentration and reed stem density showed no significant linear response to elevated soil TPH concentration. In terms of sensitivity, the top three biological indicators were Pielou evenness index, Simpson's diversity index and Shannon Wiener index, followed by community vertical projective coverage, community aboveground biomass, and species richness. Leaf number, length and width were moderately sensitive, followed by reed coverage, aboveground biomass and height. The sensitivity of net photosynthetic rate was the lowest. The predictive power and sensitivities of indicators were compared in terms of their spatial and temporal scales. In conclusion, scale can be used to facilitate the selection of indicators, and the combination of different indicators may yield improved understanding of the various effects of elevated soil TPH concentration at the different biological levels.

However, whether Bt corn exerts undesirable effects on non-target arthropods (NTAs) is still controversial. We conducted a 2-yr study in Shangzhuang Agricultural Experiment Station to assess the potential impact of Bt corn on field population density, biodiversity, community composition and structure of NTAs. On each sampling date, the total abundance, Shannon's diversity index, Pielou's evenness index and Simpson's diversity index were not significantly affected by Bt corn as compared to non-Bt corn. The "sampling dates'' had a significant effect on these indices, but no clear tendencies related to "Bt corn'' or "sampling dates X corn variety'' interaction were recorded. Principal response curve analysis of variance indicated that Bt corn did not alter the distribution of NTAs communities. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity and distance analysis showed that Cry1Ac toxin exposure did not increase community dissimilarities between Bt and non-Bt corn plots and that the evolution of non-target arthropod community was similar on the two corn varieties. The cultivation of Bt corn failed to show any detrimental evidence on the density of non-target herbivores, predators and parasitoids. The composition of herbivores, predators and parasitoids was identical in Bt and non-Bt corn plots. Taken together, results from the present work support that Bt corn producing Cry1Ac toxins does not adversely affect NTAs.

Plant defence inducers rapidly influence the diversity of bacterial communities in a potting mix								APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY				84				1	5		10.1016/j.apsoil.2014.06.011			DEC 2014	2014	Plant hormones and their functional analogues are used in agriculture to combat plant diseases and pests. These chemicals are generally targeted at shoots, but soils inevitably receive a dose during application. In this study, we used 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing to determine whether the diversity of bacterial communities in a potting mix (referred here as 'model soil') is influenced by exposure to salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), ethylene (ET) and abscisic acid (ABA). The number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs; richness) and Simpson's Diversity Index values (evenness) associated with each sample was not influenced by the hormone treatments, but changes in community composition were observed. Relative to the control, all hormones more than doubled the abundance of a Limnobacter population, ABA led to a four-fold increase in a Cellvibrio population, ET led to a c. 70% decrease in an Algoriphagus population, and MeJA and ABA applications halved the abundance of a Massilia population. These changes may influence plant productivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Choosing and using diversity indices: insights for ecological applications from the German Biodiversity Exploratories								ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION				4	18			3514	3524		10.1002/ece3.1155			SEP 2014	2014	Biodiversity, a multidimensional property of natural systems, is difficult to quantify partly because of the multitude of indices proposed for this purpose. Indices aim to describe general properties of communities that allow us to compare different regions, taxa, and trophic levels. Therefore, they are of fundamental importance for environmental monitoring and conservation, although there is no consensus about which indices are more appropriate and informative. We tested several common diversity indices in a range of simple to complex statistical analyses in order to determine whether some were better suited for certain analyses than others. We used data collected around the focal plant Plantago lanceolata on 60 temperate grassland plots embedded in an agricultural landscape to explore relationships between the common diversity indices of species richness (S), Shannon's diversity (H'), Simpson's diversity (D-1), Simpson's dominance (D-2), Simpson's evenness (E), and Berger-Parker dominance (BP). We calculated each of these indices for herbaceous plants, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aboveground arthropods, belowground insect larvae, and P.lanceolata molecular and chemical diversity. Including these trait-based measures of diversity allowed us to test whether or not they behaved similarly to the better studied species diversity. We used path analysis to determine whether compound indices detected more relationships between diversities of different organisms and traits than more basic indices. In the path models, more paths were significant when using H', even though all models except that with E were equally reliable. This demonstrates that while common diversity indices may appear interchangeable in simple analyses, when considering complex interactions, the choice of index can profoundly alter the interpretation of results. Data mining in order to identify the index producing the most significant results should be avoided, but simultaneously considering analyses using multiple indices can provide greater insight into the interactions in a system.

Methods: A study area was selected in a traditionally managed mountain woody pasture during July 2012 to June 2013. The area was sampled by quadrat method. The quadrats were laid down at regular intervals of 150 m. The size of quadrats was kept 10x10, 5X5 and 1x1 m(2) for trees, shrubs and herbs respectively. Density, frequency and cover were recorded. Importance value index of each plant species was calculated and plant communities were named after the plant species having the highest IV. Then diversity, its components and regenerating capacity were calculated with their formulas. Results: Shannon's diversity ranged from 2.75 to 3.31, Simpson's diversity, 0.90 to 0.95; Menhinick's diversity, 0.83 to 1.19; evenness, 0.41 to 0.65; species richness, 4.89 to 6.08 and maturity index, 30 to 44 species distribution pattern. Diversity values were similar to the other Himalayan forests. Pinus roxburghaii was the only regenerating species whereas the remaining four tree species including Qurecus dilatata regenerate up to 100 cm; they are at extreme risk of elimination due to anthropogenic factors. Conclusions: Nikyal valley is under severe deforestation pressure for fuel and timber value. There is an urgent need to promote the ethics among the people that improvement and conservation of natural resources are critical for land and soil management.

Factors affecting the stability of arthropod community in turn influence the relationship between arthropod diversity and stability, which has been rarely investigated. We conducted a 2-year field-experiment in Shanghai and Jiangsu province in eastern China, examining the effects of the ecological engineering of ground cover plant Trifolium repens on the diversity and stability of canopy arthropod community in peach orchards. The results indicated that five diversity indices (abundance, species richness, Simpson's index, Shannon-Wiener index and Pielou's evenness index) and four stability indices (N-n/N-p,S-n/S-p,(N-n + N-d)/N-p and (S-n, + S-d)/S-p) were all significantly higher but the coefficient of variation (d(s)/d(m)) was significantly lower in ground cover areas than control areas. The results of Pearson's correlations were significantly negative for abundance/richness and the above four stability indices both in ground cover areas and control ones in both sites; correlations between Pielou evenness index and the above four stability indices were all positive in control areas, while those in ground cover areas were not the same. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding for arthropod community stability, suggesting that regulating harmful arthropods by beneficial and neutral arthropods was the basic implication of arthropod stability, and demonstrates that the ecological engineering of ground cover T. repens can enhance the diversity and stability of canopy arthropod communities but increased arthropod diversity will not always positively affect arthropod stability.

Furthermore, little is known about how climate and local site conditions affect species evenness and understorey plant diversity. Location Canadian forest (42 degrees 37' to 68 degrees 14' N; 53 degrees 25' to 134 degrees 46' W; 4 to 2170 m elevation). Methods Using national, broad-scale forest inventory data, we tested the influence of growing degree days (GDD), climate moisture index (CMI), soil drainage class (SDC) and stand age (SA) on plant diversity across Canada's forests. Diversity was assessed on variable plot sizes from 125 to 500 m(2) for canopy tree and total plant species, and from 100 to 400 m(2) for understorey plants. Results Our models accounted for 47, 30 and 49% of total variation in canopy tree species richness, Simpson's dominance index and total plant species richness, respectively. After accounting for the effects of plot size and management history, canopy richness increased with GDD and CMI and peaked at intermediate SDC and SA. Simpson's dominance index decreased with increasing GDD and CMI and was lowest at intermediate SDC and SA. Total species richness was most strongly related to SDC and was highest on imperfectly drained soils. Climatic controls on species richness of understorey strata were generally weaker than those on canopy richness. Main conclusions Our results for canopy richness along a mainly longitudinal gradient demonstrate the positive effects of energy on tree species diversity and show evidence for the effects of local site conditions and secondary succession on diversity. Furthermore, our results show that the extent of the influence of climate and local site conditions on plant species diversity can strongly differ between vegetation strata.		[Zhang, Yu; Chen, Han Y.

J	Wan, Nian-Feng; Ji, Xiang-Yun; Jiang, Jie-Xian								Testing the Enemies Hypothesis in Peach Orchards in Two Different Geographic Areas in Eastern China: The Role of Ground Cover Vegetation								PLOS ONE				9	6					e99850	10.1371/journal.pone.0099850			JUN 25 2014	2014	Many studies have supported the enemies hypothesis, which suggests that natural enemies are more efficient at controlling arthropod pests in polyculture than in monoculture agro-ecosystems. However, we do not yet have evidence as to whether this hypothesis holds true in peach orchards over several geographic locations. In the two different geographic areas in eastern China (Xinchang a town in the Shanghai municipality, and Hudai, a town in Jiangsu Province) during a continuous three-year (2010-2012) investigation, we sampled arthropod pests and predators in Trifolium repens L. and in tree canopies of peach orchards with and without the ground cover plant T. repens. No significant differences were found in the abundances of the main groups of arthropod pests and predators in T. repens between Hudai and Xinchang. The abundance, richness, Simpson's index, Shannon-Wiener index, and Pielou evenness index of canopy predators in ground cover areas increased by 85.5, 27.5, 3.5, 16.7, and 7.9% in Xinchang, and by 87.0, 27.6, 3.5, 17.0 and 8.0% in Hudai compared to those in the controls, respectively. The average abundance of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Homoptera, true bugs and Acarina canopy pests in ground cover areas decreased by 9.2, 10.2, 17.2, 19.5 and 14.1% in Xinchang, and decreased by 9.5, 8.2, 16.8, 20.1 and 16.6% in Hudai compared to that in control areas, respectively. Our study also found a higher density of arthropod species resources in T. repens, as some omnivorous pests and predators residing in T. repens could move between the ground cover and the orchard canopy. In conclusion, ground cover in peach orchards supported the enemies hypothesis, as indicated by the fact that ground cover T. repens promoted the abundance and diversity of predators and reduced the number of arthropod pests in tree canopies in both geographical areas.

J	Wu, Jirong; Yu, Mingzheng; Xu, Jianhong; Du, Juan; Ji, Fang; Dong, Fei; Li, Xinhai; Shi, Jianrong								Impact of Transgenic Wheat with <i>wheat yellow mosaic virus</i> Resistance on Microbial Community Diversity and Enzyme Activity in Rhizosphere Soil								PLOS ONE				9	6					e98394	10.1371/journal.pone.0098394			JUN 4 2014	2014	The transgenic wheat line N12-1 containing the WYMV-Nib8 gene was obtained previously through particle bombardment, and it can effectively control the wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) disease transmitted by Polymyxa graminis at turngreen stage. Due to insertion of an exogenous gene, the transcriptome of wheat may be altered and affect root exudates. Thus, it is important to investigate the potential environmental risk of transgenic wheat before commercial release because of potential undesirable ecological side effects. Our 2-year study at two different experimental locations was performed to analyze the impact of transgenic wheat N12-1 on bacterial and fungal community diversity in rhizosphere soil using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) at four growth stages (seeding stage, turngreen stage, grain-filling stage, and maturing stage). We also explored the activities of urease, sucrase and dehydrogenase in rhizosphere soil. The results showed that there was little difference in bacterial and fungal community diversity in rhizosphere soil between N12-1 and its recipient Y158 by comparing Shannon's, Simpson's diversity index and evenness (except at one or two growth stages). Regarding enzyme activity, only one significant difference was found during the maturing stage at Xinxiang in 2011 for dehydrogenase. Significant growth stage variation was observed during 2 years at two experimental locations for both soil microbial community diversity and enzyme activity. Analysis of bands from the gel for fungal community diversity showed that the majority of fungi were uncultured. The results of this study suggested that virus-resistant transgenic wheat had no adverse impact on microbial community diversity and enzyme activity in rhizosphere soil during 2 continuous years at two different experimental locations. This study provides a theoretical basis for environmental impact monitoring of transgenic wheat when the introduced gene is derived from a virus.

J	Jones, Andrew D.; Shrinivas, Aditya; Bezner-Kerr, Rachel								Farm production diversity is associated with greater household dietary diversity in Malawi: Findings from nationally representative data								FOOD POLICY				46				1	12		10.1016/j.foodpol.2014.02.001			JUN 2014	2014	Farm production diversity has the potential to influence the diversity of household diets, an important nutrition outcome associated with the nutrient adequacy of diets and the nutritional status of individuals. Yet, little empirical research has assessed the relationship between farm diversity and diet diversity or the plausible causal mechanisms that may operate between these two constructs. This research examines cross-sectional data from the Malawi Third Integrated Household Survey (IHS3), a nationally representative sample of farming households in Malawi, implemented from March 2010 March 2011 as part of the World Bank Living Standards Measurement Study Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA). These data were used to determine the relationship between farm production diversity and household dietary diversity, and to identify determinants of this relationship. Two indicators of dietary diversity, a modified Household Dietary Diversity Score (HDDS), and the Food Consumption Score (FCS), were calculated along with three indicators of farm production diversity including the Simpson's Index, a metric accounting for both species richness and evenness. In multiple regression analyses, adjusting standard errors for the complex survey design of the IHS3 and controlling for the effects of several covariates on household dietary diversity, farm production diversity was consistently positively associated with dietary diversity (P < 0.0001). The association of increased farm diversity as measured by a combined crop and livestock measure on dietary diversity was significantly greater in woman-headed households compared to those headed by men (HDDS: P = 0.008; FCS: P = 0.076). The positive association of farm diversity with dietary diversity was also greater in wealthier households (P < 0.05). Consumption of legumes, vegetables and fruits was especially strongly associated with greater farm diversity. More diverse production systems may contribute to more diverse household diets. However, this relationship is complex; it may be influenced by gender, wealth, control of household decisions, the relative market-orientation of a household's agricultural production, and the specific nature of farm diversity.

Distribution of <i>Burkholderia pseudomallei</i> in Northern Australia, a Land of Diversity								APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY				80	11			3463	3468		10.1128/AEM.00128-14			JUN 2014	2014	Burkholderia pseudomallei is a Gram-negative soil bacillus that is the etiological agent of melioidosis and a biothreat agent. Little is known about the biogeography of this bacterium in Australia, despite its hyperendemicity in the northern region of this continent. The population structure of 953 Australian B. pseudomallei strains representing 779 and 174 isolates of clinical and environmental origins, respectively, was analyzed using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Bayesian population structure and network SplitsTree analyses were performed on concatenated MLST loci, and sequence type (ST) diversity and evenness were examined using Simpson's and Pielou's indices and a multivariate dissimilarity matrix. Bayesian analysis found two B. pseudomallei populations in Australia that were geographically distinct; isolates from the Northern Territory were grouped mainly into the first population, whereas the majority of isolates from Queensland were grouped in a second population. Differences in ST evenness were observed between sampling areas, confirming that B. pseudomallei is widespread and established across northern Australia, with a large number of fragmented habitats. ST analysis showed that B. pseudomallei populations diversified as the sampling area increased. This observation was in contrast to smaller sampling areas where a few STs predominated, suggesting that B. pseudomallei populations are ecologically established and not frequently dispersed. Interestingly, there was no identifiable ST bias between clinical and environmental isolates, suggesting the potential for all culturable B. pseudomallei isolates to cause disease. Our findings have important implications for understanding the ecology of B. pseudomallei in Australia and for potential source attribution of this bacterium in the event of unexpected cases of melioidosis.

Sequence independent techniques like single strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) was attempted in the present study to resolve AOB using ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) and hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (hao) gene fragments, unique to AOB. Variation in hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (HAO) enzyme zymogram of isolates observed in the study was also explored as an additional sequence independent method to substantiate the observations. Nitrosomonas europaea (standard strain) and 12 isolates, obtained by enriching environmental samples, were differentiated into six and four groups by SSCP analyses of amoA and hao gene fragments, respectively, whereas they could be resolved into six distinct groups through activity staining of HAO enzyme. amoA gene fragment was therefore found to be better than hao gene fragment in resolving the studied AOB based on richness and evenness with Simpson's index of diversity - 0.85. However, the ensembled use of these molecular methods (SSCP of amoA and hao gene fragments) and HAO enzyme zymogram in fingerprinting AOB provide better resolution and evenness, contributing significantly in AOB diversity studies. Grouping of AOB isolates by hao gene SSCP analysis followed almost the same pattern as that by 16S rRNA gene based sequence analysis, hence it is suitable as a phylogenetic marker.

J	Johnsen, Anders R.; Styrishave, Bjarne; Aamand, Jens								Quantification of small-scale variation in the size and composition of phenanthrene-degrader populations and PAH contaminants in traffic-impacted topsoil								FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY				88	1			84	93		10.1111/1574-6941.12272			APR 2014	2014	Small-scale colocalisation of microbial polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) degraders and PAHs in contaminated soil is a prerequisite for efficient biodegradation of the PAHs. We therefore tested the hypothesis that phenanthrene-degrading bacteria are colocalised with PAHs at the millimetre-to-centimetre-scale. Microbial populations and PAH concentrations were determined for 40-mg samples from a 112-mm transect of a traffic-impacted topsoil. The spatial distribution of cultivable phenanthrene degraders (0.3x10(5)-7.2x10(5)cellsg(-1)) mirrored neither the distribution of PAHs, nor the distribution of the total cultivable heterotrophic populations. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of PAH dioxygenase genes (2x10(6)-4x10(6)cellsg(-1)) from a second transect showed distributions similar to the cultivable phenanthrene degraders, but at a 20-fold higher level. The omnipresence of high densities of PAH degraders at the millimetre scale indicate that PAH persistence may not be caused by local lack of degrader cells. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that either MPN of pollutant degraders, qPCR of functional genes, CFU of heterotrophic micro-organisms, or the content of PAHs have been determined with such high spatial resolution.

J	Feest, Alan; van Swaay, Chris; van Hinsberg, Arjen								Nitrogen deposition and the reduction of butterfly biodiversity quality in the Netherlands								ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				39				115	119		10.1016/j.ecolind.2013.12.008			APR 2014	2014	Butterfly decline in Northern Europe is a cause of concern and it has been hypothesised that this is due to nitrogen deposition inducing excess early growth of plants. It has also been changing the quality of the food available to larvae. We tested these hypotheses by linking butterfly biodiversity quality indices (species richness, population, biomass, conservation value, evenness (Simpson's Index) and modelled species richness (Chao 1 and 2)) with nitrogen Critical Load Exceedence (nCLE) data. An index of butterfly sensitivity to nitrogen was also created (Species Nitrogen Value Index (SNVI)). Using PCA, datasets were tested for associations and relationships. The results included multiple biodiversity quality indices based on 17 years of data (aggregated into three periods of six, six and five years to give 287 datasets) in four habitat types (grassland, heathland, woodland and farmland). With the exception of heathland the analysis showed that nitrogen deposition and all other indices (except SNVI) were in decline. For heathland the last 11 years did not show any significant decline. Heathland also showed an anomalous biodiversity quality profile for these last 11 years, suggesting that the sensitivity of heathland to nitrogen deposition will require further considerable efforts to achieve a nitrogen deposition that is not in exceedence of the critical load. Habitat restoration will take time due to the multiple hindrances to colonisation, which in the case of heathland might prevent successful butterfly colonisation for the foreseeable future. These results indicate the efficacy of butterfly biodiversity quality and nCLE as indicators for the SEBI 2020 process (Streamlining European Biodiversity Indicators) by showing the relationship between them.

J	Su, Shiliang; Xiao, Rui; Li, Delong; Hu, Yi'na								Impacts of Transportation Routes on Landscape Diversity: A Comparison of Different Route Types and Their Combined Effects								ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT				53	3			636	647		10.1007/s00267-013-0214-6			MAR 2014	2014	A comparison of different transportation route types and their combined effects on landscape diversity was conducted within Tiaoxi watershed (China) between 1994 and 2005. Buffer analysis and Mann-Kendall's test were used to quantify the relationships between distance from transportation routes (railway, highway, national, and provincial road) and a family of landscape diversity parameters (Simpson's diversity index, Simpson's evenness index, Shannon's diversity index, and Shannon's evenness index). One-way ANOVA was further applied to compare influences from different route types and their combined effects. Five other landscape metrics (patch density, edge density, area-weighted mean shape index, connectance index, and Euclidean nearest neighbor distance) were also calculated to analyze the associations between landscape diversity and landscape pattern characteristics. Results showed that transportation routes exerted significant impacts on landscape diversity. Impact from railway was comparable to that from highway and national road but was more significant than that from provincial road. The spatial influential range of railway and national road was wider than that of highway and provincial road. Combined effects of routes were nonlinear, and impacts from different route types were more complex than those from the same type. The four landscape diversity metrics were comparably effective at the buffer zone scale. In addition, landscape diversity can be alternatively used to indicate fragmentation, connectivity, and isolation at route buffer scale. This study demonstrates an applicable approach to quantitatively characterize the impacts from transportation routes on landscape patterns and has potential to facilitate route network planning.

The bacteria were isolated by nutrient agar and nutrient broth from waste water and sludge collected from the sewage outfall of a pharmaceutical factory. The bacteria were identified by Gram staining and biochemical tests, and the bacterial community diversity was analyzed by Shannon-Wiener diversity index (H), Pielou evenness index (J) and Simpson's diversity index (D). The occurrence of qnrA and integrons (intI1, intI2) were detected by Real-time PCR assays. The results showed that 90 strains were isolated from water samples and sludge samples including 22 genera and 26 species. Types of bacteria in water samples contained 18 genera and 20 species, while 13 genera and 14 species were detected in sludge samples. Fifty-five Enterobacteriaceae isolates (61.11 %, 55 of 90) were the predominant bacteria in water and sludge samples. Bacterial species richness and evenness in water samples were higher than in sludge samples. The resistance genes of qnrA and integrons (intI1, intI2) with the total DNA and single isolate plasmid DNA were detected. There were a variety of bacterial species and the presence of qnrA and integrons (intI1, intI2) genes in pharmaceutical wastewater habitats, in which Enterobacteriaceae strains were the dominant bacteria. These results suggested that pharmaceutical wastewater had potential risks to public health.

Rarefaction and extrapolation with Hill numbers: a framework for sampling and estimation in species diversity studies								ECOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS				84	1			45	67		10.1890/13-0133.1			FEB 2014	2014	Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number D-q, where q = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number D-q, q > 0) and present a unified approach for both individual-based (abundance) data and sample-based (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers: q = 0 (species richness), q = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and q = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short-range extrapolation. For long-range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of q and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.		[Chao, Anne; Hsieh, T. C.; Ma, K.

J	Feld, Christian K.; de Bello, Francesco; Doledec, Sylvain								Biodiversity of traits and species both show weak responses to hydromorphological alteration in lowland river macroinvertebrates								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				59	2			233	248		10.1111/fwb.12260			FEB 2014	2014	1. Lotic ecosystems worldwide are being increasingly modified hydromorphologically, for example, by damming, fragmentation, flow regulation and channel modification. Serious threats to riverine biodiversity are suspected, yet available field data are few and rarely address the various taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic components of biodiversity. 2. We examined benthic macroinvertebrate diversity along a gradient of hydromorphological alteration across 65 lowland river sites in the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. We calculated eight metrics describing taxonomic diversity (richness, rarefied richness, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity, Pielou's evenness), functional diversity (mean trait diversity) and phylogenetic diversity (mean taxonomic distinctness and its variance). 3. Threshold Indicator Taxa ANalysis (TITAN) and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMS) showed detailed changes in taxonomic and trait composition, respectively, with increasing hydromorphological alteration. TITAN revealed a gradual turnover under increasing impact in which taxon losses were almost balanced by gains. NMS illustrated a high degree of concordance in the traits possessed by the taxa lost and gained at the gradient's end points. 4. Although a biologically meaningful hydromorphological gradient was evident, the biodiversity response was modest (Spearman's <|0.32| for all metrics). Pielou's evenness and mean taxonomic distinctness actually increased at impaired sites. 5. Our results suggest that taxonomic and trait replacement with hydromorphological alteration is not followed by changes in whole-community diversity. This implies some redundancy in these systems, with ecologically similar species replacing those lost through environmental change. 6. The results highlight how whole-community-based diversity, although frequently calculated and interpreted for decades in ecology and conservation biology, is not the all-purpose concept to detect and assess the various facets of biodiversity loss. Therefore, we suggest that concerted effort is needed to develop and test novel indicators of biodiversity, capable of detecting biodiversity loss, or other changes, in response to the main environmental stressors of lotic ecosystems.

Various composition and configuration metrics were used to analyze characteristics of land cover and its spatial heterogeneity. Satellite images (i.e., SPOT) were used to classify land cover. Pattern analyses were conducted in Erdemli district of Mersin, Turkey, from coastline to about 200m ASL. Landscape patterns were quantified and mapped on the basis of number of patches (NP), edge density (ED), largest patch index (LPI), aggregation index (AI), Shannon's and Simpson's diversity and evenness indices (SHDI, SIDI, SHEI, STET). A relationship between observed patterns/calculated indices and current land uses were investigated. Results showed that many of the pattern features differed between the coast and upper lands due to varying composition and configuration characteristics of land cover types under investigation.

The subtropical atlantic Araucaria forest, typical on the southern Brazil, in some regions has been reduced to less than 1% of its original size lasting only in small isolated fragments. This study aimed to analyse the impact the edge has on vascular epiphyte ensemble in a remnant of Araucaria forest. We surveyed 40 host trees in four transects: one at the edge; and three at 15, 30 and 60 m from the edge. On each host tree we estimated the epiphyte biomass, using four size classes. We compared the transects using Jackknife estimator of absolute species number, diversity indices, non-metric multi-dimensional scaling and multi-response permutation procedure analysis. We recorded 85 epiphytes species. Absolute species richness and diversity were lower at the edge and higher at 60 m in from the edge. Shannon's evenness did not differ significantly among transects and Simpson's evenness values were inconsistent. The vascular epiphyte community under study was significantly altered by the edge.

Bleaching: The Driving Force of Scleractinian New Recruitment at Little Andaman Island, Andaman and Nicobar Islands								PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES INDIA SECTION B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				83	4			585	592		10.1007/s40011-013-0168-8			DEC 2013	2013	Peak bleaching of corals was seen in 2010 in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The results were observed as adverse impacts on the reef environment. Little Andaman Island is the southern-most part of Andaman group of Islands. The continental shelf of this island showed a limited number of scleractinian corals as new recruitment at the destroyed reef areas after the 2004 tsunami. Only 34 species of hermatypic corals were reported in 2009. Consecutive underwater survey and experimental outcome reveals that 124 species of scleractinian corals were identified from the same areas after the mass bleaching effect. The presence of species composition of the study area is near about 4 times higher than the study which was made on newly recruited corals after tsunami. Bleaching was the only giant event which occurred in between 2009 and 2012, considered as the prime regulator for the new recruitment of scleractinians. The Shannon-Weaver's species diversity index of the study area ranges from 5.09 to 6.00, Simpson's species density index varies from 0.94 to 0.97 whereas the Pielou's evenness index shows the results in between 0.93 and 0.98. The present paper depicts the species composition, diversity, density and evenness at post bleaching state to signify the constructive role of bleaching towards the settlement of new scleractinian coral life on the preceding places.

Application of the Reciprocal of Simpson's Index to the three types of animals from SDG12 yields a relatively high level of evenness, which implies a broader meat diet of the SDG12 hominids. Compared to values of taxonomic evenness from Mediterranean sites, it is suggested that this dietary expansion probably resulted from the occurrence of the Broad Spectrum Revolution rather than from climatic changes in the Shuidonggou area. Comparative studies between the Natufian phases in Hayonim Cave and the SDG12 validate this argument.

However, it remains relatively unknown to what extent biodiversity can also be enhanced by changing the composition and configuration of farmland per se. We examined relationships between farmland structure and avian biodiversity in six watersheds representing a gradient in rowcrop intensity in the American Mid-west. We used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to model relationships at the site (0.8 ha), field (21 ha), section (165 ha) and watershed (4000-18,000 ha) extents to explore these questions: (1) At what spatial extent do birds respond most strongly to farmland structure? (2) Which farmland variables are most important? (3) Does avian biodiversity increase with increasing farmland heterogeneity? Most variation in bird assemblages was explained at the field versus the site or section extents. Of the top 20 field-extent variables in CCA, most important were: % woodland, an index of compositional heterogeneity (the modified Simpson's evenness index, MSIEI), % rowcrop, % core pasture (i.e., away from an edge), and edge density. Eighteen species were associated with woodland; their richness increased with woodland from 0% to 10%. Nine species were associated with rowcrop; their richness decreased two-fold with a change in rowcrop from 80% to 3%. Twelve species were associated with farmland heterogeneity; their richness increased four-fold with more field cover heterogeneity (MSIEI) and decreased three-fold with increasing mean field size from 1.2 to 7 ha. Field-extent alpha and beta species richness were significantly higher than expected in the null model in the two most heterogeneous watersheds and lower in the two most intensely farmed watersheds. Differences among watersheds were significant and evident in the CCA ordination plot. Our results show empirically that policies to influence farmland heterogeneity could provide a conservation benefit to avian biodiversity.

Macrobenthic fauna is responsible for efficient utilization of sediments and their diversity indicates health of a wetland in accordance to its sediment quality. In the present study, several physico-chemical parameters such as DO (3.03-11.06 ppm), CO2 (4.02-20.0 ppm), alkalinity (36.83-164.0 ppm), total hardness (100.0-270.00 ppm), TDS (450.0-620 ppm), chloride(142.0- 364.2 ppm), pH (7.3-8.5), water transparency (8.0-54.2 cm), organic contents like organic carbon (1.03-10.9mg g(-1))were studied. Variation in macrobenthic fauna from the selected fields were also examined by calculating Simpson's dominance index, evenness index (Pielou index), Shannon's diversity index. 12 taxa of mollusk and 1 taxa of annelid were found in the study and Bellamya and Thiara were the most dominant species which indicated clean water of the pond. The correlation between macrobenthic diversity and physico-chemical parameters were also studied in selected ponds from East Calcutta Wetlands.

Initial Effects of Woody Biomass Removal and Intercropping of Switchgrass (<i>Panicum</i> <i>virgatum</i>) on Herpetofauna in Eastern North Carolina								WILDLIFE SOCIETY BULLETIN				37	2			327	335		10.1002/wsb.248			JUN 2013	2013	Forests are potential sources for a wide range of alternative fuels, which could reduce dependency on fossil fuels and carbon emissions, but sustainability of producing biofuels from forests has not been well-studied. Therefore, we investigated effects of woody biomass harvest, intercropping perennial grasses, and combinations of these treatments on herpetofauna in loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in a randomized and replicated field experiment in eastern North Carolina, USA. We sampled amphibians and small reptiles with drift fence arrays from April to July during 1 and 2 years after treatment establishment. We had 425 captures of 15 species of herpetofauna across the 2 sampling seasons, but did not observe large general effects of biomass removal or planting of switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) in pine plantations on detection, diversity, or relative abundance. However, planned contrasts indicated Simpson's index of diversity was greater in plots managed for switchgrass only compared with pine plantations during year 2, and that captures of southern toads (Anaxyrus terrestris) were less common in switchgrass plots than in pine plantations intercropped with switchgrass. Neither intercropping switchgrass with pine nor removal of harvest residuals caused herpetofauna diversity or abundance of common species to differ from traditional plantation management during the first 2 years following treatment establishment. With the exception of switchgrass-only plots, which had lower herpetofauna species evenness, the potential practices we considered for biofuels production are unlikely to have short-term effects on herpetofauna relative to traditional pine management. Future research should monitor herpetofauna through succession and consider landscape-scale effects and other potential feedstock sources. (C) 2013 The Wildlife Society.

Location Lake Bambili, western Cameroon (05 degrees 56' N, 10 degrees 14' E, 2273 m a.s.l.). Methods Fossil pollen was extracted from a long, continuous and well-dated sedimentary sequence extending back 20,000 years. Pollen diversity and evenness estimates were based on rarefaction analysis and on Simpson's (1/D) index. Results Forest was nearly absent from high elevations during the last glacial period. It expanded gradually from 18.4 cal. kyr bp, interrupted only by reversals coincident with the Heinrich 1 (H1) and Younger Dryas (YD) climatic events, and then suddenly collapsed at 3.3 cal. kyr bp. This switch from forest to grassland communities occurred within a time span of three centuries. After 3.3 cal. kyr bp only short and taxon-poor forest phases are recorded, specifically between 2.7 and 1 cal. kyr bp and in recent centuries. Main conclusions Our data indicate that the mountain forests of Cameroon are recent, resulting from plant migrations from various sources from 18.4 cal. kyr bp onwards. Their progressive development closely followed intensification of the Atlantic monsoon, leading to the formation of a dense forest between 11.7 and 3.3 cal. kyr bp. The composition of this forest included the co-occurrence of species whose ranges do not overlap today, and indicates the potential for the development of unique iterations of climax forests through time. These forests appear to be very sensitive to Northern Hemisphere climate change, with phases of expansion/contraction coeval with the boreal deglacial signal, including widely recognized events such as H1, the YD and the 8.2 ka event. From 8.2 cal. kyr bp onwards, the progressive opening of the canopy is likely to reflect increased seasonality in rainfall related to more frequent El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The final step of this history was the collapse of the montane forest at 3.3 cal. kyr bp. During the last millennium, very severe disruptions have meant that only the most rapidly dispersing species could spread, contributing to a drastic loss of forest biodiversity that has been accentuated by human impact in the last few centuries.

HYDROBIOLOGIA				701	1			159	172		10.1007/s10750-012-1248-0			JAN 2013	2013	Although disturbance and productivity are clearly strong influences on lotic diversity, rarely have their interactive effects been studied in running water systems. We hypothesised that the presence or absence of canopy cover in streams would alter productivity-disturbance-diversity relationships due to differential effects on the food base, and tested this hypothesis in 47 mountain streams in the central North Island of New Zealand. Canopy cover had no influence on algal biomass in these streams, but a link between disturbance and productivity was found in open canopy streams where taxonomic richness of invertebrates increased log-linearly with increasing algal biomass and peaked at intermediate levels of disturbance. Community evenness declined with disturbance, but only at closed canopy sites where both invertebrate taxonomic richness and Simpson's diversity index were higher. Although there was a peak in richness at intermediate rates of disturbance, our results do not directly match predictions of the dynamic equilibrium model which predicts that the level of disturbance maximising diversity interacts with habitat productivity. Rather, we suggest the combined effects of productivity and disturbance are additive rather than multiplicative such that productivity simply sets the upper limit to richness in streams.

Temporal shifts in the biodiversity of nearshore small fishes in Lake Simcoe								JOURNAL OF GREAT LAKES RESEARCH				38	4			643	652		10.1016/j.jglr.2012.09.006			DEC 2012	2012	Nearshore small fish species represent a large proportion of fish biodiversity in Lake Simcoe, a large inland lake in southern Ontario, Canada. Over the past 30 years, Lake Simcoe has experienced several changes to its aquatic habitat, benthic invertebrate communities and predatory fish populations. This study compared samples of the nearshore small fish community in three geographic areas of Lake Simcoe. Fish community data were grouped into two time periods: a contemporary period (2007-2009) and a historical period (1982-1995). The fish community was compared across time periods for each area to assess if observed ecological changes had an impact on the small fish community. Species richness significantly declined between time periods in two areas (Cook's Bay and the southeast shoreline), the number of individuals captured declined between time periods in one area of the lake (Kempenfelt Bay) and Simpson's diversity index declined between time periods in one area of the lake (southeast shoreline). There were no significant differences in the Shannon-Weiner evenness index between time periods in any of the study areas. Additional analyses of intra- and inter-annual variation in fish sampling results generally supported the findings that shifts in the fish community occurred between time periods. Overall, this study suggests that the nearshore small fish biodiversity of lake Simcoe has shifted over time but these shifts are not clearly related to recent increases in water clarity, macrophyte growth and nearshore benthic invertebrate densities.

The objective of this research is to identity controlling environmental variables over natural restoration process in middle Taihang Mountain of North China using multivariate techniques of detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA). Vegetation and soil surveys were performed in 144 permanent sampling plots in Niujiazhuang Catchment in 1986 and 2008. Vegetation variables include shrub height, shrub coverage, shrub biomass, herb height, herb coverage, herb biomass, species richness (S), Shannon-Wiener's (H), Simpson's predominance index (D), and evenness index (J(sw)). Topographic variables include elevation, slope, slope position, and slope aspect. Soil variables include soil thickness, humus thickness, rock content, soil organic matter, and total N, P, and K. Results indicate that the most important factors that influence the composition of vegetation assemblages (diversity, distribution and above-ground biomass) were total K in 1986 and total P in 2008. Also, the results suggest significant correlations among vegetation variables, soil nutrient contents, and topographic variables. For example, total N, P, and K were positively correlated with soil organic matter significantly. Relationships between vegetation and environmental variables over long-term natural restoration provide some valuable implications for regional ecological restoration and land management. To restore the degraded ecosystems, maintain the diversity and structure of ecosystems in middle Taihang Mountain, we should consider the co-evolution of both vegetation and soil, and also natural succession sequence.

If the effects of grazing on plant diversity have been extensively studied in a wide range of ecosystems, effects of controlled grazing are still largely unknown. Species diversity indices are useful indicators of the sustainability of collective rangelands in southern Tunisia. In order to determine an optimal management method of arid rangelands with high heritage value, we examined the respective effects of continuous grazing, moderate grazing and rest on the plant community's diversity. We compared diversity indices of the vegetation for three levels of grazing pressure (null, moderate and heavy) in the collective rangelands dominated by Gymnocarpos decander, Hammada schmittiana, Stipagrostis pungens and Anthyllis sericea of Dhahars in the south-eastern region of Tataouine (Tunisia). Species richness and Simpson's diversity tended to decrease with increased grazing pressure, but the difference was not significant between ungrazed and moderately grazed rangelands. By contrast, species evenness tended to increase with grazing pressure. Diversity and vegetation biological spectrum were only slightly affected by controlled grazing. This study demonstrates the value of this management practice for biodiversity conservation.

Detailed sampling was carried out in 180 forest stands (30 x 30 m) at 13 sites. Average number of vascular plant species found per site was between 30 and 40; Menhinick's Richness was 0.93-1.63; Simpson's Diversity Index between 0.75 and 2.27; Shannon's Evenness between 0.21 and 0.71; the Maturity Index 38 to 53. Species diversity and community structure patterns were significantly correlated to environmental variables including altitude and slope inclination as well as intensity of anthropogenic pressure. Abies pindrow and Pinus wallichiana showed exclusive dominance comprising 30% Importance Value Index (IVI) weight age of all 122 recorded species. Forest ground flora was dominated by grasses of the Poaceae. Average tree density was 151 ha(-1) whereas basal area was estimated as 68.8 m(2) ha(-1). A stem/stump value of 1.62 indicated immense tree felling and logging pressure on local forests. A disturbed forest regeneration pattern was indicated by an average seedling count 124 ha(-1). A negative correlation (CCA) was found between diversity and richness with altitudinal gradient as well as slope and aspect. Diversity values were similar, whereas tree density, basal area and seedling count were lower, compared to other Himalayan forest sites. These results indicate a deteriorated forest structure and reduced regeneration pattern, demanding immediate attention of forest management authorities. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The aim of this research was to study the behavior of herbaceous plants suitable for sowing in mixes in order to revegetate soils in different urban environments. Three different mixes of herbaceous plants were studied: N (native) was composed of autochthonous species, US (urban short) and UT (urban tall) were composed of both autochthonous and allochthonous species. Plant height was lower than 60 cm in N and US, and above 60 cm in UT. Each mix was sown in three randomized plots and each plot was mown at three different times: 110, 140 and 170 days after sowing (early, mid and late season respectively). Number of plants per square meter, plant height and biomass were recorded at each mowing time. In order to assess how well the plants would establish themselves we calculated the Shannon diversity index, the evenness of species and Simpson's index of dominance. The N mix composed of autochthonous species resulted to be well-balanced with an equal number of annual and perennial species grown. The presence of annuals and perennials made the community richer and the individual plants more evenly distributed. The best mowing time to improve diversity in all the mixes was late-season.

In total, 202,968 effective sequences of the 16S rRNA gene were generated from 16 samples that widely represented the diversity of the microbial communities. While Proteobacteria was found to be the dominant phylum in some samples, in other samples it was Bacteroidetes. The Simpson's diversity index and evenness index were lowest in samples from membrane bioreactors (MBRs), possibly due to the long sludge retention time (SRT) and low food/microorganism ratio (F/M). For one WWTP which had two disparate treatment processes operating in parallel, the structures of microbial communities in the two systems were compared. The differences found between the two indicated that the treatment process likely had effects on the structure of microbial communities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Monitoring conservation versus conventional tillage effects on soil microbes could improve our understanding of soil biochemical processes and thus help us to develop sound management strategies. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of conservation tillage on the spore community structure and the diversity of soil arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and to find out the main factors that influence these parameters. A long-term field experiment established in a sandy loam soil in Northern China has received continuous tillage management treatments for 3 years, including conventional tillage (CT), no tillage (NT), and alternating tillage (AT). Topsoil samples (0-15 cm) from four individual plots per treatment were collected for the analysis of chemical properties and fungal parameters. AM fungal spores were isolated using the wet-sieving method and identified to species level based on morphology by light microscopy. The community structure and the diversity of AM fungi were evaluated using the following parameters: spore density, relative abundance, species richness, Shannon-Wiener index ('), evenness (), and Simpson's index (). Jaccard index () of similarity was calculated to compare AM fungal species composition under different treatments. Twenty-eight species of AM fungi within four genera, , , , and , were recovered from the 12 plots within the three tillage management treatments. Higher spore density, species richness, and species diversity (', , and ) of AM fungi were observed in the two conservation tillage treatments, and the redundancy analysis showed that the species richness significantly correlated to soil organic carbon content ( < 0.05). The positive effects of NT and AT on the species richness were very close, while the AT had relatively greater beneficial impacts on the spore density and the evenness of AM fungi compared to the NT. The lowest Jaccard index () of similarity in species composition was also observed between the AT and CT treatments. Soil organic carbon, the spore density, and species richness and diversity of AM fungi increased in the two conservation tillage treatments. The species richness of AM fungi significantly correlated to soil organic carbon content ( < 0.05). Compared with the CT treatment, the AT rather than the NT significantly increased the spore density and the evenness of AM fungi ( < 0.05). Thus, alternating tillage practice may be more beneficial to agroecosystem in this region.

J	Yashiro, Erika; McManus, Patricia S.								Effect of Streptomycin Treatment on Bacterial Community Structure in the Apple Phyllosphere								PLOS ONE				7	5					e37131	10.1371/journal.pone.0037131			MAY 21 2012	2012	We studied the effect of many years of streptomycin use in apple orchards on the proportion of phyllosphere bacteria resistant to streptomycin and bacterial community structure. Leaf samples were collected during early July through early September from four orchards that had been sprayed with streptomycin during spring of most years for at least 10 years and four orchards that had not been sprayed. The percentage of cultured phyllosphere bacteria resistant to streptomycin at non-sprayed orchards (mean of 65%) was greater than at sprayed orchards (mean of 50%) (P = 0.0271). For each orchard, a 16S rRNA gene clone library was constructed from leaf samples. Proteobacteria dominated the bacterial communities at all orchards, accounting for 71 of 104 OTUs (determined at 97% sequence similarity) and 93% of all sequences. The genera Massilia, Methylobacterium, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, and Sphingomonas were shared across all sites. Shannon and Simpson's diversity indices and Pielou's evenness index were similar among orchards regardless of streptomycin use. Analysis of Similarity (ANOSIM) indicated that long-term streptomycin treatment did not account for the observed variability in community structure among orchards (R = -0.104, P = 0.655). Other variables, including time of summer, temperature and time at sampling, and relative distance of the orchards from each other, also had no significant effect on bacterial community structure. We conclude that factors other than streptomycin exposure drive both the proportion of streptomycin-resistant bacteria and phylogenetic makeup of bacterial communities in the apple phyllosphere in middle to late summer.

The purpose of this study was to research and survey the effects of transgenic insect-resistant cottons that had been planted over 10 years on the abundance and community structure of soil invertebrates under field conditions. During 3 consecutive years (2006-2008), eight common taxa (orders) of soil invertebrates belonging to the phylum Arthropoda were investigated in two different transgenic cotton fields and one non-transgenic cotton field (control). Each year, soil samples were taken at four different growth stages of cotton (seedling, budding, boll forming and boll opening). Animals were extracted from the samples using the improved Tullgren method, counted and determined to the order level. The diversity of the soil fauna communities in the different fields was compared using the Simpson's, Shannon's diversity indices and evenness index. The results showed a significant sampling time variation in the abundance of soil invertebrates monitored in the different fields. However, no difference in soil invertebrate abundance was found between the transgenic cotton fields and the control field. Both sampling time and cotton treatment had a significant effect on the Simpson's, Shannon's diversity indices and evenness index. They were higher in the transgenic fields than the control field at the growth stages of cotton. Long-term cultivation of transgenic insect-resistant cottons had no significant effect on the abundance of soil invertebrates. Collembola, Acarina and Araneae could act as the indicators of soil invertebrate in this region to monitor the environmental impacts of transgenic plants in the future.

Richness and evenness can be studied using Simpson's Index with its associated Reciprocal Index, and with Shannon-Weiner's Index "H" and Index "E". Lieberson provides the means to measure isolation and interaction, and Dissimilarity works well to identify segregated communities. Results using these indices show that the Historically Black College of Dentistry is a culturally vibrant and diverse academic and social environment. White students at the Historically Black College of Dentistry are more likely to enjoy interaction with other Whites than will Historically Black and Hispanic students at all other dental schools, except at the other Medical College, the only other HBCU with a dental school. Overall, there was no statistical diversity difference between the Historically Black College of Dentistry and all other dental schools over the 10 year study period. Statistically significant correlations between each index provided a framework for using each index in prediction modeling. Recent methods to manage multi-collinearity, such as extracting unstandardized residuals to use as adjusted coefficients add promise that all indices can be used in future diversity studies.

J	Williams, Rachel L.; Goodenough, Anne E.; Stafford, Richard								Statistical precision of diet diversity from scat and pellet analysis								ECOLOGICAL INFORMATICS				7	1			30	34		10.1016/j.ecoinf.2011.08.004			JAN 2012	2012	Knowledge of trophic interactions is of vital importance for understanding ecological community dynamics. While techniques such as direct observation of prey consumption and stomach content analysis are suitable for some species; for wide ranging carnivores, especially those of conservation concern, analysis of matter in faecal scats or regurgitated pellets is still common practice. This study investigates sample sizes needed to predict changes in the diversity of the diet of three carnivore species (grey seals, Mexican wolves and long horned owls). Using a bootstrapping process, estimations of precision of diet diversity (i.e. the number and evenness of prey species, as measured using Simpson's index) were made with increasing sample sizes (numbers of scats/pellets sampled). Precision of diversity of diet was much greater for grey seals than for owls or wolves, largely because the number of prey items (remains of individuals of the same or different species) in a scat was much higher. When these results are used to test hypotheses to determine difference in diet diversity, the results show that changes in seal diet diversity between different areas of the North Sea could be elucidated with analysis of as few as three scats from each region. However, demonstrating differences in diet diversity between different, but related, owl species from the same area would not be possible even if the contents of 500 pellets were analysed. This study provides tools and guidelines for sample size requirements in scat or pellet analysis for future studies, as well as indicating that in some cases - for example in grey seals - scat samples may be an efficient method of investigating changes in diet diversity, and hence niche breath, which may alter with prey availability as caused by anthropogenic pressures such as climate change and fishing.

The aim of the present study was to test the response of benthic invertebrates to hydromorphological (HM) alterations and to develop a new index for the assessment of HM alterations of the rocky shore, based on benthic invertebrates. Fifty samples were collected, 10 from pre-classified HM classes 1, 3, 5; 15 from class 2, and 5 from class 4. Seven HM variables describing habitat conditions were used to test the benthic invertebrate response and to develop the HM stressor gradient: material, texture, structure, belt length, sedimentation, water retention and artificially induced mobility. Abundance, some diversity (Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's and Evenness) and richness (number of taxa) metrics showed low correlation values (r < 0.5) against HM variables and HM stressor gradient, indicating that tested metrics have limited value in assessment of the HM degradation impact on coastal benthic invertebrates. On the other hand, significant differences in the structure of benthic invertebrate assemblages among HM classes were observed (One-way ANOSIM global test r = 0.53, P < 0.0001). In the partial canonical correspondence analyses each of seven HM variables statistically significantly (P < 0.05) explained individual portion of the benthic invertebrate taxa variability. HM indicative values ranging from 1 to 9 were defined for each of 229 taxa, according to its distribution along the five HM classes. HM indicative weights (WHM) between 1 and 5 were defined according to the valences distribution among HM classes. HM indicative values, WHM and log 5 abundance classes were combined in a new Benthic Index for Rocky Shore (BIRS), using the weighted average approach. The combination of all three parameters in the BIRS showed a statistically significant (P < 0.05) response of the new developed index to HM stressor gradient, with a high Pearson correlation coefficient (r = 0.97). Further work has to be done in order to develop a WFD compliant method with five classes' boundary values. Nevertheless, the new developed index has a good potential to contribute to existing coastal assessment systems. Especially, as impact of hydromorphological alterations on coastal communities was almost neglected so far, despite being one of the main threats to coastal water integrity. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The quantitative aspects of pedodiversity of a soilscape in South-East Sicily, where some types of soils, in recent decades, have suffered a consistent reduction due to the transformations by large scale farming, are considered. The evolution of pedodiversity over a 53-year period (1955 to 2008) is examined using a dedicated statistical method and a space-time model based on Markov analysis and cellular automata in order to predict the evolution of the soilscape pattern in the next 42 years (i.e. until 2050). Soil subgroups, using the USDA Soil Taxonomy and a classification proposal, were considered and the following indices were used: richness; Shannon's diversity index; Simpson diversity index; modified Simpson's diversity index; Shannon's evenness index; Simpson's evenness index and modified Simpson's evenness index. These indices measured over time, show, quantitatively, a decrease in pedodiversity that highlights the effect of the human intervention in modifying the natural order of the soilscape.

Changes in species diversity and above-ground biomass of shrubland over long-term natural restoration process in the Taihang Mountain in North China								PLANT SOIL AND ENVIRONMENT				57	11			505	512		10.17221/216/2011-PSE			NOV 2011	2011	In order to restore the impaired forest ecosystem in China, great efforts including the banning of the animal grazing and cutting woods for fuel, and implementation of the 'Grain for Green' program have been made by the central and local government of China. The objective of this research was to investigate the changes in above-ground biomass and species diversity after 22 years of vegetation recovery efforts in the lower Taihang Mountain of China. The results indicated that over the natural restoration process shrubs became the dominant species in 2008, while herbs were the dominant species back in 1986. Community coverage, height and above-ground biomass showed significant increases in 2008 compared to 1986. Shrubs showed significant increases in coverage, height, and above-ground biomass, whereas herbs significantly increased in height, but decreased in above-ground biomass. Over the 22-year natural restoration process, the species richness index and the Shannon-Wiener's index had been significantly decreased, whereas the Simpson's predominance index and the Pielou's evenness index had been significantly increased. Long-term vegetation recovery efforts improved the impaired forest ecosystem in lower Taihang Mountain to some extent: significant increases in both community coverage and above-ground biomass. The significant increase in community coverage can reduce the soil loss by wind and water erosion, and increase in the above-ground biomass will improve the soil chemical properties and physical structure. A comprehensive assessment of the success of vegetation recovery should include the evaluation of the changes in ecological process such as soil biological activities in the future research.

J	Asgharipour, Mohammad R.; Rafiei, Majid								The effects of land use on biomass and catabolic diversity of soil microbial communities								AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH				6	19			4607	4612					SEP 19 2011	2011	An understanding of the factors influencing microbial diversity in soils is essential to predict the effects of current land use trends on diversity. In this study, the effects of soil management (high and low input systems and pasture) on microbial biomass and diversity was investigated. Respiration responses to specific substrate were used to measure soil microbial diversity. Catabolic evenness and richness of microorganisms as a measure of soil microbial diversity was measured. In comparison with agricultural systems, pasture resulted in an increase in organic matter and microbial biomass. However, in the soil managements, in high input systems, basal respiration was higher than other soil managements, suggesting the presence of a small but highly metabolically active micro floral community. Analysis of catabolic response profiles demonstrated that there were large differences in the catabolic capability of the soil microbial communities under different soil management type. Values for Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices indicated that greatest catabolic existed under native grassland and least diversity under high input systems. This was attributed to broad range of organic pool in pasture. It was concluded that soil management has a substantial effects on the size, activity and diversity of the soil microbial community and that these changes could be broadly related to changes in soil organic matter content. Although the implications of losses of microbial diversity are unknown, but diversity may results more resilient to stresses or disturbances.

Simpson's diversity ranged from 0.85 to 1.96; Menhinick's diversity, 1.49 to 1.37; evenness, 0.23 to 0.61; average species richness per site, 36 to 40 and maturity index, 41 to 44. Deterrended correspondence analyses ( DCA) revealed the altitude as the most influential factor controlling species distribution pattern. Diversity values were similar to the other Himalayan forests, whereas density, basal area and seedling count were very low. 89.6% of the human population was dependent on forest resources for fuel and energy requirements. Annual fuel wood consumption was 6.7 metric tons, 2.2 kg capita(-1)day(-1).

This paper compares the impact of mowing and grazing on butterfly biodiversity in two S Italian (Campania) grasslands, at Campo Somma (CS) and Pianoro di Prada (PP) located at an identical altitude of 850 m. These grasslands have an area of approximately 6 ha each and are at a 3 km distance from each other. They share similar climate and are both surrounded by woods, mainly of sweet chestnut. CS is managed for haying and is mown once a year, in June. PP is used for sheep and cattle grazing. Weekly transects were made from April to September in 2008 and 2009, during the butterfly flight activity. We analysed data from eight monthly transects by Kruskal- Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. We observed 45 butterfly species at PP, and 28 at CS. Diversity indexes were significantly higher at PP, whereas evenness was similar. The monthly comparisons of species richness showed that, except for April, PP values were always significantly higher. Species abundance was significantly higher at PP in June, July and August. In all months, except in April, the Shannon-Wiener index was also significantly higher at PP, as was Simpson's index in May, June and September. Dominance index differed significantly only in May, June and September, whereas evenness was never significantly different between the two grasslands. These data show that, as concerns butterflies, the impact of mowing was much stronger than that of grazing.

Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, BIOLOG (TM) substrate usage, production of extracellular enzymes (xylanase and cellulase) and plant growth promoting attributes were applied to monitor changes in genetic and metabolic diversity of streptomycetes. Significant variation was observed for production of extracellular enzymes, Indolic compounds, siderophore and P-solubilisation among isolates. Metabolic substrate usage of Streptomyces isolates was evaluated using the BIOLOG (TM) GP2 plates and unique carbon substrate usage profiles were observed. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the isolates were identified as Streptomyces variabilis, Streptomyces spp. S. glaucescens, S. viridochromogenes, S. cinnabarinus, S. aburaviensis, S. viridis, S. xylophagus, S. macrosporeus, S. thermocarboxydus, and S. albogriseolus. The diversity index parameters like Shannon index, reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D), and Pielou index of evenness based on ARDRA revealed that streptomycetes community in effluent irrigated field (EIF) was more diverse. DGGE profiles of Streptomyces specific 16S rRNA gene fragments (16S-DGGE) amplified directly from soil samples were highly similar in both soils.

The effects of BGA-5 on the target pest Plagiodera versicolora (Coleoptera, Chrysomelidae) and a non-target pest Clostera anachoreta (Lepidoptera, Notodontidae), were assessed under laboratory conditions. Total mortality of P. versicolora larvae fed with BGA-5 leaves was significantly higher than that of the control (P < 0.05). The exuviation index of P. versicolora larvae fed with BGA-5 tended to be higher than that of CK, but it was not significantly different. The pupation rate and eclosion rate of the survived larvae fed with BGA-5 were lower than that of CK, but it was also not significantly different. Additionally, no significant differences were detected in the mortality, exuviations index, pupation rate, or eclosion rate of C. anachoreta fed with leaves of transgenic and non-transgenic poplars. Furthermore, the arthropod communities in the Bt poplar and CK field stands were similar, as indicated by four diversity indices (Berge-Parker index, Shannon-Wiener indices, evenness index, and Simpson's inverted index) and the Bray-Curtis index. Therefore, the Bt-Cry3A poplar decreased damage by the target pest (P. versicolora), had no effects on a non-target pest (C. anachoreta), and generally did not have any significant negative effect on the poplar arthropod community.

We explore the profound similarities between these diametric notions, construct a mathematical transformation between them, and show how randomness can be used to measure evenness - and vice versa. In particular, we devise and study Renyi's index a randomness-based measure of evenness with special properties. Renyi's index is established as an effectual gauge of statistical heterogeneity in the context of general probability laws defined on the positive half-line. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Four alpine pastures were investigated to study species distribution patterns, richness, similarity, and community structure in Bagh District, Azad Kashmir, Pakistan. Four communities, Poa-Primula-Sibbaldia, Primula-Caltha-Primula, Poa alpina-Poa pratensis-Scirpus, and Sibbaldia-Poa-Scirpus, were identified on the basis of an importance value index. The average value of species richness was 1.42; Simpson's and Shannon-Wiener's diversity values were 3.13 and 0.91, respectively; the degree of maturity index was 44.1; and species evenness was 0.901. Local alpine flora was dominated by a hemicriptophytic life form with microphyllous leaf spectra. The species-environment correlation was analyzed using canonical correspondence analysis. A negative correlation of both diversity and richness was revealed with altitudinal gradient. Anthropogenic disturbances showed a significant negative impact on distribution of medicinal and palatable species. Unpalatable species dominated the local flora, indicating the heavy grazing pressure in the area. Development and implementation of regional conservation strategies are recommended to protect the threatened Himalayan alpine biodiversity.

J	Kent, Rafi; Carmel, Yohay								Evaluation of five clustering algorithms for biodiversity surrogates								ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS				11	3			896	901		10.1016/j.ecolind.2010.12.005			MAY 2011	2011	Conservation planning requires knowledge of the distribution of all species in the area of interest. Surrogates for biodiversity are considered as a possible solution. The two major types are biological and environmental surrogates. Here, we evaluate four different methods of hierarchical clustering, as well as one non-hierarchical method, in the context of producing surrogates for biodiversity. Each clustering method was used to produce maps of both surrogate types. We evaluated the representativeness of each clustering method by finding the average number of species represented in a set of sites, one site of each domain, which was carried out with Monte-Carlo permutations procedure. We propose an additional measure of surrogate performance, which is the degree of evenness of the different domains, e.g., by calculating Simpson's diversity index. Surrogates with low evenness leave little flexibility in site selection since often some of the domains may be represented by a single or very few sites, and thus surrogate maps with a high Simpson's index value may be more relevant for actual decision making. We found that there is a trade-off between species representativeness and evenness. Centroid clustering represented the most species, but had very low values of evenness. Ward's method of minimum variance represented more species than a random choice, and had high evenness values. Using the typical evaluation measures, the Centroid clustering method was most efficient for surrogate production. However, when Simpson's index is also considered, Ward's method of minimum variance is more appropriate for managers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Jafari, Naser; Nabavi, Saiad Mohamad; Akhavan, Moslem								ECOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF ZOOPLANKTON ABUNDANCE IN THE RIVER HARAZ, NORTHEAST IRAN: IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES								ARCHIVES OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES				63	3			785	798		10.2298/ABS1103785J			2011	2011	The influence of physicochemical properties of Haraz river on its zooplankton composition and abundance were investigated at three sites for one year between August 2009 and July 2010. The present study records for the first time the aspects of zooplankton diversity and composition in relation to the physicochemical environment of the Haraz river. Only three groups of zooplankton were found: Rotifera with eighteen genera; Cladocera with nine and Copepoda with six genera. Rotifera was the predominant group (64.89%), followed by Cladocera (19.62%) and Copepoda (15.32%). Upstream, the abundance was 805 individuals/m(3), while it varied from 922 to 1126 ind/m(3) downstream. Alkaline pH and nutrients were the main environmental factors which affected zooplankton abundance in the river. Site variation in dominance, diversity, evenness and richness were calculated. The study revealed that the presence of certain species, such as Lepadella sp., Mesocyclops sp., Polyarthra sp. and Brachionus sp. is considered to be a biological indicator for eutrophication. The calculated Jack1 values of sites 1 to 3 were 7.624, 16.426 and 19.221, respectively. The Shannon-Wiever species diversity index (H') values were also different for all the three sites viz., site 1 (1.992), site 2 (1.21) and site 3 (2.48). Simpson's dominance index (H) value was highest at site 1 (0.692), indicating maximum dominance, whereas at site 3 dominance was the lowest (0.227) and diversity was the highest. Overall, our results showed that changes in the water quality of the river Haraz have considerable effects on the composition of zooplankton assemblages that can potentially affect the functioning of these ecosystems.

In our paper we compared two main field survey approaches for forest vegetation recording, the Chinese and the European ("phyto-sociological") one, for their differences and efficiency when applied to the plant communities of temperate forests. The Chinese approach uses a design with different plot sizes for recording the tree, shrub and herb layer species, respectively, while the European one uses the same plot size for recording all layers and species. The two approaches result in significant differences in species richness (Simpson's diversity index and the Shannon-Wiener index), while there is no difference in the evenness index. The European approach has the ability to survey the number of different species more precisely than the Chinese one. For detecting the general patterns of diversity, however, the two approaches have the same ability, demonstrated here for the altitudinal gradient.

Michoacan, is described. Sampling was conducted twice in each season (8 trips in total), and additionally some physicochemical variables of the river channel were recorded. Strata (shores, riffles and eddies) and seasonal variation of assemblages are described and compared using classical diversity measures such as Shannon's diversity index, Simpson's diversity index as a dominance measure, Margalef's richness index and Pielou's evenness index. For comparing strata and seasonal diversity the Renyis diversity profiles were used. A Cluster Analysis was performed on a Bray-Curtis similarity matrix to explore the faunal relationships among year seasons and strata. CCA was also performed to investigate the relationships between the physicochemical and species abundance matrixes. As results, 28 spp. (12 Zygoptera and 16 Anisoptera) were recorded as larvae. Most abundant species were Erpetogomphus claps. Brechmorhoga praecox and Phyllogomphoides The highest number of spp. was registered in winter and the lowest in summer. Among strata the highest abundance was recorded in riffles, although the shoreline had the largest number of spp. The most similar assemblages were those of autumn and winter. Shore habitats were more heterogeneous than eddies and riffles and this could explain the larger number of species. The Clench's model explains better the data. Additionally, we used the slope of cumulative number of spp. curve for assessing completeness of the RP list. CCA was significant, with pH, autumn, shoreline and riffles the most important variables. This means that species variation is related to physicochemical, temporal and strata conditions in RP.		[Gomes-Anaya, J.

The decrease was particularly marked for C. cyanus, S. hortensis, and A. houstonianum, and plots intercropped with these aromatic plants also had significantly higher values of ratios of natural enemies to pests, Simpson's index, the Shannon-Wiener index, and the evenness index of arthropod species at the flowering, immature-fruits, and fruit-growth stages of the pear trees. In none of the plots except that intercropped with C. cyanus, however, were there any significant changes in the abundance of predators and parasitoids. Intercropping with aromatic plants in pear orchards proved beneficial to the main crop by repelling pests and regulating the structure of the arthropod community in the pear orchard ecosystem.

Present study emphasizes the nature and status of floral diversity in the vicinity of Integrated Industrial Estate-Pan in agar, Uttarakhand, India (IIE-Pantnagar). Three monitoring locations were selected in the vicinity of industrial estate and data were collected to compute species richness, evenness, Importance Value Index (IVI), Shannon and Wiener Species Diversity Index and Simpson's Index of biodiversity. Cynodon dactylon was found to be major dominant species among all three monitoring locations, followed by Sorghum halepense and Parthenium sp. The Simpson's index of biodiversity varied at a range of 0.28 to 0.41, signifying the presence of less biodiversity. Species evenness, a measure of relative abundance of the different species was at a range of 0.36 to 0.46. Monitoring location outside industrial area (site-2) revealed slight higher diversity with Shannon and Wiener Species Diversity Index of 0.742 in comparison to other monitoring locations inside the industrial area. Mostly the encountered vegetation were found as invasive species, therefore, recommendations were hereby made to take precautions regarding its further spread. Development and maintenance of greenbelt in and around industrial area were also suggested.		[Banerjee, T.; Srivastava, R.

A total of 50 species of intertidal organisms were recorded from these shores. Shannon and Simpson's diversity index, Margalef's richness index and Pielou's evenness index indicated different level of ecological state of the shore in different months. Dendrograms and 2-D non metric MDS ordination from Bray-Curtis similarity matrix of occurrence of intertidal organisms from these sites showed highest similarity and combination pattern of occurrence between Nerita oryzarum and Planaxis sulcatus in TIFR and Bandstand shore. Nerita oryzarum and Tactarius malaccanus at NCPA shore. Abundance/biomass comparison (ABC) method of determining level of disturbance also pointed towards the polluted status of these shores. Study concludes that though these beaches are highly disturbed due to anthropogenic activities, they still support a rich intertidal biodiversity which need immediate attention for protection and conservation.

Six lakes were chosen for comparative study of species composition and diversity in relation to environmental variations. Lake heterogeneity was described with environmental physico-chemical variables, using principal component analysis. Sixteen families, composed of 75 species of fish were found in the studied lakes, Cyprinidae being the dominant group. Fish species were divided by habitat preference and trophic guild: benthopelagic and herbivorous fish were the most common guilds in all lakes. Species diversity and richness were significantly higher in spring, while the evenness, expressed by equitability of Simpson's index, was not significantly different among seasons. Species richness and diversity were significantly higher in vegetated lakes (e. g. Liangzihu Lake) than in non-vegetated lakes (e. g. Biandantang Lake), with the largest area (Liangzihu Lake) harbouring the largest species richness and the greatest diversity. The relationship between environmental variables and fish assemblage were analysed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). The dominant gradients describing species composition and abundance among the sampling sites were: total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, transparency and water depth. Our study led to the following conclusions: 1) the water quality was better - i.e. high transparency, low total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) and chlorophyll a- in vegetated lakes than in unvegetated lakes; 2) vegetated lakes had higher fish diversity than unvegetated lakes; 3) fish relative abundance (CPUE: number of fish per fishing pass) was significantly related to water chemical parameters. Consequently, the details of the findings are useful and relevant for developing suitable conservation strategies to sustain the integrity of fish communities in these lakes.

Sixty samples were collected from each site and examined for fungi. In total, 60 fungal taxa were identified including 29 ascomycetes, 27 anamorphic taxa and 4 unidentified species. The data obtained from the three sites were then used to calculate frequency of occurrence, species richness, Margalef index, Simpson's index (D), Shannon-Weiner index (H') and species evenness (E). The fungal diversity from Site 2 (waterfall with abundant trees) was higher than that from Site 1 (river near agricultural zone) and Site 3 (waterfall with scrub). Interestingly, Acrogenospora sphaerocephala, Canalisporium caribense, Corynesporium sp., Didymella aptrootii, Fluminicola bipolaris, Halosarphaeia aquadulcis, Helicomyces roseus and Savoryella lignicola were frequently recorded in all sites.

Non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and one-way analysis of similarities (ANOSIM) were used to investigate the effects of taxonomic resolution on the macroinvertebrate assemblage structure. The Mann Whitney U-test and discrimination efficiency were used to assess the ability of nine diversity measures (total richness, rarefied richness samples of 25, 50 and 100 individuals, Margalef's index, Pielou's evenness, Shannon-Weaver's index, Simpson's index and percent dominant taxon) to discriminate between acceptable (best available and good conditions) and unacceptable (moderate, poor and very poor) conditions using three levels of taxonomic resolution: (i) family, (ii) family plus subfamilies of benthic non-biting midges and (iii) genus level. Based on non-metric MDS, the macroinvertebrate assemblages of ponds of acceptable (A) and unacceptable (N) conditions were statistically undistinguishable, both at genus and family levels. On the other hand, based on several community metrics (total richness, Margalef index, etc.) the two sets of samples were statistically different, although only when the genus or the subfamily level was used and after Bonferroni correction. These results suggest that the structure of macroinvertebrate assemblages by itself is more sensitive than the specific composition in distinguishing the fauna living in acceptable and unacceptable conditions. Moreover, dealing with families including many taxa generally showing different tolerance to disturbance may lead to misclassification of ponds. We agree, however, that the two approaches, i.e. assemblage composition and diversity measures, are conceptually different and hence they should be used in combination for a better understanding of the response of single metrics.

Of the sixty-five ISSR primers screened, seven produced highly reproducible bands. Using these primers, a total of 76 DNA fragments were generated with 22 (29.0%) being polymorphic, indicating lower genetic variation at the species level compared to others in the same genus. With the use of 22 polymorphic markers, we were able to identify 9 genets among the 231 samples analyzed. The proportion of distinguishable genets (PD: mean 0.039), Simpson's diversity index (D: mean 0.309), and evenness (E: mean 0.292) exhibited low levels of clonal diversity compared to other clonal plants. The result implies that sexual reproduction might not have played an important role in these populations. The founder effect or the bottleneck effect could be responsible for the current pattern of the genetic variation revealed in S. lichuanensis populations.

Species Diversity and Qualitative Assessment of Ground Beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) in Three Riparian Habitats								ENVIRONMENTAL ENTOMOLOGY				39	3			738	752		10.1603/EN09049			JUN 2010	2010	In a 3-yr study involving saltcedar-free, saltcedar-infested, and burned habitats in a riparian area at Lake Meredith, TX, the number of carabid species collected, diversity indices, and indicator species varied significantly among habitats. A 3-yr average of 15, 14, and 24 carabid species were collected from the saltcedar-free, saltcedar-infested, and burned habitats, respectively. Values for species richness, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices, and evenness index for pooled data collected from 2005 to 2007 were higher in the burned habitat followed by the saltcedar-free habitat and the saltcedar-infested habitat. Within-year parameters across the three habitats generally followed the pooled data results with some variation. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analyses clearly indicated groups of carabid species preferred specific habitats. Five species in the burned area had indicator species percentage values >50% (Agonum punctiforme, Agonum texanum, Brachinus alternans, Harpalus pensylvanicus, and Poecilus chalcites). In the saltcedar-infested and saltcedar-free habitats, only one species in each habitat had indicator species percentage values that exceeded 50%: Calathus opaculus and Cicindela punctulata punctulata, respectively.

This invasive diatom can form thick and extensive benthic layers in stable flow and oligotrophic rivers. This study aimed to evaluate the potential effect of didymo on the macrobenthic community structure of the Matapedia River. Macrobenthic samples were obtained in 2006, upstream of the blooms and, at the same sampling sites a year later, when they were affected by didymo. The Causapscal River remained free of didymo blooms for both years; therefore, this tributary is considered as a control site. Results show a significant difference (P < 0.001) in the community distribution before and after didymo presence in two of the three sites. Significant data show an increase Chironomidae proportions in all the sites (P = 0.011). Significantly higher benthic macroinvertebrate (BMI) densities were also observed in 2007 (P < 0.001). Simpson's Evenness Index and total family richness was not significantly different when comparing pre- and post-incursion data (P = 0.90 and P = 0.83, respectively). Nevertheless, it is concluded that the presence of didymo has an effect on the base of the aquatic food web of the Matapedia River. This study is the first to assess the effect of this invasive alga on BMIs in Eastern Canada.

Four experimental treatments were used: CK, organic manure, mineral NPK fertilizer, and organic manure plus mineral fertilizer. The diversity of the nirS gene was analyzed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The Shannon diversity index and Evenness factor, Simpson's diversity and Shannon-Weiner indices, principal component analysis and a one-way analysis of similarities test showed that organic manure made the opposite contribution to soil diversity of nirS genes compared to mineral fertilizer treatment, which resulted in increased diversity of the nirS gene. Comparison of the phylogenetic analysis of nirS genes in the mineral fertilizer and organic manure clone libraries showed that induction by mineral fertilizer was stronger than that by organic manure, based on the types of unique nirS genotypes found in the two libraries and the evolutionary distances between them.

EFFECTS OF DATA CATEGORIZATION ON PALEOCOMMUNITY ANALYSIS: A CASE STUDY FROM THE PENNSYLVANIAN FINIS SHALE OF TEXAS								PALAIOS				25	3-4			144	157		10.2110/palo.2009.p09-011r			MAR-APR 2010	2010	Paleocommunity research efforts have explored a multitude of faunal assemblages using a wide range of sampling and analytical methods to infer a paleoecological signal. Here, we derive six secondary datasets from a single stratigraphic series of faunal assemblages in the Finis Shale (Pennsylvanian) of Jacksboro, Texas, USA, using a variety of data categorization decisions (i.e., abundance versus calcified biomass, all taxa versus selected indicator taxa, and generic versus higher clade resolution). Biomass- and abundance-derived datasets were not significantly different in terms of evenness, Shannon's information index, or Simpson's diversity index. Using Bray-Curtis and nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations, with Sorenson and relative Sorenson distance measures, ordination axis scores of the six derived datasets were all significantly correlated with one another, suggesting little difference in their respective paleoecological signals. Three potential explanations for this consistent paleoecological signal, regardless of which data categorizations are employed, include: (1) the dominance of a few brachiopod taxa overwhelmingly influenced the community structure, (2) relatively constrained environmental conditions limited community variation, and (3) low variation in specimen size minimized potential differences among abundance and calcified biomass categorizations. We suggest that other datasets with greater diversities, greater evenness, or from a wider range of paleoenvironments might not show this consistency. Thus, to the degree possible and appropriate, paleoecological investigators should test the effects of these data categorization decisions on a paleoecological signal, regardless of the analytical method employed.

J	Marenghi, Frank; Ozbay, Gulnihal; Erbland, Patrick; Rossi-Snook, Kate								A comparison of the habitat value of sub-tidal and floating oyster (Crassostrea virginica) aquaculture gear with a created reef in Delaware's Inland Bays, USA								AQUACULTURE INTERNATIONAL				18	1			69	81		10.1007/s10499-009-9273-3			FEB 2010	2010	The culture of the Eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) in containment gear has become a viable component of restoration programs in many states on the East Coast of the United States, and it has been suggested that these operations may provide many of the same ecological services as natural or restored reefs. Our two-part study comparing the diversity and abundance in macro-epifaunal communities associated with a sub-tidal-created oyster reef and 'modified rack and bag' cage system (Part I) and floating oyster cages for restoration (Part II) occurred over the summer and fall of 2006 and 2007, respectively. In Part I, a greater total abundance and species richness (P < 0.05) was found to be associated with the cages, but greater evenness (P < 0.05) was found on the reef. No significant difference (P > 0.05) was found in species diversity according to Simpson's index by habitat type, but it was significant (P < 0.05) by month. These samples were dominated by naked goby (Gobisoma bosc) and Atlantic mud crab (Panopeus herbstii). Spaghetti worm (Ampharetidae, P < 0.01), sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus, P < 0.01), blue crab (Callinectes sapidus, P < 0.01), grey snapper (Lutjanus griseus, P < 0.05), gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis, P < 0.01), and Atlantic oyster drill (Urosalpinx cinera, P < 0.05) were unique to the cages, while the skilletfish (Gobiesox strumosus) was unique to the reef. Part II revealed that the floating cages supported 13 species of fish and invertebrates, although no significant differences in species richness, evenness, or diversity were found by month or by bay area (P > 0.05). These results suggest that created reefs in conjunction with 'rack and bag' cage systems, as well as floating cage systems, support ecologically and economically important macro-epifauna, even at very small scales.

Timothy; Baraloto, Christopher; Thebaud, Christophe; Chave, Jerome								Shifts in species and phylogenetic diversity between sapling and tree communities indicate negative density dependence in a lowland rain forest								JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				98	1			137	146		10.1111/j.1365-2745.2009.01607.x			JAN 2010	2010	P>1. As trees in a given cohort progress through ontogeny, many individuals die. This risk of mortality is unevenly distributed across species because of many processes such as habitat filtering, interspecific competition and negative density dependence. Here, we predict and test the patterns that such ecological processes should inscribe on both species and phylogenetic diversity as plants recruit from saplings to the canopy. 2. We compared species and phylogenetic diversity of sapling and tree communities at two sites in French Guiana. We surveyed 2084 adult trees in four 1-ha tree plots and 943 saplings in sixteen 16-m2 subplots nested within the tree plots. Species diversity was measured using Fisher's alpha (species richness) and Simpson's index (species evenness). Phylogenetic diversity was measured using Faith's phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic richness) and Rao's quadratic entropy index (phylogenetic evenness). The phylogenetic diversity indices were inferred using four phylogenetic hypotheses: two based on rbcLa plastid DNA sequences obtained from the inventoried individuals with different branch lengths, a global phylogeny available from the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group, and a combination of both. 3. Taxonomic identification of the saplings was performed by combining morphological and DNA barcoding techniques using three plant DNA barcodes (psbA-trnH, rpoC1 and rbcLa). DNA barcoding enabled us to increase species assignment and to assign unidentified saplings to molecular operational taxonomic units. 4. Species richness was similar between saplings and trees, but in about half of our comparisons, species evenness was higher in trees than in saplings. This suggests that negative density dependence plays an important role during the sapling-to-tree transition. 5. Phylogenetic richness increased between saplings and trees in about half of the comparisons. Phylogenetic evenness increased significantly between saplings and trees in a few cases (4 out of 16) and only with the most resolved phylogeny. These results suggest that negative density dependence operates largely independently of the phylogenetic structure of communities. 6. Synthesis. By contrasting species richness and evenness across size classes, we suggest that negative density dependence drives shifts in composition during the sapling-to-tree transition. In addition, we found little evidence for a change in phylogenetic diversity across age classes, suggesting that the observed patterns are not phylogenetically constrained.

Conversion of sagebrush shrublands to exotic annual grasslands negatively impacts small mammal communities								DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS				15	5			863	870		10.1111/j.1472-4642.2009.00593.x			SEP 2009	2009	Aim The exotic annual cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum) is fast replacing sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) communities throughout the Great Basin Desert and nearby regions in the Western United States, impacting native plant communities and altering fire regimes, which contributes to the long-term persistence of this weedy species. The effect of this conversion on native faunal communities remains largely unexamined. We assess the impact of conversion from native perennial to exotic annual plant communities on desert rodent communities. Location Wyoming big sagebrush shrublands and nearby sites previously converted to cheatgrass-dominated annual grasslands in the Great Basin Desert, Utah, USA. Methods At two sites in Tooele County, Utah, USA, we investigated with Sherman live trapping whether intact sagebrush vegetation and nearby converted Bromus tectorum-dominated vegetation differed in rodent abundance, diversity and community composition. Results Rodent abundance and species richness were considerably greater in sagebrush plots than in cheatgrass-dominated plots. Nine species were captured in sagebrush plots; five of these were also trapped in cheatgrass plots, all at lower abundances than in the sagebrush. In contrast, cheatgrass-dominated plots had no species that were not found in sagebrush. In addition, the site that had been converted to cheatgrass longer had lower abundances of rodents than the site more recently converted to cheatgrass-dominated plots. Despite large differences in abundances and species richness, Simpson's D diversity and Shannon-Wiener diversity and Brillouin evenness indices did not differ between sagebrush and cheatgrass-dominated plots. Main conclusions This survey of rodent communities in native sagebrush and in converted cheatgrass-dominated vegetation suggests that the abundances and community composition of rodents may be shifting, potentially at the larger spatial scale of the entire Great Basin, where cheatgrass continues to invade and dominate more landscape at a rapid rate.

Assessing regional geodiversity: the Iberian Peninsula								EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS				34	10			1433	1445		10.1002/esp.1840			AUG 2009	2009	Geodiversity is a landscape characteristic related to the heterogeneity of the physical properties of the earth surface. in this work, we quantify and compare geodiversity in several geodynamic zones of the Iberian Peninsula. For this purpose, we have developed a geographic information system (GIS) procedure to carry out a regional terrain classification based on geodiversity factors. A classification process helped to produce a morphometric map (10 classes), a morphoclimatic map (five classes) and a geological map (15 classes). These three maps were combined using an overlay operation (union) to obtain the final terrain classification (419 classes), which was then applied to calculate diversity landscape indices. The latter were calculated using common landscape diversity indices (Patch Richness Density, Shannon's Diversity Index, Shannon's Evenness Index, Simpson's Diversity Index and Simpson's Evenness Index), provided by FRAGSTATS free software. These indices were calculated for the whole landscape of the main Iberian geological regions, thus revealing a close relationship between some index values and the geological and geomorphological characteristics. The highest diversity values are associated with Alpine collisional orogens and reactivated chains of the Precambrian-Palaeozoic massif. Intraplate orogen with sedimentary cover, characterized by extensive planation surfaces, have lower values. Mesozoic areas with no significant tectonic deformation and Cenozoic basins are characterized by the lowest diversity values. Amongst the latter, the major diversity is associated with the most dissected basins, which also present higher morphoclimatic variety. Though depending on the chosen scale and the landscape classification criteria, these indices provide an objective assessment of the regional geodiversity of Iberia.

The comparison, based on 30 quadrats 1 m(2) at each of two sites, revealed less than 25% similarity in the vegetation cover of the two sites. The successional alvar shrubland that developed following fire had twice as many species and more regionally rare species than the corresponding woodland site. The shrubland also had higher values for various biodiversity measures that take heterogeneity and evenness into account. These data provide additional evidence for the importance of fire and disturbance in the creation of successional habitat upon which biodiversity depends. A cautious use of fire in management of elvers is supported.

One of the most successful invasive species is Bromus tectorum L. (cheatgrass), which is having marked impacts on native plant communities and ecosystem processes. However; we know little about the effects of this invasion on native animal species in the Intermountain West. Because ants have been used to detect ecological change associated with anthropogenic land use, they seem well suited for a preliminary evaluation of the consequences of cheatgrass-driven habitat conversion. In our study, we used pitfall traps to assess ant community assemblages in intact sagebrush and nearby cheatgrass-dominated vegetation. Ant abundance was about 10-fold greater in cheatgrass-dominated plots than in sagebrush Plots. We also noted differences in diversity and evenness between habitat types at both the species and the functional-group levels of organization. At the species level, Shannon's diversity index was greater in sagebrush plots than in cheatgrass-dominated Plots. However, at the functional-group level, Simpson's and Shannon's diversity indices and the Brillouin evenness index were greater in cheatgrass-dominated plots than in sagebrush plots. Further, common species/functional groups tended to be more abundant while less common species/functional groups tended to be less abundant in cheatgrass-dominated plots compared to intact sagebrush plots. Patterns appear to be at least partially related to resource availabilities. This initial survey of ant communities front intact-native and altered vegetation types may be indicative of similar trends of biodiversity shifts throughout the Intermountain West where cheatgrass has successfully replaced native species. We also discuss the implications of ant communities on land management activities, specifically in the context of aridland restoration.

Negative <i>per capita</i> effects of two invasive plants, <i>Lythrum salicaria</i> and <i>Phalaris arundinacea</i>, on the moth diversity of wetland communities								BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH				99	3			229	243		10.1017/S0007485308006251			JUN 2009	2009	Invasive plants have been shown to negatively affect the diversity of plant communities. However, little is known about the effect of invasive plants on the diversity at other trophic levels. In this study, we examine the per capita effects of two invasive plants, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), on moth diversity in wetland communities at 20 sites in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Prior studies document that increasing abundance of these two plant species decreases the diversity of plant communities. We predicted that this reduction in plant diversity would result in reduced herbivore diversity. Four measurements were used to quantify diversity: species richness (S), community evenness (J), Brillouin's index (H) and Simpson's index (D). We identified 162 plant species and 156 moth species across the 20 wetland sites. The number of moth species was positively correlated with the number of plant species. In addition, invasive plant abundance was negatively correlated with species richness of the moth community (linear relationship), and the effect was similar for both invasive plant species. However, no relationship was found between invasive plant abundance and the three other measures of moth diversity (J, H, D) which included moth abundance in their calculation. We conclude that species richness within, and among, trophic levels is adversely affected by these two invasive wetland plant species.		[Schooler, S.

Total predatory Heteroptera were most abundant in St. Augustinegrass and zoysiagrass and included Anthocoridae, Lasiochilidae, Geocoridae, and Miridae. Anthocoridae and Lasiochilidae were most common in St. Augustinegrass, and their abundance correlated positively with species of Blissidae and Delphacidae. Chinch bugs were present in all turf taxa, but were 23-47 times more abundant in St. Augustinegrass. Anthocorids/lasiochilids were more numerous on taller grasses, as were Blissidae, Delphacidae, Cicadellidae and Cercopidae. Geocoridae and Miridae were most common in zoysiagrass and were collected in higher numbers with increasing weed density. However, no predatory Heteroptera were affected by grass density. Other beneficial insects such as staphylinids and parasitic Hymenoptera were captured most often in St. Augustinegrass and zoysiagrass. These differences in abundance could be in response to primary or alternate prey, or reflect the influence of turf microenvironmental characteristics. In this study, Simpson's diversity index for predatory Heteroptera showed the greatest diversity and evenness in centipedegrass, whereas the herbivores and detritivores were most diverse in St. Augustinegrass lawns. These results demonstrate the complex role of plant taxa in structuring arthropod communities in turf. An increased understanding of how turf species and cultivars help shape pest and beneficial arthropod communities will enhance predictive abilities and further pest management objectives.

With increasing emphasis on reducing pesticide inputs in agricultural production, alternative management technologies are now being used including transgenic silage corn modified to express Cry1Ab protein toxins derived from Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Berliner. The Cry1Ab toxin is expressed by all plant cells and throughout the growing season. Furthermore, the toxins are exuded from corn plant roots into the rhizosphere, raising concerns over possible side-effects on non-target beneficial organisms in the same habitat. In addition, detrivores are exposed to crop residues containing the toxin when incorporated into the soil. The current 2-year study (2003, 2004) evaluated effects of two silage-corn varieties: Pioneer var. 38A25 (Bt-corn expressing the Cry1Ab toxin) and Pioneer var. 38A24 (parent isoline) on species diversity and evenness of carabid beetles and Collembola. Pitfall traps were used to collect surface-dwelling species on a bimonthly schedule from April to October. Soil cores were taken once a month from April to October to sample subterranean species, which were extracted using Berlese funnels. All individuals were recorded and identified where possible to species level for analysis in the Simpson's D and Shannon-Wiener H' diversity indices. Evenness was measured using Simpson's E', after which dominant species were analyzed in a multivariate ordination analysis. Results showed Bt-corn had no negative effects on any of the organisms analyzed. There was a significant year effect on the abundance of surface-dwelling Collembola and on species diversity of soil-dwelling Collembola. Our findings suggest that crop management practices and/or environmental conditions (e.g., heavy rainfall during the 2004 growing season) had the greatest impact on species diversity and evenness, rather than the crop itself (Bt or isoline).

To study fungal biodiversity in the air, a 7-day recording Hirst-type spore trap was used. The daily concentration of 124 taxa was recorded in an Italian vineyard. The predominant fungi were: Cladosporium spp., unknown 3-septate fusiform spore, and Alternaria spp. Shannon's and Simpson's biodiversity indices and evenness were calculated first for air spora. Meteorological circumstances affected the biodiversity; positive correlations were found between Simpson's biodiversity index and precipitation, but no significant correlations were found with Shannon's diversity index and evenness. To predict Simpson's index for airborne fungi, regression analysis was performed. It was shown that the best estimator, sun hours, negatively affected the index. The biodiversity of the dominant species was low on dry days, since Cladosporium alone had much higher abundance on such days than other species.

Response of soil invertebrates to disturbance across three resource regions in North Carolina								ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT				152	1-4			283	298		10.1007/s10661-008-0315-5			MAY 2009	2009	We evaluated the potential of soil microarthropods and enchytraeid worms to be useful as bioindicators of soil condition in forest, wetland, and agricultural ecosystems over a range of ecoregions. Selected mesofauna and soil characteristics in soil and litter in relatively undisturbed and disturbed examples of each of three ecosystems within each of three land resource regions were monitored over two years. Optimal times of year to sample these organisms as indicators of disturbance were April, May, July and September. No single measure reflected disturbance across all three ecosystems. Among forest sites, Simpson's diversity index, evenness, abundance of ants, and proportion of enchytraeids in the mesofauna differed between soils of different disturbance levels. Among agricultural sites, richness, evenness, abundance of mites, and proportions of collembolans and of enchytraeids in the mesofauna differed between disturbance levels. Among wetland sites, Shannon's and Simpson's diversity indices, richness based on the total mesofauna, and abundances of mites, diplurans, ants, and isotomid and onychiurid collembolans differed between disturbance levels. Covariates most frequently associated with abundance and diversity of the measured mesofauna were soil electrical conductivity, available N, organic matter, and pH. Canonical correspondence analysis provided information somewhat different to bivariate analysis. Using both approaches to examine soil and litter taxa that have distinctive responses to disturbance may help to identify candidate groups applicable for use in large-scale environmental monitoring programs.

Circulating entomofaune in orchards of apple trees in the region of the Aures (Eastern - Algeria)								AFRICAN JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH				4	3			178	186					MAR 2009	2009	In the Aures Area (Eastern Algeria), the protection of apple trees orchards against pests is essentially based on massive use of chemicals. To evaluate its impact on beneficial, a study of the entomologic biodiversity, evaluated through its regularity at the families scale has been carried out and a description of the beneficial fauna has been realised. Sampling procedures was achieved by bimonthly beating from April to October 2003 and by mowing of the inter-raw in spring and in the beginning of summer. A convergence between the result issued from the beating and the mowing of the inter-raw is noticed as for the effectives, and then superior biomass for the orchard 1 of Fesdis. An entomological wealth increased of some functional groups (Coccinellidae, Syrphidae, predator bugs and Forficulidae) in the herbaceous cover of this orchard's inter-raw, is not accompanied by insects stocking richer of apple tree due to the factor of high aphid effectives. The diversity index H, of Species Evenness Index E (weak values), Simpson's diversity index D (high value) calculated for the stocking of apple tree of orchard 1; interpret this group abundance and don't permit to characterize this orchard. The observed differences between the three orchards can be related to the production mode (Organic substance supply and mechanical maintenance of the raw for the orchard of Fesdis) and to the chemical protection (orchards of Bouhmama and Ichemoul) and are in relation to the structure of the beneficial fauna.

Zoosymposia				2				457	485					2009	2009	We used data sets from two Arctic shelves to examine relationships between primary production (or a proxy), ice cover, and the diversity of polychaetes. Benthic samples were collected from the Northeast Water Polynya on the Northeast Greenland shelf and from the Barents Sea. Each of these areas is characterized by large differences in seasonal ice cover and primary production on a mesoscale. In addition to enumerating polychaete diversity, we also quantified the concentration of benthic algal pigments, sediment percent organic carbon, ice cover for the four years preceding sampling, and sediment grain size. In the Barents Sea, primary production was estimated from an ecosystem model. In both northeast Greenland and the Barents Sea, locations with lower primary production (Barents Sea) or proxies for primary production (benthic algal pigments: Greenland and Barents Sea), exhibited the greatest taxonomic richness. In Greenland, the area with the lowest concentration of benthic pigments had an ES(201) up to 30% higher than values from areas with four times more pigments. In the Barents Sea, ES(201) was greatest in the North under heaviest ice cover (>25% cover per year), again approximately 30% higher than in the South (<15% cover) or under the Polar Front (15-25% cover). Other factors also explained diversity: multiple regressions and Principal Component Analysis indicated that grain size, water depth and concentration of sediment organic carbon were important predictors of species diversity (Shannon-Wiener Index and Simpson's Reciprocal Index), but the results of these analyses were occasionally different from the patterns observed in the species accumulation curves or ES(201) values. Simpson's Index indicated that high ice-cover (and low primary production and benthic pigment) areas in the Barents Sea had greater evenness (lower dominance) than regions with higher indicators of food supply to the benthos. Low resource levels may prevent a few species from becoming very abundant and out-competing rare species. Diversity indices from northeast Greenland did not vary significantly among regions. We did not address habitat heterogeneity, but patchy distribution of food, combined with small-scale sediment heterogeneity also could enhance richness in food-poor areas. While the mechanism for the relationship between polychaete species richness and ice concentration or primary production is not clear, it does suggest that a change in polychaete diversity may need to be added to the list of possible responses of the benthos to climate-driven changes in ice cover.

Diversity of organisms, measurement of variety and examination of those hypotheses that are about reasons of diversity are such as affairs that have been desired by the ecologists for a long time. In this research, diversity of plant species in forest region, numbers of 60 sample plots in 256.00 square meters have been considered in random systematic inventory was considered. In each sample plot, four micro-plots in 2.25 square meters in order to study on herbal cover, were executed that totally 240 micro-plots were considered. At each plot six diversity indices in relation to physiographic factors (slope, geographical aspect and altitude from the sea level) were studied. The results indicate that species diversity is more in the northern direction and also species diversity in slops less than 30% has the most amounts. Factor of altitude from the sea level did not have meaningful relation with species diversity. Through study on correlation of the numbers of species in sample plots with indices and also process and role of indices in different processors of analysis, Simpson's reciprocal index was suggested as suitable index in this type of studies.

Ant species richness and evenness increase along a metal pollution gradient in the Boleslaw zinc smelter area								PEDOBIOLOGIA				53	1			65	73		10.1016/j.pedobi.2009.03.002			2009	2009	Ants are considered to be relatively resistant to metal pollution, but the effect of metal toxicity on ant communities is poorly understood. This work examined the relationship between ant species diversity and heavy metal pollution at 16 meadow and forest sites along a metal contamination gradient in a mining and smelting region near Olkusz, Poland. Menhinick's index was used to estimate species richness. Pielou's index of evenness (J), Simpson's index of diversity (D) and the slopes of rank-abundance curves were used to estimate of species evenness. Regardless of species composition differences between forest and meadow, the increase in species diversity with increasing metal. pollution was very clear in both ecosystems. The more polluted the site, the more species were detected and the more similar in relative abundance they were. Consequently, the extent to which one or a few species dominated a community decreased. This result can be explained by indirect effects of metal pollution, that is, changes in species interactions rather than by changes in abiotic conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

The relationship between productivity and multiple aspects of biodiversity in six grassland communities								BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				18	1			91	104		10.1007/s10531-008-9457-6			JAN 2009	2009	Biodiversity is a multifaceted concept but most studies examining the association between the biodiversity of a community and its productivity focus only on species richness. Consequently, studies are needed to examine how other facets of biodiversity vary with productivity if we want to have a better understanding of the distribution of biodiversity across our planet. We evaluated how a number of biodiversity measures (species richness, evenness, dominance, rarity, Simpson's diversity, and Shannon-Weiner diversity) varied across natural productivity gradients at 6 grassland sites in the continental US. Variation in productivity did not account for a substantial amount of variation in any measure of biodiversity at small spatial scales (a parts per thousand 1 m(2)) at most sites. When productivity accounted for substantial variation in biodiversity, different measures of biodiversity responded to productivity in different ways. For example, dominance changed in a U-shaped fashion along a productivity gradient whereas richness increased in an asymptotic fashion. Consequently, diversity indices, which account for both species richness and evenness, varied in a hump-shaped fashion along the productivity gradient. Our results highlight that an exclusive focus on the association between species richness and productivity provides an incomplete picture of how a community's biodiversity is related to its functioning.

Tree species composition and diversity of tropical mountain cloud forest in the Yunnan, southwestern China								ECOLOGICAL RESEARCH				24	1			83	92		10.1007/s11284-008-0484-2			JAN 2009	2009	Species composition, physiognomy, and plant diversity of the less known cloud forests in Yunnan were studied based on data collected from 35 sample plots at seven sites. In floristic composition, the cloud forests are mainly comprised of Fagaceae, Ericaceae, Vacciniaceae, Aceraceae, Magnoliaceae, Theaceae, Aquifoliaceae, Illiciaceae, Lauraceae, and Rosaceae. Physiognomically, the forests are dominated by tree and shrub species. Lianas are rare in the forests. The plants with microphyllous or nanophyllous leaves comprise 44.32-63.46% of the total species, and plants with an entire leaf margin account for more than 50% of the tree and shrub species. There are few tree and shrub species with a drip tip leaf apex and papery leaves. Evergreen species make up more than 75% of the total tree and shrub species. In a 2,500 m(2) sampling area, the number of vascular species ranged between 57 and 110; Simpson's diversity index ranged from 0.7719 to 0.9544, Shannon-Winner's diversity index from 1.8251 to 3.2905, and Pielou's evenness index from 0.5836 to 0.8982 for trees. The cloud forests in Yunnan are physiognomically similar to the tropical cloud forests in America and Southeast Asia. They very much resemble the mountain dwarf mossy forest in Hainan Island, southeastern China, and the Mountain ericaceous forests in the Malay Peninsula. The cloud forests in Yunnan are considered to be developed, as are the tropical upper montane cloud forests in Asia.		[Shi, J.

This paper analyzes the effect of the cushion plants on the community diversity at 4650 in on the eastern slope of the Iliniza volcano in Ecuador. Ninety sample plots of 1 m(2) size were located in the study area and were divided into 25 subplots in which presence and abundance of plant species was recorded. The community diversity was expressed as species richness, Simpson's diversity index, and evenness. Correlation between the cushion species and the composition of the colonists was measured with the CCA ordination analysis, correlation between the cushion cover and community diversity was measured by means of correlation analysis. Randomized species-area curves were used to compare richness of plant communities with and without the cushions. A total of 32 species were found including five cushion plants. Most species preferred to grow on the cushion surface whereas only a few species were able to colonize open ground. Species richness and Simpson's index were significantly correlated to the cushion area but no correlation was found for evenness. The cushions were usually composed of more than one species which hampered the examination of the cushion-colonist specific relationships. Nevertheless, cushions of Azorella and Arenaria seemed to provide more favorable habitat for colonization than the other cushion species. Comparison with an earlier study made on Iliniza indicates that the presence of the cushions significantly increases the richness of the plant community. (C) 2008 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

In this study we evaluated how levels of heavy metal contamination can be reflected in the macro invertebrate communities of six Tagus Estuary mudflats, inferring their consequences to upper trophic levels. We used Shannon-Wiener's diversity, Pielou's evenness and Simpson's dominance indices, and macroinvertebrate densities to characterize benthic Communities at the sites that presented different metal contamination loads. Those stations with high levels of contamination presented a lower diversity but also the highest prey density. This study indicated that unhealthy areas can still perform their ecosystem function with costs that remain to be evaluated. The biodiversity can be impoverished compared with other less contaminated sites, but with regard to their utilization as feeding areas by birds and fishes this is not a limiting factor. For this particular function of the mudflats, prey availability is the main characteristic determining the choice of one particular site as a bird and fish feeding area that may not be affected by heavy metal contamination.

Species diversity indices were 2.735 (Shannon-Wiener), 0.88 (Simpson's) and 0.296 (Evenness). There was a strong evidence of disturbance arising from anthropogenic and wildlife foraging activities. This inventory has affirmed Mt. Marsabit forest as a unique habitat for several endemic, rare, threatened or vulnerable plant species, which should be conserved.

Comparison of rhizosphere bacterial communities in <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> mutants for systemic acquired resistance								MICROBIAL ECOLOGY				55	2			333	343		10.1007/s00248-007-9279-1			FEB 2008	2008	Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is an inducible systemic plant defense against a broad spectrum of plant pathogens, with the potential to secrete antimicrobial compounds into the soil. However, its impact on rhizosphere bacteria is not known. In this study, we examined fingerprints of bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to determine the effect of SAR on bacterial community structure and diversity. We compared Arabidopsis mutants that are constitutive and non-inducible for SAR and verified SAR activation by measuring pathogenesis-related protein activity via a beta-glucoronidase (GUS) reporter construct driven by the beta-1-3 glucanase promoter. We used terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of MspI- and HaeIII-digested 16S rDNA to estimate bacterial rhizosphere community diversity, with Lactobacillus sp. added as internal controls. T-RFLP analysis showed a clear rhizosphere effect on community structure, and diversity analysis of both rhizosphere and bulk soil operational taxonomic units (as defined by terminal restriction fragments) using richness, Shannon-Weiner, and Simpson's diversity indices and evenness confirmed that the presence of Arabidopsis roots significantly altered bacterial communities. This effect of altered soil microbial community structure by plants was also seen upon multivariate cluster analysis of the terminal restriction fragments. We also found visible differences in the rhizosphere community fingerprints of different Arabidopsis SAR mutants; however, there was no clear decrease of rhizosphere diversity because of constitutive SAR expression. Our study suggests that SAR can alter rhizosphere bacterial communities, opening the door to further understanding and application of inducible plant defense as a driving force in structuring soil bacterial assemblages.

Study on woody species diversity in the chestnut Castanea sativa L.) forests, Guilan, Iran								AIP Conference Proceedings				971				264	+					2008	2008	The purpose of this research was to study diversity of woody species in the Sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa L.) forests, Guilan, north of Iran. These forests are located in the Shafaroud and Emamzadeh Ebrahim. regions. The Emamzadeh Ebrahim region is consisted of Visroud, Kishkhaleh, Askeh Koh, Male Lab, Doroudkhan, Galeroudkhan, Siahmazgy and Mali Anbar sites. Sampling was done in a selective manner in each site with a plot area of 50 in x 50 in for tree and shrub layers and a circle 1000 m(2) for tree saplings. In each plot, all trees ! 10 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH) were identified and the DBH was measured, and shrub and tree sapling species were identified and recorded. In total, 68 sampling plots were taken using GPS device in the two regions. The results revealed that the mean richness, Simpson's index, Hill's N-2, Shannon Wiener's function and N-1 were higher in the Shafaroud region than other sites in tree, shrub and tree sapling layers. The highest and lowest mean values of evenness were obtained in the Kishkhaleh and Askekoh sites, respectively in tree layer, and similarly were in the Askekoh and Visroud in the shrub layer. The highest and lowest mean values of evenness were obtained in the Male Lab and Askeh Koh, respectively in the tree sapling layer.

J	Ortega-Huerta, Miguel Alfonso; Kral, Karla Kae								Relating biodiversity and landscape spatial patterning to land ownership regimes in northeastern Mexico								ECOLOGY AND SOCIETY				12	2					12				DEC 2007	2007	Land legislation has changed dramatically in Mexico during recent years, putting greater emphasis on the integration of free market policies into local production methods. In a country like Mexico, replacement of traditional methods of production may result in the loss of practices that protect the natural environment. With the objective of providing baseline information for future conservation and/or land management programs, I evaluated how landscape patterning and the richness of bird and mammal species varied among current land ownership sizes and types, applying a stratified scheme that controlled for potential variation among different physiographic regions. I characterized landscape spatial patterning using the aggregation index, Shannon's Diversity Index, and the Modified Simpson's Evenness index, and I used the GARP modeling approach to estimate species richness within each land ownership regime. Particular attention was paid to variation among community-based vs. individually based ownership types. A notable finding with regard to parcel size is that there is a general pattern in which medium-to-large parcels contained greater percentages of natural vegetation; this relationship is less consistent for the largest parcels. Regarding land ownership types, community-based lands generally presented higher estimates of habitat conservation, i.e., a higher percentage of natural vegetation, higher aggregation, and more even distribution of land cover types, and a greater richness of bird and mammal species. These results suggest that attention should be paid to evaluating the importance of different types of land ownership in determining spatial patterns of biodiversity. Furthermore, these initial assessments, of how landscape structure and species richness varies across land ownership regimes, serve as reference points for future evaluations of change in landscape and biodiversity spatial patterns in Mexico.

Genetic diversity (pi) and four other diversity indices (Simpson's unbiased, Shannon-Wiener, Evenness, and Chao1 indices) were applied to estimate the adaptive lineages of microorganisms in the mangrove ecosystem. The results indicated that gamma-Proteobacteria is the most diverse taxon, while the most abundant family is Rhodobacteraceae (alpha-Proteobacteria), followed by Comamonadaceae (beta-Proteobacteria). This result may imply the existence of a graded distribution of microbial diversity across a spectrum of different salinities in the waterbody of this estuary ecosystem. Furthermore, at least 500-1,000 bps of the posterior portion of 16S rDNA is required as a marker to profile the microbial diversity in a microcosm of interest using phylogenetic methods, according to the results of our sliding window analyses for the measurements of pi, consistency index, and retention index.

Tree-level diversity tested using a new method								BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				16	10			2933	2948		10.1007/s10531-007-9151-0			SEP 2007	2007	Concern about forestry practices creating tree-level monoculture plantations exists. Our study investigates tree diversity responses for six early seral boreal forest plantations in Ontario, Canada, representing three conifer species; black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (P. glauca), and jack pine (Pinus banksiana), 14 release treatments, and 94 experimental units. Dominance-diversity curves and Simpson's indices of diversity and evenness indicate tree alpha diversity. We propose a new method for assessing diversity, using percentage of theoretical species maximum (%TSM) which is determined by comparing post-disturbance richness (S) with a theoretical species maximum (TSM). Our results support the hypothesis that alternative vegetation release treatments generally do not reduce tree species diversity levels (%TSM) relative to untreated plots. The only %TSM (P <= 0.05) comparison that produced less diversity than in control plots was repeated annual treatments of Vision herbicide at one of the black spruce study sites. Our results generally support the hypothesis that tree monocultures do not develop after vegetation release. Only one out of 94 experimental units developed into a tree layer monoculture (Simpson's reciprocal diversity index = 1). Again this was one of the repeated annual treatments of Vision herbicide at one of the black spruce study sites-a treatment which is atypical of Canadian forest management.

The structure of species diversity was investigated through the simultaneous analysis of indices relating to 4 diversity components: (1) the number of species (species density S and Margalef's D-mg index), (2) rarity (number of species with less than 5% of occurrence), (3) evenness (Heip's E-Heip and Berger-Parker's 1/d indices) and (4) taxonomic diversity (Delta, Delta*, Delta(+), Delta(+)). In addition, two popular heterogeneous indices (Simpson's 1 - D and Shannon's H' indices) combining the number of species and evenness were also considered. PCA based on Spearman's correlation coefficients was carried out to investigate empirical relationships between these 11 indices while genecalized linear models (GLMs) were used to analyse diversity patterns in relation to bathymetry. Our results showed that the 11 species diversity indices studied might be grouped into 6 complementary components: (1) number of species (species density S and Margalef's D-mg index), (2) evenness (E-Heip, 1/d, H', 1 - D, Delta), (3) rarity and each of the 3 other measures of taxonomy: (4) Delta*, (5) Delta(+), and (6) Lambda(+). This result showed not only that a single diversity index cannot provide a complete description of species diversity but also that - in some cases - it cannot even encapsulate a complete description of a specific diversity component. In addition, in contrast to their expected theoretical properties, some descriptors appeared to be redundant in our field study. Finally, we found that the influence ofdepth on diversity patterns is usually significant but weak and varies according to the diversity components considered. Our findings - which show that diversity descriptors may respond in different ways to habitat degradation or loss - highlight the complexity of defining priority areas of protection taking simultaneously into account the main characteristics of diversity.

The fish were identified and enumerated, and tissue contaminants (in fillets), and external abnormalities (body, buccal, branchial, and ocular) were determined. Results were compared for sites east and weft of the Mississippi River, within the Mississippi River, seven estuarine categories, and over 3 years. Approximately 31,000 individual fish were captured, representing 100 genera and 141 species. Thirteen species comprised 91 % of the total abundance; abundances of 128 species were 1% or less. Pinfish Lagodon rhomboides, Atlantic croaker Micropogonias undulatus, Gulf menhaden Brevoortia patronus, and bay anchovy Anchoa mitchilli were the more dominant species. Fourteen species were collected from at least 10% of the sites; 85 species were captured at no more than 1% of the sites. Atlantic croakers and hardhead catfish Ariopsis felis were collected more frequently (>50% of sites). Indices of community structure from the full data set ranged as follows: 2.8 for the Shannon-Wiener index, 0.90 for Simpson's index, and 0.56 for Pielou's evenness index. Chemical contaminants (predominantly total mercury and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]) exceeded federal risk-based consumption guidelines in 2.7% of fillets from four species. External abnormalities occurred on 17 species and approximately 1% of the total number of fish examined. Community structural properties varied temporally across years and spatially over estuarine categories and between areas east and west of the Mississippi River. Four distinct assemblages were identified by cluster analysis of species abundance. Cluster membership was associated with salinity, depth, dissolved oxygen, water clarity, and geographic area.

A total of 430 individuals under seven genera (Amietophrynus, Hemisus, Hyperolius, Phrynobatrachus, Phrynomantis, Ptychadena, Xenopus) comprising eleven species were sampled in three different habitats (apart from this, two additional species are known from Meru National Park): Acacia-wooded grassland; Combretum-wooded grassland; Acacia-Commiphora bushland. The sex ratio for almost all species was balanced (chi-square, chi(2); P > 0.5) and was not affected by habitat type (ANOVA: F = 8.3026, P = 0.6914). Shannon-Weaver Index (2.227) and Simpson's Index (8.244) were relatively high, and most of the eleven species sampled appeared to have a relatively even distribution (Shannon's Evenness Index, E = 0.927). However, Hemisus marmoratus and Phrynomantis bifasciatus were exclusively recorded in Acacia-wooded grassland and in low abundances. There was a positive linear relationship of body weight against snout-vent length for two randomly selected anurans (Hyperolius glandicolor, Phrynobatrachus natalensis) among all three vegetation communities.

For each sample, total DNA was extracted and 16S rDNA clone library were constructed. 442 clones were sequenced and analyzed. Using these clones, diversity was estimated not only in terms of species richness (nonparametric estimators) and evenness (Reciprocal of Simpson's index), but also in terms of phylogenetic diversity (LIBSHUFF program). Statistically significant differences were detected in phylogenetic composition between mine spoils and natural soil (p = 0.001), between revegetated soils and natural soil (p = 0.001), and between revegetated soils and mine spoils (P = 0.001). On the other hand, no significant differences in species richness were observed between the different environmental samples. These findings provide insights into the response of bacterial community following environmental perturbations caused by nickel-mining activities and revegetation efforts.

The present study records for the first time the aspects of zooplankton diversity in relation to physico-chemical environment of five selected sites of the East Calcutta wetlands, a Ramsar site of Kolkata city, India, heavily contaminated by industrial and municipal wastewaters. The study revealed the occurrence of 22 species of zooplankton, among these 3 species of Cladocera, 2 species of Copepoda, 15 species of Rotifera, and 2 species of Ostracoda were recorded. The copepod Mesocyclops leuckarti was found in all the five sites, rotifers Asplanchna brightwelli, Brachionus angularis, B. calyciflorus and Cladocera Ceriodaphnia cornuta were found in four sites; Moina micrura and Diaphanosoma sarsi were found at three sites. Site wise variation in dominance, diversity, evenness and richness were calculated. Site 1, a fish-pond that stabilized composite wastewater, showed the maximum species richness having 17 species, while Site 2, SWF wastewater carrying canal, showed only 4 species. The calculated Jack 1 values of Sites 1 to 5 were 21.78, 3.77, 18.63, 12.5 and 16.95 respectively. Shannon-Wiener species diversity index (HI) values were almost similar for all the three relatively less polluted sites viz, Site 1 (1.959), Site 4 (2.010), Site 5 (2.047). However, at highly polluted sites viz., 2 and 3, H-1 value of 1.336 and 0.984 respectively, were calculated. Simpson's Dominance index (D-simp) value was highest at Site 3(0.618) indicating maximum dominance, whereas at Site 5 dominance was lowest (0.1680) and diversity was highest.

LANDSCAPE CHARACTERISTICS OF SAGEBRUSH-STEPPE/JUNIPER WOODLAND MOSAICS UNDER VARIOUS MODELED PRESCRIBED FIRE REGIMES								Tall Timbers Fire Ecology Conference Proceedings					23			50	57					2007	2007	Juniper (Juniperus spp.) encroachment into adjacent vegetation has been identified as an ecological and management issue for juniper woodlands. This encroachment has resulted in numerous site- and landscape-level ecosystem changes, such as reduced herbaceous biomass production, altered watershed characteristics, reduced site and landscape diversity, and increased soil erosion. The cause of the encroachment includes direct and indirect fire suppression, livestock grazing, and climatic change. Regardless of cause, the use of prescribed fire has been proposed in many ecosystems as a management technique to address juniper encroachment. The effects of prescribed burning programs on the characteristics of juniper woodland-dominated landscapes and their ability to meet long-term ecological and management objectives have not previously been assessed. Three 6th-order watersheds were selected on the Owyhee Plateau, Idaho, because of the availability of prescribed fire effects data and other supporting data. The watersheds were classified into potential vegetation types and the area of each was classified into current successional stages utilizing Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) and digital elevation model data. Landscape dynamics under four different prescribed fire regimes were modeled for each watershed with the Tool for Exploratory Landscape Scenario Analyses (TELSA). The fire regimes studied were prescribed burning levels affecting 0, 2, 5, and 7% of each watershed's area per decade. Ten simulations of the predicted landscape composition for each watershed under each fire regime were analyzed using FRAGSTATS. Our results suggest that encroachment of western juniper (J. occidentalis ssp. occidentalis) is likely to continue into the future if no fire or even limited prescribed burning were implemented. Continued encroachment of western juniper is predicted to result in decreased landscape diversity. While the overall mean patch size within the landscapes decreased, mean patch size of juniper-dominated patches increased. This increase, together with decreases in Simpson's evenness indices, indicate a continued successional trajectory of simplification of watershed composition. Prescribed fire can be utilized to maintain landscape diversity or at least minimize the loss of diversity. Fire occurrence on at least 5% of the watersheds per decade will be required to maintain sagebrush-steppe vegetation at current levels.

Abundance, as percent cover, and several diversity indices were used to evaluate the distribution of these lichens among urban and non-urban (both rural and suburban) sites. The measures of diversity examined in this study include species richness, the Shannon-Wiener index, evenness, Simpson's index and the Index of Atmospheric Purity (IAP). A significant difference in abundance and diversity among the eleven study sites was established. This significance was maintained when the sites were grouped into urban vs. non-urban classes. It was found that the diversity of the epiphytic lichens examined in this study was associated with tree species, tree size and annual vehicle traffic, but not with human population density of the study site, or side of the tree observed (cardinal direction). Finally a comparative review was performed of epiphytic urban lichens as reported in a sampling of published surveys from North America.

Mean diversity levels were low during the postmonsoon period ( November) when there is heavy rainfall followed by the diluting effects of the river systems of the area; however, levels were high during the premonsoon season ( March and May) due to prevalence of marine conditions in the lake. Furthermore, the evaluation of different sectors in the study area showed somewhat poor diversity within the lagoon and rich diversity in the outer channel, the fauna of which was similar to the nearshore foraminiferids of Bay of Bengal. The spatial pattern of species diversity was predictable and was related to environmental features of the areas in the lake. Regarding the spatial community structure, outer channel showed highly stable environment due to its proximity to the sea whereas northern sector showed highly fluctuating environment being away from the oceanic region and highly affected by variations in the salinity. Seasonal comparison showed postmonsoon season as the most consistent period, whereas early premonsoon was the least consistent period. Bray-Curtis group linkage cluster analysis showed that none of the clusters of foraminiferal species present during post-monsoon occurred during pre-monsoon. In contrast to this observation, approximately 30% of the species were always clustered together during early premonsoon and late premonsoon, indicating the possibility of succession of species during November. An interesting observation was that a species replacement takes place in the case of foraminiferal fauna over a seasonal cycle. This finding could be an indication of the seasonality of this community through species succession.		Natl Inst Oceanog, Reg Ctr, Cochin 682014, Kerala, India; [Jayalakshmy, K.

Additive partitioning of diversity across hierarchical spatial scales in a forested landscape								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY				43	4			792	801		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01178.x			AUG 2006	2006	1. Ecological phenomena exist at multiple scales, but measurements of diversity frequently consider only the smallest scale, that of the original sample plots. Additive partitioning of diversity allows multiple, hierarchical spatial scales of analysis to reveal the scale at which diversity is maximized. 2. We examined the spatial partitioning of diversity across 378 permanent plots established in 10 7-369-ha research natural areas (RNA) in the 294 455-ha Shawnee National Forest, Illinois, USA. Diversity (richness and Shannon's and Simpson's indices) was partitioned across four spatial scales, i.e. within and between plots, and between RNA and natural divisions (corresponding to alpha and three levels of beta diversity), for two strata of vegetation (trees and woody understorey). 3. For both strata, the highest contribution to diversity measured as species richness was between plots and between RNA. Diversity was lower than expected within plots, although Simpson's and Shannon's indices achieved their maximum values at this scale. However, Shannon's index values were higher than Simpson's index values at the between-RNA scale and for all strata, indicating that the most common species were found at this scale. 4. There was a simple asymptotic relationship between plot occupancy and local abundance, suggesting high colonization rates and rapid colonization of open habitat indicative of a wide niche breadth of the most abundant species. 5. Synthesis and applications. The implications of these findings are that maximum diversity across a forested landscape is not necessarily at the scale of sampling (i.e. within plots) but may be at higher scales corresponding to larger landscape units. Moreover, the largest contribution of richness to total diversity occurred at a larger scale than diversity expressed using measures based upon information theory, which incorporate species abundance and evenness. Conservation efforts seeking to preserve diversity must identify and target the correct scales to allow effective management. In this study, management at and within the RNA represents the most appropriate scale for conserving maximum diversity.

Negative per capita effects of purple loosestrife and reed canary grass on plant diversity of wetland communities								DIVERSITY AND DISTRIBUTIONS				12	4			351	363		10.1111/j.1366-9516.2006.00227.x			JUL 2006	2006	Invasive plants can simplify plant community structure, alter ecosystem processes and undermine the ecosystem services that we derive from biotic diversity. Two invasive plants, purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and reed canary grass (Phalaris arundinacea), are becoming the dominant species in many wetlands across temperate North America. We used a horizontal, observational study to estimate per capita effects (PCEs) of purple loosestrife and reed canary grass on plant diversity in 24 wetland communities in the Pacific Northwest, USA. Four measures of diversity were used: the number of species (S), evenness of relative abundance (J), the Shannon-Wiener index (H') and Simpson's index (D). We show that (1) the PCEs on biotic diversity were similar for both invasive species among the four measures of diversity we examined; (2) the relationship between plant diversity and invasive plant abundance ranges from linear (constant slope) to negative exponential (variable slope), the latter signifying that the PCEs are density-dependent; (3) the PCEs were density-dependent for measures of diversity sensitive to the number of species (S, H', D) but not for the measure that relied solely upon relative abundance (J); and (4) invader abundance was not correlated with other potential influences on biodiversity (hydrology, soils, topography). These results indicate that both species are capable of reducing plant community diversity, and management strategies need to consider the simultaneous control of multiple species if the goal is to maintain diverse plant communities.

Characterizing ecological generalization in plant-pollination systems								OECOLOGIA				148	3			365	372		10.1007/s00442-006-0396-1			JUN 2006	2006	Despite the development of diversity indices in community ecology that incorporate both richness and evenness, pollination biologists commonly use only pollinator richness to estimate generalization. Similarly, while pollination biologists have stressed the utility of pollinator importance, incorporating both pollinator abundance and effectiveness, importance values have not been included in estimates of generalization in pollination systems. In this study, we estimated pollinator generalization for 17 plant species using Simpson's diversity index, which includes richness and evenness. We compared these estimates with estimates based on only pollinator richness, and compared diversity estimates calculated using importance data with those using only visitation data. We found that pollinator richness explains only 57-65% of the variation in diversity, and that, for most plant species, pollinator importance was determined primarily by differences in visitation rather than by differences in effectiveness. While simple richness may suffice for broad comparisons of pollinator generalization, measures that incorporate evenness will provide a much more accurate understanding of generalization. Although incorporating labor-intensive measurements of pollinator effectiveness are less necessary for broad surveys, effectiveness estimates will be important for detailed studies of some plant species. Unfortunately, at this point it is impossible to predict a priori which species these are.

J	Jackson, Randall D.; Allen-Diaz, Barbara								Spring-fed wetland and riparian plant communities respond differently to altered grazing intensity								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY				43	3			485	498		10.1111/j.1365-2664.2006.01150.x			JUN 2006	2006	1. Spring-fed wetlands are nested within California's oak savanna-annual grassland, which is considered a non-equilibrium-type system because it shows little community-level response to changes in grazing intensity. This insensitivity to disturbance is thought to result from transient resource limitation and the annual life cycle tending to swamp the effects of defoliation. Because spring-fed wetlands receive relatively consistent and high inputs of water and nutrients, and they are dominated by perennial herbaceous vegetation, we hypothesized that these systems would respond to a grazing intensity gradient in a predictable manner, i.e. equilibrium dynamics would prevail. 2. We experimentally tested plant community responses of spring-fed wetlands to two levels of grazing intensity (light and moderate) and no grazing over 10 years. Wetland vegetation was tracked at two distinct geomorphological parts of the wetland system: spring heads, where emergent water formed marshy zones, and their resultant channelized creeks. 3. We used linear mixed effects models to estimate grazing intensity effects over time. A general result at both springs and creeks was that slope estimates of annual total herbaceous cover over time were negative under moderate grazing but positive under light grazing and grazing removal. 4. Diversity metrics were not affected by grazing treatments at springs. At creeks, Simpson's diversity index increased over time under moderate grazing. When averaged over 10 years, species evenness and Shannon's diversity index were greater under moderate grazing at creeks. 5. Species composition was highly variable from year to year at springs, with no separation of the first ordination axis (detrended correspondence analysis) amongst grazing treatments. In contrast, three relatively stable and distinct equilibria were evident for creeks. These results indicate that springs exhibited non-equilibrium dynamics while their creek counterparts, separated by several metres, behaved in a more equilibrium fashion, in relative terms. 6. Grazing removal significantly increased interannual variability in species composition at both geomorphological types, demonstrating that plant-animal interactions serve as the main control on community composition in these systems by reducing cover and promoting diversity and stability. 7. Synthesis and applications. Grazing managers in California's oak savanna-annual grassland have little control of species composition because the annual community is entrained by the weather. Our results show that first-order wetland-riparian communities nested within this annual grassland matrix can be manipulated via grazing intensity adjustments. However, marshy spring-fed wetland areas are less sensitive than channelized creeks to these manipulations and grazing removal will increase variability in species composition for both geomorphological types. Grazing management decisions are usually made at the landscape level based on the matrix vegetation, but nested ecosystems may respond differentially, requiring a more nuanced approach that includes site-specific information.

A rapid screening method based on gross colony morphological features and color reference standards was compared with traditional fungal taxonomic methods and PCR-RFLP for estimation of ecological indices of soil microfungal community composition. Normalized counts of colony morphotypes on dichloran rose bengal medium were used to estimate species richness (S) and evenness (J) and to calculate Shannon's diversity (H) and Simpson's (SI) dominance indices. Isolates were obtained by dilution plating techniques from litter and soil layer samples taken from Douglas-fir forest and clear-cut areas at two locations in the Cascade Mountains. The highest correspondence (97%) was observed between taxonomic identification and RFLP patterns (32:33). Cladistic analyses of PCR-RFLP patterns indicated an 81% correspondence between RFLP patterns:colony morphotypes (33:41). A correspondence of 78% was observed between traditional taxonomic identification:colony morphotypes (32:41). Statistical analyses of ecological indices based on quantitative'application of the colony morphotyping method indicated significant differences (P < 0.05) in fungal community composition between forested and clear-cut areas at the Toad Road site but not at the Falls Creek site. Comparisons of ecological indices based on traditional identification of taxa by microscopic characterization on defined culture media resulted in identical findings of statistical significance. The colony morphotyping approach is proposed as a screening method to identify potential effects of land management practices, edaphic factors and pollutants on microfungal diversity.

J	Pekarek, Elizabeth; Jacobson, Kathryn; Donovan, Anna								High levels of genetic variation exist in aspergillus niger populations infecting welwitschia mirabilis hook								JOURNAL OF HEREDITY				97	3			270	278		10.1093/jhered/esj031			MAY 2006	2006	Aspergillus niger is an asexual, haploid fungus which infects the seeds of Namibia's national plant, Welwitschia mirabilis, severely affecting plant viability. We used 31 randomly amplified polymorphic DNA markers to assess genetic variation among 89 A. niger isolates collected from three W. mirabilis populations in the Namib Desert. While all isolates belonged to the same vegetative compatibility group, 84% were unique genotypes, and estimates of genotypic evenness and Simpson's index of diversity approached 1.0 in the three populations. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that 78% of the total variation sampled was among isolates from individual W. mirabilis plants. Lower, but significant, amounts of variation detected among isolates from different plants (12%) and different sites (10%) also indicated some site- and plant-level genetic differentiation. Total gene diversity (H-T = 0.264) was mostly attributable to diversity within populations (H-S = 0.217); the relatively low level of genetic differentiation among the sites (G(ST) = 0.141) suggests that gene flow is occurring among the three distant sites. Although sexual reproduction has never been observed in this fungus, parasexuality is a well-known phenomenon in laboratory strains. We thus attribute the high levels of genetic variation to parasexuality and/or wind-facilitated gene flow from an as of yet undocumented broader host range of the fungus on other desert vegetation. Given the apparent ease of transmission, high levels of genetic diversity, and potentially broad host range, A. niger infections of W. mirabilis may be extremely difficult to control or prevent.

Both of the markers worked effectively in clone identification of C. grandis. RAPD markers detected more diversity than ISSR markers in the three populations examined. Of the 60 RAPD primers screened, seven produced highly reproducible bands. Using these primers, a total of 61 DNA fragments were generated with 52 (85.25%) being polymorphic indicating considerable genetic variation at the species level. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that a large proportion of genetic variation (81.5%) resided within Populations, while only a small proportion (18.5%) resided among populations. With the use of 52 polymorphic RAPD markers, we were able to identify 127 genets among 342 samples from three populations. The proportion of distinguishable genets (PD: mean 0.37), Simpson's diversity index (D: mean 0.91), and evenness (E: mean 0.78) exhibited high levels of clonal diversity compared to other clonal plants. These results imply that sexual reproduction has played an important role at some time during the history of these populations. Nevertheless, the high level of diversity could have been also partially generated from somatic mutations, although this is unlikely to account for the high diversity generally found among C. grandis genets.

J	Metlen, KL; Fiedler, CE								Restoration treatment effects on the understory of ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir forests in western Montana, USA								FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT				222	1-3			355	369		10.1016/j.foreco.2005.10.037			FEB 15 2006	2006	Fire exclusion and high-grade logging have altered the structure and function of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests across the American West. Restoration treatments are increasingly being used in these forests to move stand density, structure, and species composition toward more historically sustainable conditions. Yet little research has focused on how restoration treatments influence the associated understory plant communities, particularly in the northern Rocky Mountains of the USA. To this end, we implemented a replicated (N = 3), randomized block experiment in a second-growth western Montana ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forest that initiated after harvest in the early 1900s and has not burned since. We evaluated the effects of no action (control), silvicultural cutting (thin-only), spring burning (burn-only), and silvicultural cutting followed by spring burning (thin-burn) on the understory community. Treatments were implemented at an operational scale (9 ha). Data were collected before treatment and in three subsequent years, at two spatial scales: plot (1000 m(2)) and quadrat (I m(2)). Richness, Simpson's evenness index, and cover were calculated for the total vascular plant community. Species origin and lifeform were used to further investigate richness and cover responses to treatment. Treatments differentially impacted the understory community, with the most dramatic changes in the thin-burn. The burn-only treatment initially reduced richness and cover of the understory, but by year three all active treatments increased plot-scale understory richness relative to pre-treatment and the control. Simpson's evenness increased the first growing season after burning, but was not influenced by treatment in subsequent years. Forbs, both native and exotic, were the most responsive lifeform and increased in richness and cover after thinning, with the greatest response in the thin-burn. Increased native richness was not detected at the quadrat-scale in any treatment, but was significant at the plot-scale in numerous combinations of treatments and years. A short-term reduction in shrub richness and abundance after burning was detected at the quadrat-scale. Sapling density was reduced in all active treatments. Although active treatments create more open overstories and increase understory diversity at the stand level, a mix of treated and untreated areas will likely maximize heterogeneity and diversity at the landscape scale.

We conducted a year-long survey of the fruit-feeding butterfly fauna of four sacred groves and two forest reserves in the moist semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana to characterize resident species diversity and complementarity among communities. Joint analysis of frugivorous butterfly diversity at these six forest fragments, which ranged in size from 6 to 5000 ha, was used to evaluate the conservation potential of these ancient indigenous reserves. A total of 6836 individuals were trapped across all sites, representing 79 species and five subfamilies. Community diversity was characterized in terms of, (a) number of species accumulated versus sampling effort, (b) rarefied species richness, (c) nonparametric richness estimates, (d) species evenness, (e) Simpson's Index of Diversity, and (f) complementarity of communities. Diversity of the fruit-feeding butterfly communities, quantified in terms of both species evenness and rarefied species richness, was higher at the larger forest reserves than at the small sacred forest groves. Additionally, although all sites had species trapped only at that site, the 5000-ha forest reserve harbored a resident community that was clearly distinctive from and more diverse than the other communities including the other forest reserve. Hence, our findings add to the burgeoning body of data that indicates large reserves are the foundation of successful conservation programs. Nonetheless, we found these small forest patches contribute to biodiversity conservation in at least three ways and these are identified and discussed. We also identify a number of species that appear more or less vulnerable to dynamics of forest fragmentation based on changes in their relative abundance across sites and we interpret these data in the context of potential indicator species and theoretical predictions of at-risk species.

There are numerous indices and measures available to describe sample diversity. Twenty-two measures of species richness, diversity and evenness were reviewed using six sets of ethnomedicinal data derived from 50 formal muti shop traders (of different ethnicities) and 100 informal street traders of traditional medicine in Johannesburg, South Africa, and a seventh data set from traders on the western boundary of the Kruger National Park, South Africa. The diversity measures were coupled with species accumulation curves to construct cumulative diversity curves used to determine the minimum viable sample size on which a diversity index should be based, and to better understand the differences in the relative diversities of the samples. Distinct differences in the relative abundance and diversity of plants sold by street traders and shop traders were evident. Species diversity and evenness was found to be higher in shops, thus resulting in a lower dominance in the sale of certain plant species compared to the street traders. A survey of an informal market should include no less than 35 research participants compared to no less than 20 for the muti shops. The use of selected indices of species richness (Margalef's), diversity (Shannon, Simpson's, Fisher's alpha, Hill's numbers) and evenness are recommended as a means of describing patterns exhibited within ethnobotanical data.

Percent composition of families and number of commercial species found in the plot PL2 were lower in comparison with those of the two other plots. The medium Sorensen similarity index, ranging from 29.55 to 40.25%, found for all tree size classes showed a slightly high dissimilarity between plots. Simpson's index for all tree size classes was quite similar among plots though only small difference was found for seedlings in the plot PL2. Shannon-Wiener index (H') in all plots exhibited relatively high, ranging from 1.76 to 3.48, for all size classes combined but revealed slightly low diversity indices for commercial species. Species richness and evenness (H) turned out to be the best indices for demonstrating diversity among plots. The size class distribution with Weibull model showed nearly a continuously inverse J-shaped curve. Except the plot PL2 and the plot. PL12 followed a similarly exponential trend, the plot PL22 showed a left skewed shape. However, the result of basal area showed that the PL12 had lower basal area than others. All plots showed having some commercial species with relatively high importance value index along with a proportion contributed by other noncommercial ones, i.e. Syzygium cinereum and Diospyros apiculata.

Two experiments were performed. In each experiment two sets of replicate SBRs were operated for a periods of three times the SRT. One set was operated at an SRT of 2 days and another set was operated at an SRT of 8 days. Samples for T-RFLP analysis were collected from the two sets of replicate reactors. HhaI, MspI, and RsaI T-RFLP profiles were analyzed using cluster analysis and diversity statistics. Cluster analysis with Ward's method using Jaccard distance and Hellinger distance showed that the bacterial community structure in both sets of reactors from both experimental runs was dynamic and that replicate reactors were clustered together and evolved similarly from startup. Richness (S), evenness (E), the Shannon-Weaver index (H), and the reciprocal of Simpson's index (1/D) were calculated, and the values were compared between the two sets of reactors. Evenness values were higher for reactors operated at an SRT of 2 days. Statistically significant differences in diversity (H and D) between the two sets of reactors were tested using a randomization procedure, and the results showed that reactors from both experimental runs that were operated at an SRT of 2 days had higher diversity (H and D) at the 5% level. T-RFLP analysis with diversity indices proved to be a powerful tool to analyze changes in the bacterial community diversity in response to changes in the operational parameters of activated- sludge systems.

Yellow sticky traps were used to qualify and quantify the number of aerial leafhoppers from 1 May 2001 until 4 September 2001. A total of 4,523 individuals, belonging to 39 species within seven leafhopper subfamilies, were trapped. The weekly mean number of leafhoppers collected was significantly higher on traps from 'Patriot', followed by 'Frontier' and 'Prospector', than on traps from the USNA seedling selections. Although the weekly mean species richness for 'Prospector' was lower than the other two cultivars, the three cultivars had higher mean species richness than the USNA seedling selections of U. szechuanica and U. bergmanniana. Diversity among cultivars was higher than among the USNA seedling selections. Ulmus bergmanniana 68983 and U. szechuanica 68986 shared the highest percentage of species similarity, while 'Frontier' and U. szechuanica 68991 were the most dissimilar. Of the species collected, Agallia quadripunctata, Empoasca fabae and Graphocephala versuta were the most abundant. The other species were mostly rare based on their low abundance. Scaphoideus luteolus, the only confirmed vector of elm yellows in North America, was found among the elm cultivars only. Yet, the Cicadellinae leafhoppers that are vectors of Xylella fastidiosa, the causal agent of bacterial leaf scorch, were found among both the cultivars and USNA seedling selections. Such data could allow for the screening and selection of elms resistant to economically important leafhoppers.

J	Johnson, MJ; Giller, PS; O'Halloran, J; O'Gorman, K; Gallaher, MB								A novel approach to assess the impact of landuse activity on chemical and biological parameters in river catchments								FRESHWATER BIOLOGY				50	7			1273	1289		10.1111/j.1365-2427.2005.01389.x			JUL 2005	2005	1. Natural variation in environmental parameters, as well as practical constraints in study design and sampling methodology, often pose difficulties in treating impact assessments in river catchments as controlled field experiments. It is frequently impossible to develop robust relationships between reference and test stations prior to the onset of an impact and the range of statistical tools which can be adopted in data analysis to detect a change or disturbance is limited. 2. In an attempt to overcome these problems we introduce a novel disturbance index to assess the impact of landuse activities on river systems. The index identifies differences in hydrochemical parameters and macroinvertebrate community metrics between reference and test stations (at a set level of significance). This approach allows for objective assessment of the occurrence and direction of change as well as the duration of an impact. The disturbance index can be applied at different scales - for a single stream, a catchment or a region. 3. In this paper we describe the derivation of the index and illustrate its utility through worked examples. We use the index to assess impact of clearfelling on hydrochemical parameters such as hydrogen ion concentration, total hardness, suspended solids, conductivity and nitrate concentration as well as on macroinvertebrate parameters including abundance, richness, reciprocal of Simpson's diversity index, evenness, Ephemeroptera/Plecoptera/Trichoptera (EPT) richness and percentage of EPT taxa. 4. The sensitivity of the disturbance index changes with scale of application however, and the clearfelling (CF) index has proven sensitive to the detection of even quite small changes, although in these cases ecological significance should be considered. We show that the CF index, particularly when derived from a regional scale, is a conservative index but is very robust to variation in the number of samples used in its derivation. The application of the index corresponded very well with the application of more standard statistical approaches. We believe that the index can thus be applied to other impact studies with similar project design.

J	Wilsey, BJ; Chalcraft, DR; Bowles, CM; Willig, MR								Relationships among indices suggest that richness is an incomplete surrogate for grassland biodiversity								ECOLOGY				86	5			1178	1184		10.1890/04-0394			MAY 2005	2005	Although many indices estimate diversity, species richness recently has been used as a surrogate for diversity in many studies in ecology, biogeography, and conservation. Underlying assumptions of this approach are that all diversity indices, including those that weight species importance by their relative abundance (e.g., evenness), are correlated positively, and that richness accounts for a large proportion of the variance in diversity. We addressed these assumptions with data from six grassland sites using univariate and multivariate analyses of a variety of indices (species evenness, richness, rarity, dominance, and Simpson's diversity index). Univariate correlations between plant species evenness and richness were weak and negative at each site. Principal-component analyses consistently revealed two significant components of variation in diversity. Richness and evenness were largely orthogonal, with Simpson's diversity loading between them. Thus, measures of species diversity based on relative abundance, as well as richness, may be necessary to capture the full complexity of diversity in conservation studies and in experiments of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. At these and perhaps other sites, species richness was an incomplete surrogate for diversity.

The different approaches were applied in two marine ecosystems affected by the same heavy metal contamination source, coastal waters off Portman and the Mar Menor coastal lagoon, both in SE Spain. Two marine biotic indices proposed for application in the Directive (AMBI and BENTIX) were used, together with community descriptors (abundance, Shannon-Wiener diversity, Margalef's species richness, Pielou's evenness and Simpson's Dominance), the relative benthic index (RBI) and the abundance-biomass comparison method (ABC). Water-sediment interface toxicity bioassays using sea urchin embryos and sediment metal analysis served to check the classifications obtained. The classical community descriptors pointed to a progressive variation in benthic communities along the metal contamination gradient of Portman, but, they did not correctly characterize the environmental status of the lagoon stations. Although the RBI was the index that best classified the sites according to their degree of pollution, the selection of indicator species can bias the results. Since the AMBI, the BENTIX and the ABC method are based on the pollution resulting from organic enrichment, their application in the case of purely toxic pollution may not be successful, as was found to be the case in these two mining-polluted ecosystems. Therefore, the development of new indicator lists according to the type of pollutant may serve to improve the results obtained with organic enrichment-based indices when studying other kinds of disturbance. Finally, we found the toxicity tests to be useful tools for the environmental assessment of aquatic ecosystems, and recommend their inclusion in the WFD. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Payne, LX; Schindler, DE; Parrish, JK; Temple, SA								Quantifying spatial pattern with evenness indices								ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS				15	2			507	520		10.1890/03-5029			APR 2005	2005	Quantifying the spatial distributions of organisms in simple and meaningful ways is important for understanding the ecology and habitat needs of species subject to anthropogenic disturbances. Most multi-species conservation and management programs do not yet account for the variation of space-use patterns exhibited by species preferring the same habitat type. To measure species' space-use patterns as a step toward determining habitat needs, we suggest using evenness indices. Although commonly used in characterizing communities (i.e., as a measure of species diversity), these indices are suitable for characterizing many other ecological patterns, including patterns of site use by individuals. We investigate the statistical properties of five indices (Camargo's index of evenness, E'; Simpson's index of evenness, E-1/D; Lloyd's index of mean crowding, J; Smith-Wilson index E-var; and Dispersion index, D-L, a variant of the Shannon diversity index) to evaluate their utility for quantifying broad-scale spatial patterns of migratory shorebirds. We use a Monte Carlo simulation approach to compare these indices for their (1) ability to characterize a wide range of spatial patterns (from even to patchy); (2) ability to discriminate among distributions; and (3) robustness to incomplete sampling. In addition, we compare the ability of these indices to characterize spatial dispersion for four species of shorebirds migrating through the United States: Killdeer (Charadrius vociferus), Semipalmated Plover (C. semipalmatus), Sanderling (Calidris alba), and Red Knot (C. canutus). Overall, we recommend Camargo, Simpson, and Lloyd indices for quantifying spatial dispersion. All three indices gave precise and unbiased estimates once 35 or more sites (3.5% of 1000 simulated sites) were sampled randomly, regardless of the degree of patchiness. Nonrandom sampling resulted in biased estimates until a much greater proportion of sites (at least 30-50%) were sampled, highlighting the importance of site selection in sampling programs. Our analysis of shorebird spatial patterns revealed that evenness indices discriminate well among the species we considered, ranking Killdeer as most dispersed and Red Knot as most aggregated. Our results agree with earlier (independent) assessments of these species' migration strategies and illustrate how simple univariate metrics may be useful tools for characterizing complex spatial patterns.

J	Johnson, MTJ; Agrawal, AA								Plant genotype and environment interact to shape a diverse arthropod community on evening primrose (<i>Oenothera biennis</i>)								ECOLOGY				86	4			874	885		10.1890/04-1068			APR 2005	2005	Both an individual ' s genotype and environment govern its phenotype, and this phenotype may have extended consequences for species interactions and communities. We examined the importance of plant genotype and environmental factors operating at large (habitat) and small (microhabitat) spatial scales in affecting a multitrophic arthropod community on plants. We planted 926 plants from 14 genotypes of Oenothera biennis into five natural habitats that represent the range of environments in which this plant. locally occurs. Genotypic differences among plants accounted for as much as 41% of the variation in arthropod diversity (Simpson ' s diversity index) and also affected arthropod evenness, richness, abundance, and biomass on individual plants. However, the effects of particular plant genotypes on the arthropod community varied across habitats (i.e., there were significant plant genotype-by-habitat interactions). Plant genotype explained more variation in the arthropod community than did environmental variation among microhabitats, but less variation than habitats, as predicted by the scale-dependent hypothesis. Herbivores and omnivores were more strongly affected by plant genetic variation than predators, consistent with the notion that phytophagous insects undergo stronger reciprocal interactions with plants than do predators. We detected heritable variation in arthropod community variables and the ability for the herbivore community to select on plant traits, suggesting that evolution in O. biennis can lead to changes in the arthropod community. Genetic variation in plant size, architecture, and reproductive phenology were the plant traits most strongly correlated with arthropod community variables. Our results demonstrate that genotype-by-environment interactions are a major determinant of arthropod community structure.

J	Buzas, MA; Hayek, LAC								On richness and evenness within and between communities								PALEOBIOLOGY				31	2			199	220		10.1666/0094-8373(2005)031[0199:ORAEWA]2.0.CO;2			SPR 2005	2005	Although there is extraordinary interest in the quantitative measurement of species diversity, published statements on the behavior of the components of species diversity are contradictory and lead to opposite conclusions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the confusion is due to two key oversights: (1) whether or not biological sampling is carried out within or between communities; and (2) determination of the statistical distribution underlying a biological community, which is crucial for the evaluation of all of the components of diversity measurement. The problem of sampling "within" a population or community is basically distinct from the equivalent integration of structure and diversity measurement "between" differing multispecies populations. "Within-community sampling" is defined as a set of biological samples from a statistical population that has a particular statistical distribution or a constant value for the associated parameter(s). As the number of individuals increases along with the number of species, for a log series distribution, the diversity measures of Shannon's H, log series or Fisher's alpha, and Simpson's Index 1/lambda remain constant while the evenness measures of Buzas-Gibson's E and Pielou's J decrease. For a log-normal distribution, J will remain constant while E decreases and alpha, 1/lambda, and H increase. No single measure of evenness remains constant over all statistical distributions, so if constancy as a type of independence is required, the appropriate distribution must first be determined. Each species ensemble is mathematically fixed by the applicable statistical distribution. In contrast, "between-community sampling" is defined as a set of biological samples from different statistical distributions and/or the same distribution with differing parametric values. If sampling is between communities and S increases while the number of individuals remains constant, then all the other measures considered here increase. The exception is the broken stick, for which E remains constant while H, J, alpha, and 1/lambda increase. Herein we propose and justify the use of the log-series distribution (with regression on the information decomposition equation) as a null model for determination of community structure and demonstrate that the community structure of a Miocene bed at Calvert Cliffs, Maryland, is a log series by use of this new unified methodology.

Vaccinium uliginosum is the only one of these for which the extent of clonality is unknown. Therefore, the clonal structure of two V. uliginosum populations was inferred from random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers. Among the 47 sampled patches, 61 clones were identified. The mean values of the number of clones divided by the number of samples (G/N), the Simpson's index (D), and the genotypic evenness (E) were 0.28, 0.95, and 0.96, respectively. Vaccinium uliginosum exhibited a typical phalanx growth strategy that resulted in structured populations at the ramet level, that is, ramets belonging to the same clone were closely associated and formed distinct clumps. However, at the clone level, populations were not structured, that is, genetic distances between pairs of clones were not correlated with the spatial distances between the clones within a population. Genetic diversity was as high as that in nonclonal species (mean value of Shannon's diversity index (H-o) = 0.647). In accord with the life history traits of V. uliginosum (long-lived species with a mixed breeding system and potentially high seed dispersal), most of the genetic variation was found within populations.

J	Bento, FM; Camargo, FAD; Okeke, BC; Frankenberger, WT								Diversity of biosurfactant producing microorganisms isolated from soils contaminated with diesel oil								MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH				160	3			249	255		10.1016/j.micres.2004.08.005			2005	2005	Biosurfactant production is a desirable property of hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (HDM). We characterized biosurfactant producing microbial. populations from a Long Beach soil, California (USA) and a Hong Kong soil (China), contaminated with diesel oil. A total of 33 hydrocarbon-utilizing microorganisms were isolated from the soils. Twelve isolates and three defined consortia were tested for biosurfactant production and emulsification activity. The highest reduction of surface tension was achieved with a consortium of L1, L2 and L3 isolates from a Long Beach soil (41.4 mNm(-1)). Isolate L1 (Acinetobacter junii) displayed the highest reduction of surface tension (46.5mNm(-1)). The emulsifying capacity evaluated by the E-24 emulsification index was highest in the culture of isolate L5 (74%). No substantial emulsification was achieved with the cell-free extracts, indicating that the emulsifying activity was not extracellular. Based on surface tension and the E24 index results, isolates F1, F2, F3, F4, L1, L2, L3 and L4 were identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Bacillus cereus, Bacillus sphaericus, B. fusiformis, Acinetobacter junii, a non-cultured bacterium, Pseudomonas sp. and B. pumilus, respectively. Cluster analyses of 16S rRNA gene sequences of the bacterial isolates revealed 70% similarity amongst hydrocarbon-degrading bacterial community present in both soils. Five isolates (isolates F1, F2, F3, F4 and L4) belong to the Firmicutes order, two isolates (L1 and L3) belong to the Proteobacteria order and one isolate (L2) is an Actinomyces sp. Simpson's index (1 - D) and the Shannon-Weaver index (H) revealed more diversity of HDM in the Hong Kong soil, white evenness (E) and the equitabitity (J) data indicated that there was not a dominant population. Bacterial isolates displaying substantial potential for production of biosurfactants can be applied in the bioremediation of soils contaminated with petroleum hydrocarbons. (c) 2005 Elsevier GmbH.

Before and after its construction, fish and physical and chemical variables were examined to determine weir's impact on the reach. Fish captured by electrofishing were measured (total length), and population density and length distribution of the species were estimated. Species diversity (Shannon's diversity index), dominance (Simpson's dominance index) and evenness were also calculated. The results revealed an increase in fish population density, especially in smaller specimens, but a decrease in the larger fishes. Substrate and shelter alterations could explain the observed variations in the fish community. In order to improve the consolidation of well-developed fish populations, the placement of great boulders and the restoration of the riparian vegetation are suggested.

However, many entomologists (both within Canada and worldwide) continue to publish studies without standardizing their data to take sampling effort into account. We present a case study to illustrate the importance of such standardization, using the collection of spiders (Araneae) by pitfall traps as model data. Data were analyzed using rarefaction to represent one example of a taxon sampling curve, and by a variety of traditional diversity indices to describe alpha diversity. Raw species richness and single-index diversity measures (Shannon-Wiener, Simpson's, and Fisher's alpha) provided contradictory results. Rarefied species richness standardized to the number of individuals collected enabled more accurate comparisons of diversity and revealed when sampling was insufficient. Focusing on arthropods occurring in forested ecosystems, we also examined the use of taxon sampling curves in current literature by reviewing 133 published articles from 14 journals. Only 26% of the published articles in our review used a taxon sampling curve, and raw species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index of diversity were the most commonly used estimates. There is clearly a need to modify how alpha diversity is measured and compared for arthropod biodiversity studies. We recommend the abandonment of both raw species richness and single-index measures of diversity, and reiterate the need to use rarefaction or a related technique that allows for meaningful comparisons of species richness while taking into account sampling effort.

The results show that the groundwater depth in the lower reaches of Tarim River rose from, 9.87 m before the conveyances to 7.74 m and 3.79 m after the first and second conveyances, 3.61 and 3.16 m after the 2 phases of the third conveyance, and 2.66 m after the fourth conveyance. The transverse response scope of groundwater level was gradually enlarged along both sides of the channel of conveyances, i.e., from 450 m in width after the first conveyance to 1050 m after the fourth conveyance, but the response degree of groundwater level was reduced With the increase of the distance away from the channel of conveyances. The composition, distribution and growth status of the natural vegetation are directly related to the groundwater depth. The indexes of Simpson's biodiversity, McIntosh's evenness and Margalef's richness, which reflect the change of the quantity of species and the degree of biodiversity, are reduced from 0.70, 0.48 and 0.90 to 0.26, 0.17 and 0.37 respectively along with the drawdown of groundwater level from the upper reaches to the lower reaches. After the stream water conveyances, the natural vegetation in the lower reaches is saved and restored along with the rise of groundwater level, the response scope of vegetation is gradually enlarged, i.e., from 200-250 m in width after the first conveyance to 800 m after the fourth conveyance. However, there is still a great disparity to the objective of protecting the "Green Corridor" in the lower reaches of Tarim River. Thus, it is suggested to convey the stream water in double-channel way, combine the conveyance with water supply in surface scope, or construct the modern pipe-conveyance network systems so as to save the natural vegetation in an intensive way, achieve the efficient water consumption and speed up the restoration and regeneration of the damaged ecosystems in the lower reaches of Tarim River.

Four different disturbance groups were considered depending on the time since last thinning and the presence/absence of grazers. Plant species cover varied among disturbance groups for 17 out of the total 47 species present in the study area. In general, disturbance by clear-cutting favoured the cover of Betula alba, Castanea sativa and Quercus robur. The shrub species most affected by disturbance were heathers. Among these, the most drastic effect was found for Calluna vulgaris, Daboecia cantabrica and Erica vagans which disappeared in those woodlands subjected to grazing. Several nemoral species, such as Vaccinium myrtillus, Blechnum spicant and Lamiastrum galeobdolon, were absent in these same grazed forests. By contrast, generalist species, such as Ruscus aculeatus, Geranium robertianum and Veronica officinalis, were mostly present in the grazed woodlands. Diversity was measured as Species Richness as well as with the Shannon's and Simpson's indices. Plant species richness did not vary with disturbance treatment, however, it was highest for trees and shrubs at those woodlands in an advanced stage of regeneration, and for herbs in the lowest and highest disturbance groups. Besides, only the third vertical layer (2.5-10 m) was affected by disturbance treatment. Simpson's was the best index to explain the observed differences in the structure of woodlands subjected to unalike levels of disturbance. Species diversity was highest in woodlands with lowest disturbance or in an advanced state of regeneration. Woodlands with lowest disturbance had the highest diversity of trees and those woodlands in an advanced state of regeneration showed the highest diversity of shrub species. Regarding vertical structure, diversity was mostly affected in the intermediate layer (2.5-10 m), with highest values found in woodlands at the lowest disturbance group, i.e. at least 100 years of no disturbance. Two indices of evenness, i.e. Pielou's and Simpson's were also calculated in this study. Results here presented suggest that plant species composition, percent cover of individual plant species, and the Simpson's diversity index (applied considering the different growth-forms and vertical layers) are suitable and complementary indices to evaluate disturbance at the studied woodlands.

Based on the results of cluster analysis of species compositions of copepods collected, we could distinguish 3 copepod species composition groups, each associated with one of the 3 different water masses. The 1st group was associated with the Kuroshio Branch Current. It had high values for Shannon's species diversity and Simpson's species evenness indices. The dominant species in this group were Temora turbinata, Paracalanus parvus and Canthocalanus pauper. The 2nd group was associated with the China Coastal Current. It had low values for Shannon's diversity and Simpson's evenness indices, and its dominant species were P. parvus, Euchaeta sp., and Calanus sinicus. The 3rd group was found in the area receiving freshwater intrusion from the Tanshui River of Taiwan. It had the lowest values for Shannon's diversity and Simpson's evenness indices among the 3 groups.

Zoological Studies 43(2): 350-365. The aim of this study was to identify the influence of copper pollution on benthic copepod populations by means of dosing seabed sediments with copper. Superficial muddy sediments were removed from a shallow subtidal experimental site on the west coast of Scotland and dosed with copper powder to produce nominal dry weight concentrations of 0, 50, 500, and 5000 mug/g sediment. Four replicate 100 cm(3) polycarbonate bottles were filled with spiked sediment for each concentration, and the bottles were implanted into the seabed at the experimental site. After 1 mo, the bottles, together with replicate core samples from the untreated background sediment, were collected, the meiofauna was extracted using colloidal silica, and the copper concentration was measured. In relation to the controls, copepod abundance was significantly depressed in the high-copper treatment. Composite diversity indices (Shannon-Wiener and Simpson's) and evenness failed to exhibit any copper-induced changes, although the number of species and genera were depressed at the highest concentration. Differences in the responses of copepods to copper were found between copepodites and adults and among different species. In general, the dominance of Tachidiella minuta and species of Halectinosoma and Longipedia in the control and low copper concentrations was replaced by dominance of species of Cletodes, Laophonte, and Stenhelia at the higher concentrations. The abundance of Cletodes longicaudatus was significantly enhanced in the high-copper treatment. The only statistical evidence for an impact of copper on the copepod assemblage at levels lower than the high treatment was revealed by applying the multivariate test ANOSIM (analysis of similarities) to the copepodite abundance data at the generic level, with the copepodite assemblage in the medium treatment being of a significantly different composition to that in the controls. Results are discussed in relation to other studies on the impact of pollution on the meiofaunal taxa, the likely mechanisms bringing about the observed changes, and the validity of this in situ approach. http://www.sinica.edu.tw/zool/zoolstud/43.2/350.pdf.

J	Kirkagac, MU; Pulatsü, S; Köksal, G								Effects of land-based trout farms on the benthic macroinvertebrate community in a Turkish brook								ISRAELI JOURNAL OF AQUACULTURE-BAMIDGEH				56	1			59	67					MAR 2004	2004	Benthic macroinvertebrates and physico-chemical parameters were surveyed at the source of the Karasu Brook in Bozuyuk, Bilecik Province, Turkey, and at the inlets and outlets of five rainbow trout farms that use the brook water and discharge effluents into it. The dissolved oxygen, pH, ammonia-nitrogen, nitrite-nitrogen, nitrate-nitrogen and total phosphorus in the farm effluents were within effluent standards for trout farming in different countries. The macroinvertebrate community in the brook consisted of Mollusca, Gastropoda (Physidae, Limnaedae, Planorbidae, Neritidae), Bivalvia (Spharidae), Annelidae, Oligochaeta (Tubificidae), Hirudinea (Glossiphonidae, Erpobdellidae), Arthropoda, Insecta (Chironomidae, Ephemerellidae) and Crustacea (Gammaridae, Asellidae). Tubificidae and Chironomidae were generally observed in all sampling stations; the highest abundance was in the inlets and outlets of the two farms nearest the source. The most common measures of biodiversity, i.e., richness, Simpson's index, Shannon-Wiener index and evenness, were used during the year-long study.

J	Ricotta, C; Chiarucci, A; Avena, G								Quantifying the effects of nutrient addition on community diversity of serpentine vegetation using parametric entropy of type α								ACTA OECOLOGICA-INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY				25	1-2			61	65		10.1016/j.actao.2003.11.002			MAR 2004	2004	A desirable property of a diversity index is the so-called sum property. For a diversity index that possesses the sum property, such as species richness N, Shannon's entropy H or Simpson's index I ID, the community diversity is decomposable into species-level patterns and the sum of single species diversities gives the pooled diversity of the species collection. In this paper, parametric diversity of type a is used to quantify how fertilizer applied to soil affects the relative contribution of species endemic or preferential to serpentine soils within a garigue plant community in Tuscany (Italy). Soil fertilizer significantly improved the biomass production of the original species pool without any significant colonization by alien species. However, the major biomass increments were experienced by species that are not exclusive to serpentine soils. In this view, the reduced abundance of species endemic or preferential to serpentine soils can be interpreted as a loss of 'ecological quality' of the analyzed community. (C) 2003 Elsevier SAS.

The study sites were located in the western Mediterranean basin along the coasts of Morocco, Tunisia, the Maltese Islands and Italy. These were typical beach-dune ecosystems more (Smir, Morocco; Zouara, Tunisia; Burano, Italy) or less (Ir-Ramla tat-Torri, Malta and Ir-Ramla 1-Hamra, Gozo) structurally developed accordingly. Species richness was evaluated using standard trapping techniques with pitfall traps along the transects perpendicular to the shoreline. Only isopods and coleopterans were used in the analysis. In each locality, an analysis was conducted on both the beach and the dune separately, and on the entire ecosystem in the two seasons (spring and autumn). Species were studied both quantitatively and qualitatively using ecological coefficients (relative abundance) and Fisher's diversity index. To evaluate the evenness of the community, Shannon-Weaver index was calculated and compared with Brillouin index. For both indices, the maximum values were computed and were used to obtain the evenness of the community through Pielou index. In addition, Simpson's dominance index was considered. Percentages of similarities between localities were analysed in the two seasons and in total using the Renkonen index. The overall analysis showed that general trends could be found for both orders that were studied and gave indications on habitat quality. The study showed that when monitoring was carried out systematically both in space and time, arthropods could be used as important tool to assess beach health. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Hill, TCJ; Walsh, KA; Harris, JA; Moffett, BF								Using ecological diversity measures with bacterial communities								FEMS MICROBIOLOGY ECOLOGY				43	1			1	11	PII S0168-6496(02)00449-X	10.1016/S0168-6496(02)00449-X			FEB 1 2003	2003	There are many ecological diversity measures, but their suitability for use with highly diverse bacterial communities is unclear and seldom considered. We assessed a range of species richness and evenness/dominance indices, and the use of species abundance models using samples of bacteria from zinc-contaminated and control soils. Bacteria were assigned to operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis of 236 clones from each soil. The reduced diversity apparent in the contaminated soil was reflected by the diversity indices to varying degrees. The number of clones analysed and the weighting given to rare vs. abundant OTUs are the most important considerations when selecting measures. Our preferences, arrived at using theory and practical experience, include: the log series index alpha; the Q statistic (but only if coverage is 50% or more); the Berger-Parker and Simpson's indices, although their ecological relevance may be limited; and, unexpectedly, the Shannon-Wiener and Shannon evenness indices, even though their meanings may not be clear and their values inaccurate when coverage is low. For extrapolation, the equation for the log series distribution seems the best for extrapolating from OTU accumulation curves while non-parametric methods, such as Chao 1, show promise for estimating total OTU richness. Due to a preponderance of single-occurrence OTUs, none of the five species abundance models fit the OTU abundance distribution of the control soil, but both the log and log normal models fit the less diverse contaminated soil. Species abundance models are useful, irrespective of coverage, because they address the whole distribution of a sample, aiding comparison by revealing overall trends as well as specific changes in particular abundance classes.

As organic materials with variable properties, such mulches can be expected to have variable effects on structure of the soil food web and mineralisation of N and P in the root zone. The overall objectives of this study were to: (1) assess the effects of a selection of organic mulches on the abundance of protozoa and nematode trophic groups; (2) use the model of Hunt et al. [Biol. Fertil. Soils 3 (1987) 3931 to assess the implications of changes in microfaunal abundance for microbial turnover and N mineralisation; and (3) determine effects of the mulches on nematode indicators of increased microbial production/turnover and functional diversity of the soil food web. Organic mulch treatments commenced in 1994 and included shredded office paper, municipal biosolids, shredded paper applied over municipal biosolids, shredded paper applied over municipal compost, alfalfa hay, and black polyethylene fabric. The control was conventional tree-row weed management with glyphosate. Biosolids and municipal compost treatments were re-applied in 1997. Protozoan abundance was determined in 1998, 1999 and 2000. Nematode community structure was assessed in 1998, 1999, and twice in 2000. Nematode community parameters evaluated included: abundance of bacterivorous, fungivorous, omnivorous and predacious nematodes; abundance of the root-lesion nematode, Pratylenchus penetrans; absolute and relative abundances of enrichment opportunist nematodes (Rhabditidae + Diplogasteridae + Panagrolaimidae); Simpson's diversity; evenness; and the indices of nematode community enrichment (El) and structure (SI) described by Ferris et al. [Appl. Soil Ecol. 18 (2001) 13]. Measurements of the abundance of enrichment opportunists and the El were evaluated as indicators of enhanced nutrient fluxes. Diversity and the SI were evaluated as indicators of changes in functional diversity of the soil food web. The abundance of protozoa and bacterivorous nematodes, and estimated fluxes of N and P through the microfauna, were greater under all combinations of biosolids or municipal compost and shredded paper than under the control and plastic mulch. The abundance of enrichment opportunist nematodes and the EI were also consistently greater under combinations of biosolids or municipal compost and shredded paper. The abundance of enrichment opportunists and El were both also correlated with leaf P, providing additional evidence to support the use of these parameters as indicators of enhanced turnover of microbial biomass and nutrients. The SI was greatest under shredded paper and shredded paper applied over municipal compost, and		Agr & Agri Food Canada, Pacific Agrifood Res Ctr, Agassiz, BC V0M 1A0, Canada; Agr & Agri Food Canada, Pacific Agrifood Res Ctr, Summerland, BC V0H 1K0, Canada; [Forge, TA] Agr & Agri Food Canada, Pacific Agrifood Res Ctr, Agassiz, BC V0M 1A0, Canada								120							Soil Science	WOS:000179676300004

We define co-dominants as a subset of species that are more abundant and more uniformly distributed than other species in a given sample. We compare the sample with a model community and use Simpson's diversity index to estimate the apparent number of co-dominants. Dominant species determined in this way are responsible for 70-90% of the total measure of abundance in the sample. The statistical significance of the apparent number of co-dominants may be assessed by a randomization test.

Fitting abundance distribution models in tropical arboreal communities of SE Brazil								COMMUNITY ECOLOGY				3	2			169	180		10.1556/ComEc.3.2002.2.4			JUN 2002	2002	The species abundance distribution of ecological communities has been represented through several mathematical models, of which the most common are: geometric series, logseries, lognormal, and a type of broken stick, this latter found only in animal communities. There is no consensus on the underlying biological processes, but initial observations on plant communities related these models to equilibrium and high richness (lognormal), stress or disturbance and low richness (logseries and geometric series). Recently the value of these relationships was challenged, and other descriptors were considered better predictors of richness, disturbance and stress. We aimed at investigating how these models and their parameters, as well as dominance and evenness are related with species richness, stress and disturbance in six tropical forest communities, SE Brazil: two well-conserved fragments, two disturbed by fire, and two swampy forests (anoxic stress). The models did not show consistent relationships with richness, disturbance or stress. The parameters and indices of diversity alpha (logseries) and lambda (lognormal) varied closely with richness, and the dominance was larger in the communities submitted to stress or disturbance. Our results indicate the need of further studies in order to validate (or refute) the use of abundance distribution models for detection of patterns related to richness, stress or disturbance in tropical arboreal communities. On the other hand, richness and dominance did respond to disturbance and stress.		[Cielo Filho, R.; Martins, F.

These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4% for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6% for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson's index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design.

Are there additional implications for assemblage structure? Here we use Berger-Parker d, Simpson's 1/D and Simpson's E to measure the ecological diversity of pristine and perturbed freshwater fish assemblages in Trinidad, West Indies, and Oklahoma, USA. Although the impacted sites typically had fewer species than expected, they could not be distinguished from unperturbed ones of equivalent richness. Changes in the evenness of these assemblages are thus driven by changes in richness. One practical outcome is that diversity indices may not provide independent verification of the detrimental consequences of pollution. The similarity in structure of naturally and anthropogenically impoverished assemblages provides no grounds for complacency, however, since it ignores the evolutionary history of the species concerned. On the basis of our results we suggest that species provenance may be important in tests of ecological function. Moreover, these investigations should replicate natural patterns of evenness as well as richness.

Six sites within the riparian zone were sampled in different portions of the creek. At each site, 3 trees with cryptogams were sampled six times during survey period. From a total of 108 samples, 1,588 tardigrades were extracted and individually mounted on slides in Hoyer's medium. The community was dominated (86%) by specimens in the genus Macrobiotus. One species of Echiniscus was new to science and will be described in a separate paper. No significant difference was found between tardigrade occurrence (total number of individuals) and season, moss genera, or tree species. However, there was a significant relationship between the number of tardigrades and site, indicating the need for additional replicate samples. Simpson's and Shannon-Wiener's species diversity indices indicated that species richness and evenness were low. Jaccard's and Standard's community similarity indices suggested that the communities within the riparian zone were dissimilar along Choccolocco Creek.

Adjacent areas were compared at 1, 7, 12, and 17 years following two reproduction cutting methods (clearcuts or pine seed-tree cuts); a 59-year-old pine stand that was periodically thinned was also included to represent conditions before reproduction cutting. Because average or better natural loblolly and shortleaf pine (Pinus taeda L. and P. echinata Mill.) seed crops coincided with the planned site disturbances, pines dominated the seedling-size classes at 1 and 7 years after reproduction cutting, the sapling-size classes at 7, 12, and 17 years after reproduction cutting, and the small- and large-tree size classes at 12, 17, and 59 years after reproduction cutting. For seedling-size classes, three measures of woody plant diversity (Shannon's (Hl), Simpson's (D), and evenness (e) indices) tended to increase from 1 to 12 years after reproduction cutting. In the sapling-size classes, H ' and D diversity indices were highest at 17 years and lowest at 59 years after reproduction cutting. For small-tree size classes, H ', and D were highest at 7 years and lowest at 12 years after reproduction cutting. Across all but the large-tree size classes, woody species richness peaked 7 years after reproduction cutting, Naturally regenerated pines achieved complete crown closure by 17 years after reproduction cutting; consequently, the presence of shade-tolerant woody plants increased in the understory, and shade-intolerant herbaceous plants disappeared from the forest floor.

J	Parker, JD; Duffy, JE; Orth, RJ								Plant species diversity and composition: experimental effects on marine epifaunal assemblages								MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES				224				55	67		10.3354/meps224055			2001	2001	Plant diversity is believed to govern animal community structure, yet few studies have tested this relationship. We manipulated plant species diversity and composition (2 seagrasses and 3 seaweeds) and measured the abundance, diversity, and biomass of plant-associated macroinvertebrates in a temperate, estuarine seagrass community. Animal diversity was weakly but positively related to plant diversity (Simpson's 1 - lambda). Most indices of animal diversity, however, were more strongly related to total plant surface area than to plant diversity. Epifaunal abundance and biomass increased, whereas epifaunal diversity and evenness decreased with total plant surface area. Both food and habitat covary with plant surface area, providing potential mechanistic explanations for these patterns. Plant species composition had strong effects on epifaunal community structure. After statistically controlling for effects of plant surface area, epifaunal abundance and biomass remained higher, and evenness remained lower, among assemblages composed of branched (mostly seaweeds) relative to unbranched (mostly seagrasses) macrophytes. Multiple regression analyses also revealed differential use of particular plant species by epifauna. For example, amphipods responded particularly strongly to the coarsely branched red alga Gracilaria verrucosa. Thus, our experimental results support a strong effect of plant species composition, and little effect of plant diversity per se, on the motile macrofauna that we studied. This conclusion is consistent with results of a concurrent field survey; epifaunal community structure differed among plant species and seasons, with no host-plant specialists, These results support evidence from both terrestrial and aquatic communities; ecosystem structural and functional properties are often more strongly influenced by particular attributes, rather than number of species, in a community.

J	Therriault, T. W.; Kolasa, J.								Patterns of community variability depend on habitat variability and habitat generalists in natural aquatic microcosms								COMMUNITY ECOLOGY				1	2			195	203		10.1556/ComEc.1.2000.2.9			DEC 2000	2000	Habitat variability is largely an external mechanism influencing community variability by affecting abundances and precipitating other community changes but the nature of this influence is poorly understood. The absence of systematic quantitative studies appears to be a major reason for this deficiency. To address the problem, we have evaluated community and population variability in invertebrate communities collected from 49 coastal Jamaican rock pools with contrasting levels of habitat variability. We calculated a multivariate index of habitat variability based on temporal changes in physicochemical variables. Variability in diversity indices (Simpson's and Shannon-Wiener), evenness (2 measures), and species richness represented community variability while species rank correlations and community constancy represented changes in community structure. Additionally, we analyzed the impact of three habitat generalists (harpacticoid copepod(Nitocra spinipesBoeck), cyclopoid copepod(Orthocyclops modestusHerrick), and the ostracod(Potamocypris sp.))on overall community variability. As habitat variability increased, both community and population variability increased. Community structure (ranked abundances) was more variable in variable habitats compared to non-variable habitats but communities in these variable habitats retained greater constancy of composition suggesting that highly variable habitats are dominated by a few species with good dispersal abilities. Rare species may come and go, but the dominant species persist in these habitats. Habitat generalists influenced temporal community variability differently, especially evenness (based on the Shannon-Wiener index). Positive relationships were found between the variability in evenness and population variability of the ostracod and cyclopoid copepod. A negative relationship was found between the variability in evenness and the variability of harpacticoid copepods. Our study suggests that individual communities or assemblages respond independently and asynchronously to environmental factors, a view originally proposed by Gleason (1917). We conclude that the form of community structure in variable habitats remains constant. The species composition and relative abundances can change over time but the relative abundance of the dominant species stays high and the remaining species, regardless of their numbers, make relatively small contributions to the overall community variability pattern.

First, the behavior of the species richness, Shannon's, and Simpson's diversity indices were determined on polar lipid fatty acid profiles of 115 pure cultures, communities constructed from those profiles with different numbers of species, and constructed communities with different distributions of species. Differences in the species richness of these artificial communities was detected by all three diversity indices, but they were insensitive to the evenness of the distribution of species. Second, data from a field experiment with substrate addition to soil was used to compare the methods developed for lipid- and DNA-based diversity indices. Very good agreement was found between indices calculated from environmental polar lipid fatty acid profiles and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profiles from matched samples (Pearson's correlation coefficient r=0.95-0.96). A method for data pre-treatment for diversity calculations is described. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Hubálek, Z								Measures of species diversity in ecology:: an evaluation								FOLIA ZOOLOGICA				49	4			241	260					2000	2000	Twenty-four measures of species diversity, richness and equitability were compared using both real species abundance data (bird censuses on a standard study plot) and simple simulation tests. Based on 20 criteria, the most recommendable measures for the estimation of alpha diversity of species have been Fager's "number of moves per specimen", exponential Shannon's information (or H'), reciprocal Simpson's lambda, and species richness (number of species). However. the last index is only appropriate when sample sizes are approximately equal otherwise it can be misleading and Hurlbert's rarefaction method should be applied. The other measures tested, especially all equitability indices, have been shown to be problematic and should not be used regularly for the measurement of species diversity.

J	Flach, E; de Bruin, W								Diversity patterns in macrobenthos across a continental slope in the NE Atlantic								JOURNAL OF SEA RESEARCH				42	4			303	323		10.1016/S1385-1101(99)00034-9			DEC 1999	1999	Different estimates were used to assess the diversity of the total macrofauna and its major taxonomic groups separately from a broad bathymetric range at a site in the NE Atlantic. In the Goban Spur region, a transect was sampled from the shelf to the abyssal plain over a depth range from similar to 200 to similar to 4500 m and in the Porcupine Sea Eight two stations were sampled (at 3670 In and 4115 In). Species diversity (the number of species per number of individuals) increased with increasing water depth. both when expressed as Hurlbzrt's E(S-n) and as Shannon's H' log e. The expected number of species in a 100-individual sample E(S-100) of total macrofauna increased from 30 on the shelf to 68 on the abyssal plain. Evenness (the proportional abundance of species), estimated with Shannon's J', also increased with water depth from 0.66 to 0.91, whereas dominance (Simpson's D) decreased from 0.09 to 0.01. Species richness (the number of species per unit of area). however, showed a parabolic pattern with a peak at the upper slope. The largest number of species was found at the slope station at 1425 m (232 species within 0.66 m(2)). It is argued that species richness is not a synonym of species diversity, but that species richness depends both on species density (which decreases with increasing water depth) and on species diversity. Across the whole bathymetric range (similar to 200 to similar to 4500 m) a total of 696 species within 8327 specimens in a total sampled area of 4.12 m(2) were counted, yielding mean values of similar to 12 individuals per species and similar to 169 species pet m(2). Different communities were found to exist on the shelf, slope and abyss. It is suggested that this could have been caused by different selection processes. Differences in life-history strategies and organic-matter supply could (at least partly) explain the different community structures and diversity patterns found along the depth gradient.

J	Leadley, PW; Niklaus, PA; Stocker, R; Körner, C								A field study of the effects of elevated CO<sub>2</sub> on plant biomass and community structure in a calcareous grassland								OECOLOGIA				118	1			39	49		10.1007/s004420050701			JAN 1999	1999	The effects of elevated CO2 on plant biomass and community structure have been studied for four seasons in a calcareous grassland in northwest Switzerland. This highly diverse, semi-natural plant community is dominated by the perennial grass Bromus erectus and is mown twice a year to maintain species composition. Plots of 1.3 m(2) were exposed to ambient or elevated CO2 concentrations (n = 8) using a novel CO2 exposure technique, screen-aided CO2 control (SACC) starting in March 1994. In the 1st year of treatment, the annual harvested biomass (sum of aboveground biomass from mowings in June and October) was not significantly affected by elevated CO2. However, biomass increased significantly at elevated CO2 in the 2nd (+20%, P = 0.05), 3rd (+21%, P = 0.02) and 4th years (+29%, P = 0.02). There were no detectable differences in root biomass in the top 8 cm of soil between CO2 treatments on eight out of nine sampling dates. There were significant differences in CO2 responsiveness between functional groups (legumes, non-leguminous forbs, graminoids) in the 2nd (P = 0.07) and 3rd (P < 0.001) years of the study. The order of CO2 responsiveness among functional groups changed substantially from the 2nd to the 3rd year; for example, non-leguminous forbs had the smallest relative response in the 2nd year and the largest in the 3rd year. By the 3rd year of CO2 exposure, large species-specific differences in CO2 response had developed. For five important species or genera the order of responsiveness was Lotus corniculatus (+271%), Carex flacca (+249%), Bromus erectus (+ 33%), Sanguisorba minor (no significant CO2 effect), and six Trifolium species (a negative response that was not significant). The positive CO2 responses in Bromus and Carex were most closely related to increases in tiller number. Species richness was not affected by CO2 treatment, but species evenness increased under elevated CO2 (modified Hill ratio; P = 0.03) in June of the 3rd year, resulting in a marginally significant increase in species diversity (Simpson's index; P = 0.09). This and other experiments with calcareous grassland plants show that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations can substantially alter the structure of calcareous grassland communities and may increase plant community biomass.

J	Azarbayjani, FF; Richardson, BJ								Monitoring for changes in arboreal arthropod biodiversity in woodlands: how many replicates are needed?								TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF NEW SOUTH WALES								40	45					1999	1999	To measure the level of replication needed to detect changes in arboreal arthropods, a data set based on the arthropod faunas of 26 replicate trees of the species Melaleuca linariifolia was analysed. Analysis showed that the number of species, individuals per tree and Chao 1 estimation of species per tree were not normally distributed and that this was best corrected by using log transformed data. It was found that 20 replicates were needed to detect a 23% change in the observed number of species per tree in the study population. The estimation of the ct diversity index and the Chao 1 estimation of the number of species per tree required even larger numbers of replicates for the same precision. Detecting changes in the evenness of diversity, measured as Simpson's D or equitability E, also required large numbers of replicates. In practice, more replication than that suggested by this study will be needed as many relevant sources of increase in variance, for example time and location, were avoided and this almost certainty reduced the standard deviation between trees. It is clear that further exploration of the measurement of species level biological diversity Is urgently needed. For the present, richness, evenness and the number of individuals which are independent of one another, should all be reported in biodiversity studies.

J	Clarke, KR; Warwick, RM								A taxonomic distinctness index and its statistical properties								JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY				35	4			523	531		10.1046/j.1365-2664.1998.3540523.x			AUG 1998	1998	1. For biological community data (species-by-sample abundance matrices), Warwick & Clarke (1995) defined two biodiversity indices, capturing the structure not only of the distribution of abundances amongst species but also the taxonomic relatedness of the species in each sample. The first index. taxonomic diversity (Delta), can be thought of as the average taxonomic 'distance' between any two organisms, chosen at random from the sample: this distance can be visualized simply as the length of the path connecting these two organisms, traced through (say) a Linnean or phylogenetic classification of the full set of species involved. The second index, taxonomic distinctness (Delta*), is the average path length between any two randomly chosen individuals, conditional on them being from different species. This is equivalent to dividing taxonomic diversity, Delta, by the value it would take were there to be no taxonomic hierarchy tall species belonging to the same genus). Delta* can therefore be seen as a measure of pure taxonomic relatedness. whereas Delta mixes taxonomic relatedness with the evenness properties of the abundance distribution. 2. This paper explores the statistical sampling properties of Delta and Delta*. Taxonomic diversity is seen to be a natural extension of a form of Simpson's index, incorporating taxonomic (or phylogenetic) information. Importantly for practical comparisons, both Delta and Delta* are shown not to be dependent, on average, on the degree of sampling effort involved in the data collection; this is in sharp contrast with those diversity measures that are strongly influenced by the number of observed species. 3. The special case where the data consist only of presence/absence information is dealt with in detail: Delta and Delta* converge to the same statistic (Delta(+)), which is now defined as the average taxonomic path length between any two randomly chosen species. Its lack of dependence, in mean value, on sampling effort implies that Delta(+) can be compared across studies with differing and uncontrolled degrees of sampling effort (subject to assumptions concerning comparable taxonomic accuracy). This may be of particular significance for historic (diffusely collected) species lists from different localities or regions, which at first sight may seem unamenable to valid diversity comparison of any sort. 4. Furthermore, a randomization test is possible, to detect a difference in the taxonomic distinctness, for any observed set of species. from the 'expected' Delta(+) value derived from a master species list for the relevant group of organisms. The exact randomization procedure requires heavy computation, and an approximation is developed, by deriving an appropriate variance formula. This leads to a 'confidence funnel' against which distinctness values for any specific area, pollution condition, habitat type, etc., can be checked, and formally addresses the question of whether a putatively impacted locality has a 'lower than expected' taxonomic spread. The procedure is illustrated for the UK species list of free-living marine nematodes and sets of samples from intertidal sites in two localities, the Exe estuary and the Firth of Clyde.

J	Jones, MD; Durall, DM; Harniman, SMK; Classen, DC; Simard, SW								Ectomycorrhizal diversity on Betula papyrifera and Pseudotsuga menziesii seedlings grown in the greenhouse or outplanted in single-species and mixed plots in southern British Columbia								CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH				27	11			1872	1889		10.1139/cjfr-27-11-1872			NOV 1997	1997	The inoculum potential and diversity of the ectomycorrhizal fungal community usually decrease on a site following logging. The objective of this study was to determine if planting a mixture of tree species following logging retains a higher diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi than planting a single species. Paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) were planted either alone or in mixture and in different proportions and densities on each of three sites in the southern interior of British Columbia. Ectomycorrbizal types were characterized following detailed morphological examination on 12 seedlings per plot at 4, 16, and 28 months following out planting (field bioassay). Thelephora, E-strain, Rhizpogon (for Douglas-fir only), Mycelium radicis atrovirens, and Cenococcum mycorrhizae were the most abundant. The Thelephora mycorrhizae decreased in dominance over the sampling period from 82 to 41% of ectomycorrhizae on birch and from 26 to 15% on Douglas-fir. Rhizopogon mycorrhizae remained consistently abundant an Douglas-fir roots (36% of mycorrhizae at 4 months to 37% at 28 months). By 28 mouths, 91% of birch and 56% of Douglas-fir mycorrhizae were types common to the two species. This has important implications for possible nutrient of carbon transfer between the two species. At 16 (P = 0.068) and 28 months (P = 0.088) following outplanting, the evenness of the ectomycorrhizal community on Douglas-fir root systems was higher in mixed than in single-species plots. Richness (number of ectomycorrhizal types) and Simpson's diversity index per seedling were not affected by tree mixture treatments. Planting density did not affect richness, evenness, or diversity. The ectomycorrhizae that developed an Douglas-fir or birch seedlings grown in the greenhouse in soils from these sites were very similar to those that developed in the field. This demonstrates that greenhouse bioassays can be used to predict which types of ectomycorrbizae will form on seedlings grown on disturbed sites, at least for the first few years following outplanting.

J	Montalvo, AM; Conard, SG; Conkle, MT; Hodgskiss, PD								Population structure, genetic diversity, and clone formation in Quercus chrysolepis (Fagaceae)								AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY				84	11			1553	1564		10.2307/2446617			NOV 1997	1997	Stands of canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis, Fagaceae) are maintained for fuelwood, fire management, recreation, and as habitat for wildlife. Information about the link between the oak's reproductive ecology and its extent of genetic diversity is important in developing land management policies that will maintain the long-term viability of populations. Basal sprouting is the primary means of reproduction following fire or cutting, and stands frequently include groups of visibly connected trees in a clustered distribution that suggests cloning. We determined the extent to which clusters of trees were clonal and defined the spatial pattern and diversity of genotypes fbr six populations across nearly the entire east-west extent of the San Bernardino Mountains in southern California. We mapped over 100 trees at each of five sires and genotyped each tree for allozymes at seven polymorphic loci. We identified clones using these multilocus genotypes and detected an average of 34.4 +/- 7.3 (SD) clones per site, most of which had unique genotypes. In general, clustered trees belong to single clones and most clones consist of few trees (mean = 3.4 +/- 0.6 trees per clone). However, clone size increased significantly with increased individual heterozygosity, suggesting that selection may favor highly heterozygous clones. Clonal diversity and evenness were high relative to reports for most other clonal species; an average of 97% of clones had distinct genotypes, and Simpson's index of diversity averaged 0.95 +/- 0.02. Population genetic analyses of 319 clones from six sites revealed high genetic diversity within sites (mean H-s = 0.443). Only a small proportion of the total genetic diversity was explained by variation among sites (mean G(ST) = 0.018), which is consistent with high gene flow among sites (N-m = 9.5). We found no significant substructure among plots within sites, and fixation indices within sites were generally small, suggesting that either little inbreeding occurs, and/or few inbred progeny survive. However, spatial autocorrelation analysis of clones indicated fine-scale genetic structure at distances under 4 m, possibly due to limited seed dispersal. Our data suggest that guidelines for seed collection of canyon live oak for use in restoration can be specified in a manner similar to that recommended for conifer species within the region studied.

J	Cao, M; Zhang, JH								Tree species diversity of tropical forest vegetation in Xishuangbanna, SW China								BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION				6	7			995	1006		10.1023/A:1018367630923			JUL 1997	1997	Tree species diversity of four tropical forest vegetation types was investigated in Xishuangbanna, southwestern China. These are: tropical seasonal rain forest, tropical montane rain forest, evergreen broad-leaved forest and monsoon forest over limestone. A total of 17 samples were taken and four species diversity indices were calculated: Shannon-Wiener's H', the complement of Simpson's index, d', Fisher's alpha and evenness index E. The results reveal the long-tailed rank/abundance diagrams of these forests. However, this feature is greatly reduced in the samples of monsoon forest over limestone. Tropical seasonal rain forest shows the highest tree species diversity of all four vegetation types. Owing to the variation of microenvironment, diversity values within the same vegetation type vary between the samples from different patches. The tree species diversity of single-dominant rain forest is not significantly lower than that of mixed rain forest, because the dominant species of some single-dominant rain forests are principally in the emergent layer. This is composed of sparse and huge trees of one species and, consequently, creates a unique canopy architecture and more heterogeneous microenvironments for the more diversified species composition under the emergent layer. The occurrence of tree species with small population sizes, particularly of species represented by only one individual, is highly correlated with the tree species diversity of the local forest vegetation. They are crucial elements in the richness of local biodiversity.

J	Hill, MO								An evenness statistic based on the abundance-weighted variance of species proportions								OIKOS				79	2			413	416		10.2307/3546027			JUN 1997	1997	A measure of diversity can be based on Simpson's index lambda, which is the abundance-weighted mean of species proportions. Likewise, an index of evenness, E-MS = (Sigma p(i)(2))(2)/Sigma p(i)(3), can be based on the abundance-weighted coefficient of variation of species proportions p(i). E-MS measures the shape of the species-abundance relation, and is 0.75 + 0.25 lambda(2) for the geometric series distribution. This simple relation allows the geometric series to be used as a benchmark; communities that have relatively long 'tails' of rare species have correspondingly low evenness, whereas communities with short 'tails' have high evenness. Except for species richness, there is no necessity to reject the view that diversity and evenness are measurable parameters of a community rather than statistics of a sample.

The phytoplankton data were derived from three reference data sets characterising different trophic levels: (a) from inshore Saronikos Gulf waters characterising eutrophication; (b) from offshore waters of Saronikos Gulf representing mesotrophic conditions; and (c) from the oligotrophic offshore waters of the Island of Rhodes, Aegean Sea. Some of the commonly used indices such as the Simpson's, Shannon's and Margalef's indices seemed to be unsuitable for identifying eutrophic trends. On the other hand, the Menhinick's index, Kothe's index, Species Evenness, Species Number and Total Number of Individuals were found effective for distinguishing oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic waters, the most efficient being the Kothe's and Species Number indices. These indices were used to propose a classification scheme for characterising oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic waters in the Eastern Mediterranean. The experimental approach described in the present work can be used for water characterization in any waterbody, provided there are data available for setting up standard datasets that can define reference conditions.

The mussel beds are located on intertidal sand bars in the mouth of two Danish fjords with similar hydrographical conditions. We test the hypothesis that species diversity, abundance and distribution of the associated fauna at spatial scales of mussel patches is an effect of patch size irrespective of location and position within a patch. A statistical analysis using a hierarchical nested three-factorial ANOVA was performed on numbers of individuals, number of species and numbers in certain higher taxa. Furthermore, comparisons of diversity by using Jackknife estimates of species richness/evenness and the non-parametric Simpson's Index of Diversity were made. The results showed that effects of patch size and position within a patch were inconsistent but differences between stations were pronounced. The fauna at both sites was dominated by mobile species and primary colonizers. The difference in composition between locations indicated higher organic enrichment at Kerteminde. The use of Jackknife estimates of species richness/evenness and Simpson's Index of Diversity was found to be insufficient to describe differences compared to the hierarchical nested ANOVA since the latter provides statistical tests and an estimate of the contribution of the variation at each scale.

We assemble criteria for an appropriate index for the evenness of a biological sample. The most important criterion is that evenness should be independent of species richness. Twelve previously proposed indices and variants are considered, and two apparently new indices. Four indices are recommended as joint best buys: A) If symmetry between minor and abundant species is not important, or if it is required that the index be less affected by minor species: 1) If it is essential that the index be able to reach a minimum of zero with any particular number of species, or if the shape of the index response to an evenness gradient is important: E(1/D) (based on a common form of Simpson's index). 2) If good mid-range behaviour is desired: E' (proposed by Camargo). B) If equal sensitivity to minor and abundant species is required: 1) If the shape of the index response to an evenness gradient is not important, the clear winner is: E(Q) (a new index). 2) If the shape Is Important: E(var) (another new index). The overall recommendation for general use is E(var).		UNIV OTAGO, DEPT BOT, DUNEDIN, NEW ZEALAND								872							Ecology	WOS:A1996UY43300008

The concept of ecosystem diversity, number kinds, and patterns of landscape ecosystems and their processes, was introduced and illustrated. The 4000-ha area has been highly disturbed by logging and repeated post-logging fires. Early successional species now dominate the overstory of upland ecosystems. Twenty-one upland landscape ecosystem groups were identified, classified described, and mapped on the basis of interrelationships among climate, physiography, soil, and vegetation. Six landscape ecosystem groups, representative of extremes along moisture, nutrient, and microclimate gradients, were selected for the analysis of alpha and beta diversity of ground-cover vegetation. Alpha diversity indices calculated were species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity Shannon-Wiener evenness, and Simpson's index. Beta diversity was measured by percentage similarity and Jaccard's coefficient. The most moist and nutrient-rich ecosystem group had the highest alpha diversity. The general pattern of decreasing alpha diversity was moist and nutrient-rich, moderately moist and moderately nutrient-rich, dry and nutrient-rich, moist and nutrient-poor and climatically extreme, dry and nutrient-Poor and climatically extreme, and dry and nutrient-poor. Beta diversity analysis revealed significant between-ecosystem diversity, despite the fact that the landscape appears relatively flat and strongly dominated by big-tooth (Populus grandidentata Michx.) and trembling (P. tremuloides Michx.) aspens. The richness of landscape ecosystems among four regional landscapes in Michigan, including the Biological Station was contrasted and described. Greater ecosystem richness of the Biological Station reflects greater geologic-physiographic complexity of the area due to its glacial history. Distinguishing and mapping landscape ecosystems proves an excellent framework for assessing alpha and beta diversity of plant species and for similar analyses of whole landscape ecosystems and their processes.

To identify the deciding environment gradient the data from the parallel phytocoenological and pedological observations were subjected to the canonical correspondence analysis carried out by the program CANOCO. The forest stands were differentiated according to the content of humus and granulometric composition of the soil. The analysis carried out by the program Fytan was one of the methods used for evaluation of ecological conditions by means of the Ellenberg's indication values. Its results confirm a relatively high habitat variability and, when comparing with the literature data, also a lower humidity. The Simpson's index of diversity lambda, Shannon-Weaver's index H', species richness index R1 (Margalef) and R2 (Menhinick) and indices of evenness E1 - E3 were used for evaluation of species richness and diversity of the studied stands. The individual diversity indices fluctuated within the following limits: H': 2.53-2.66, lambda: 4.85- 5.45, R1. 3.92-4.15, R2: 2.31-2.41.

J	Birks, H. J. B.; Line, J. M.								The use of rarefaction analysis for estimating palynological richness from Quaternary pollen-analytical data								HOLOCENE				2	1			1	10		10.1177/095968369200200101			MAR 1992	1992	Reconstructing temporal changes in diversity from pollen assemblages is potentially important both palaeoecologically and ecologically because community diversity may, in part, result from historical processes. The use of diversity indices such as Shannon's information index or Simpson's index is not appropriate with pollen percentage data because such indices consider both the numbers of different taxa and their relative frequencies or representation. The latter aspect in pollen data is inevitably influenced by inherent differences in pollen production and dispersal. The total number of taxa present in a sample is a robust and useful measure of palynological richness if. and only if, all the pollen counts are standardized to a fixed number of grains. Rarefaction analysis implements such a standardization and provides minimum variance unbiased estimates of the expected number of taxa (I) in a random sample of n individuals taken from a larger collection of N individuals containing T taxa. The underlying mathematical theory of rarefaction analysis and its important biological and palaeoecological assumptions are discussed. The use of rarefaction analysis is illustrated with three data-sets: Crose Mere. central England (0-c, 12 500 BP); Abernethy Forest, eastern Scotland (5500-12 100 BP); and three sites (Lochs Ashik. Cleat, Meodal) on the Isle of Skye. western Scotland, all covering the last 10 500 years. Palynological richness, as estimated by rarefaction analysis, is high in the protocratic phase (c. 9500-12 500 BP). low in the mesocratic phase (c. 5500-9500 BP). low in the oligocratic phase (0-c. 5500 BP), and high in the Homo sapiens phase (0-c. 5000 BP) of the Holocene. Although factors such as local site characteristics and pollen production, dispersal. and input may influence temporal changes in richness, changes in palynological richness are interpreted as reflecting predominantly the changing floristic richness of the vegetation types in the pollen-source area of a lake and the changing mosaic structure of the landscape through time. Intermediate levels of disturbance, either natural in the protocratic phase or anthropogenic in the Homo sapiens phase appear to be important in maximizing richness at the landscape scale by preventing the dominance of any single component but insufficient to cause extinction of components at the landscape scale.

J	GHENT, AW								INSIGHTS INTO DIVERSITY AND NICHE BREADTH ANALYSES FROM EXACT SMALL-SAMPLE TESTS OF THE EQUAL ABUNDANCE HYPOTHESIS								AMERICAN MIDLAND NATURALIST				126	2			213	255		10.2307/2426100			OCT 1991	1991	Exact test procedures are detailed for niche breadth as the general case, and for diversity as a subset of niche breadth analysis. Numerators of niche breadth probabilities are obtained as chain multiplications of three individually simple combinatorial calculations, only two of which are needed in analyses of species diversity. Algebraic checks on counts of terms and sums of numerators are developed. The two-niche case is used to demonstrate the high probabilities associated with high niche diversity, these effectively limiting tests for significant nonrandomness to the low diversity tail. Examination of diversity indices as rank-ordering devices reveals that all the common indices (Shannon's H', Brillouin's H, Simpson's C' and its close relatives) yield rank orders identical to some algebraic functions of the equiprobable 1:1:..:1 model, so that any use of these indices locks us into the equiprobable model no matter what alternative model we may claim as our intended interest. These common indices are found to yield very similar rank orderings, so that the likelihood of disagreement with a "correct" ordering is less than 5% for neighboring partitions of N organisms into n niches or s species, and much less than 5% for randomly selected partitions, even if a diversity index is selected at random without regard for its theoretical suitabilities. The statistical expectation of Simpson's C' (the complement of Simpson's original index) is found to be (n - 1)/n for n niches regardless of N, and to be (s - 1)/s for s species, to four decimal places or more, if species diversity sampling is continued until each species is represented on average by 7.5 individuals or more. The "evenness" measures V' and V, representing ratios of observed to maximum values of diversity indices, are found to attain values of 0.99 or more at the 50th percentiles of the probability distributions of diversity indices and are judged to be ecologically misleading and valueless. The claim that there is anything about Brillouin's H that suits it more to a census than a sample is disputed. Simpson's C' is recommended as the most serviceable of the examined indices, both because of the simple formulae for its statistical expectations and because its rank orderings are found to be identical to those given by the variance (or its square root) of the counts of species or niche occupants.
